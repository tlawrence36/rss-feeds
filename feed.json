      "Marvin Levy, Steven Spielberg\u2019s publicist for over four decades and the only person in his field to be recognized with an Oscar, has died. He was 96.",
      "Levy died Monday in Los Angeles surrounded by loved ones, representatives for Amblin Entertainment said Wednesday. No cause was given.",
      "\u201cMarvin\u2019s passing is a huge loss for me and our industry writ large. There are many talented PR executives, but Marvin was one of a kind,\u201d Spielberg said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful for all our years together. Marvin never failed to make me laugh, he never stopped smiling. We will miss you Marvin. You will always be in our hearts and your memory will always make us smile.\u201d",
      "Levy's long-standing partnership with Spielberg made him one of the most renowned and respected publicists in Hollywood. Over his 70-year career, he worked on campaigns for film classics like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cKramer vs. Kramer,\u201d \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\" \u201cJurassic Park\" and \"Gladiator.\"",
      "In 2018, Levy, a long-standing member of the film academy's public relations branch, became the first and only publicist to receive an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No publicist\u2019s name had even been put forth for the award before Levy's.",
      "\u201cIt was way out of left field for me. I couldn\u2019t have imagined it,\u201d Levy told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could say \u2018Gee, I\u2019d love to get that one day.\u2019 It was not on my to-do list.\u201d",
      "Born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1928, Levy was raised on the east side and attended New York University. Though he never set out to be a publicist specifically, he knew he had a way with words. One of his first jobs was writing questions for a TV quiz show. But he was fired when his \u201cbig ticket\u201d question was answered too early in the season.",
      "His first publicity job was at MGM in New York, where he was so far down on the ladder that he never got to travel to Los Angeles, but where he worked on campaigns for films like \u201cGigi\u201d and \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d By the time the company was remaking \u201cMutiny on the Bounty,\" he knew it was time to move on.",
      "Levy soon found his way to legendary publicists Arthur Canton and Bill Blowitz, and then Columbia Pictures which took him to California. It was during that time that he first started working with Spielberg who was fresh off \u201cJaws.\u201d He was told he was only to concentrate on \u201cClose Encounters.\" By 1982, he went full time with Spielberg and wouldn\u2019t look back.",
      "While he had many highs in the industry, Levy also recalled a big heartbreak when \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d lost the best picture trophy to \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d at the 71st Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cThat was the toughest night of my life in terms of the business,\u201d Levy said. But he put on a brave face at the Governor's Ball following the ceremony.",
      "Tom Hanks presented the honorary Oscar to Levy in 2018, noting that it takes, \u201cSomething of a storyteller to get an audience hooked on the story without giving away the story.\u201d",
      "Levy remained devoted to Spielberg, and Amblin Entertainment, up to his full retirement in 2024. For him, it never got old.",
      "\u201cHow lucky can you be? I mean it,\u201d he said in 2018. \u201cWe work for the best filmmaker around.\u201d",
      "Levy is survived by his wife of 73 years, Carol, their two sons, Don and Doug, and two grandsons, Brian and Daniel.",

      "Springtime sunshine has finally hit New York City, and that means the Met Gala beckons",
      "NEW YORK -- As springtime sunshine finally hits New York City, the Met Gala beckons \u2014 one of the most anticipated and visible parties in the world.",
      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",
      "Here are some key things to know as fashion's biggest night approaches:",
      "The gala happens the first Monday in May \u2014 this year, May 5.",
      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",
      "Each year brings a new group of celebrity co-chairs. This year they are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and A$AP Rocky \u2014 along with Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who always oversees the proceedings. NBA superstar LeBron James is honorary chair.",
      "Word on attendees trickles out slowly in the weeks leading up to the event. But this year there\u2019s also a huge additional host committee with stars from various fields. (They don\u2019t have specific host duties, other than showing up and, it goes without saying, looking fabulous.)",
      "It includes athletes Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens, Angel Reese and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson; filmmakers Spike Lee, Tonya Lewis Lee and Regina King; and actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and musicians Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "Also in the group are author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; artists Jordan Casteel, Rashid Johnson and Kara Walker; playwrights Jeremy O. Harris and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins; and fashion figures Grace Wales Bonner, Edward Enninful, Dapper Dan and Olivier Rousteing.",
      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

      "The self-proclaimed \u201crock & roll survivalist\u201d started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie\u2019s website.

      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",

There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",

      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

      "For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree",
      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "The American Library Association has unveiled the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",
      "Most of the books listed have LGBTQ+ themes, continuing a yearslong trend. Other objections include references to drug addiction, such as in Ellen Hopkins' \u201cCrank,\u201d and to slavery and sexual abuse, including those in Patricia McCormick's \u201cSold.\u201d",
      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

      "North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent.",

      "Hollywood megastar Tom Hardy has reunited with director Guy Ritchie 17 years after \u201cRocknRolla\u201d for a new TV series, \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",

      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",

      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",

      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met with Texas officials Monday to determine how many people it would send to West Texas to assist with the outbreak response, spokesman Jason McDonald said Monday.

      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",

      "A new study suggests that health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling",
      "Health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling, a new study suggests, an important finding as the U.S. confronts it 11th leading cause of death.",
      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",
      "Reductions varied and reached up to 25%, said lead author Brian Ahmedani, of Henry Ford Health.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the year, that\u2019s up to 165 to 170 suicide attempts that were prevented at these participating health care systems,\u201d Ahmedani said.",
      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are coming into contact with people who are at high risk for suicide. If we don\u2019t ask them, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Keyes who was not involved in the new study.",
      "Grants from the National Institute of Mental Health funded the research.",
      "\u201cComplex health problems like suicide cannot be challenged effectively without federal leadership,\u201d said Mike Hogan, who led mental health systems in Connecticut, Ohio and New York, and chaired President George W. Bush\u2019s commission on mental health in 2002 and 2003.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important research report, confirming that reducing suicide among people in health systems is possible,\u201d Hogan said.",

      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas' still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.",
      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s social media post said CDC employees had been \u201credeployed.\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald clarified late Sunday that the first CDC team arrived in early March and left Gaines County on April 1, while a team led by Patel \u201cwas redeployed and arrived today to assess needs\" as ordered by Kennedy and requested by Texas' governor.",
      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

      "\u201cThe peace agreement will not collapse, but it will be shaking in the way that there will be suspension for those who are loyal to Machar and the supporters of Machar will then fight the system,\u201d Kuol told The Associated Press.",

      "South Sudan\u2019s political climate remains fragile after White Army overran and army base in the north and government troops responded with airstrikes. Government forces also staged two attacks on opposition forces' training barracks outside the capital, Juba.",

      "Bongo was placed in house arrest after the coup but freed a week later due to health concerns. His wife and son were detained and charged with corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Bongo himself was not charged.",
      "Following the coup, soldiers proclaimed Oligui Nguema, the Republican Guard chief and a cousin of Bongo, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. He promised to \u201creturn power to civilians\u201d through \u201ccredible elections.\u201d",
      "In March, Oligui Nguema announced he would run in the presidential election. Seven others are running. Election observers from the African Union and European Union will be present on election day, Gabon's foreign ministry has said.",
      "Gabon\u2019s parliament in January adopted a new electoral code. The legislation was contentious. It allows military personnel to be candidates in all elections, which hadn't been possible in the past. It also paved the way for Oligui Nguema to run.",
      "Gabon\u2019s new constitution, adopted in a referendum in November, sets the presidential term at seven years, renewable once.",
      "Oligui Nguema\u2019s main challenger is Bongo\u2019s former prime minister Alain Claude Bilie-By-Nze. He has promised to reorganize public finances, create jobs for young people and \u201cend the umbilical cord\u201d with former colonial ruler France.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Bilie-By-Nze asserted that the upcoming election is not fair or transparent.",
      "\u201cEverything has been done to lock down the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ministry of the interior and the various electoral commissions are run by people close to the putschist candidate. The ruling candidate also benefits from all the resources of the state for his campaign, while his opponents received no public funding.\u201d",
      "Bilie-By-Nze pledged \u201ca break with the old system and a new independence. Political, diplomatic and economic independence.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday, the country is returning to normal. In every country in the world, it is the ministry of the interior that organizes elections,\u201d Laurence Ndong, the spokeswoman for Oligui Nguema, told the AP, and asserted: \u201cFor the first time, Gabon will have a free and transparent election.\u201d",
      "She added that under the new electoral code, all candidates had the right to ask for reimbursement of their campaign costs up to a certain amount, and \u201cdepending on the election result, they are reimbursed or not.\u201d",
      "While France and its military forces have been pushed out of several African nations in recent years, Gabon has not signaled any change in having a French military presence. Approximately 350 French troops are in the country.",
      "\u201cNo subject is off limits,\u201d Bilie-By-Nze told the AP. \u201cFrance is an important partner for Gabon, but we must reexamine certain aspects of our cooperation to rebalance them responsibly.\u201d",
      "Oligui Nguema is expected to win Saturday's election, political analysts say.",
      "\u201cWhile Nguema is associated with the fall of the Bongo dynasty, Bilie-By-Nze is seen as having in the past contributed to maintaining in place a regime that was visibly despised by almost the entire population,\u201d said Serge Loungou, a senior lecturer of political geography at Omar Bongo University.",
      "Bongo served two terms after taking power in 2009 following the death of his father, who ruled for 41 years. There was widespread discontent with the family\u2019s reign. A small political elite lived in oil-funded luxury while much of the population struggled. More than a third of the population lived under the poverty line in 2022, according the the World Bank.",
      "The central African country of around 2.3 million is a member of OPEC, and oil export revenue was $6 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But nearly 40% of Gabonese between 15 and 24 were out of work in 2022, according to the World Bank.",
      "Gabon\u2019s economy grew by 2.9% in 2024, up from 2.4% in 2023, fueled by a surge in infrastructure projects under the transitional government and increased production of key commodities, including oil, manganese, and timber.",
      "Gabon has been well-known for its biodiversity and conservation interest under Bongo, and it was not immediately clear how the increased production of timber has affected that.",

      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\u201cWe are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\u201d she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",
      "He practiced law and headed the supervisory board of investment manager BlackRock\u2019s German branch. During that break, he often travelled for business to the United States and China, though he never lived outside Germany.",
      "Volker Resing, who wrote the recent biography \u201cFriedrich Merz: His Path to Power,\" says that Merz would possibly be \u201cthe most international chancellor\" Germany has had since 1945.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "But he persisted and was finally elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz does not believe in avoiding confrontation at all costs, but believes that \u201ca certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\u201d",
      "During the election campaign, Merz vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Donald Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong transatlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz\u2019s tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Germans took to the streets to protest against both Merz' motion and also the rise of the far right.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to \u201cnever\u201d work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany\u2019s parliament \u2014 an area where people are \u201crather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\u201d Resing said. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped him: rural life.\u201d",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law, and they have three grown children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes would fly his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\u201d Resing said. \"He says that when you\u2019re above the clouds, that\u2019s freedom.\u201d",

      "Japan, which has stepped up defense ties with the United States, its key ally, and other friendly nations in the Indo-Pacific, has also sought closer ties with NATO, fearing that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could embolden China\u2019s assertiveness in the region.",
      "\u201cA stronger NATO will benefit Japan greatly,\u201d Ishiba told a joint news conference after his talks with Rutte, who was in Japan for the first time since becoming secretary general of the organization in October.",
      "In a joint statement released after their talks, Ishiba and Rutte said strengthening defense industrial cooperation is \u201ca shared priority\u201d and that they plan to focus on developing dual-use and advanced technologies while enhancing their standardization. They also agreed to step up cooperation in cyber defense and space, as well as joint military exercises. Drones and Artificial Intelligence were also discussed.",
      "Ishiba and Rutte also stated they \u201cstrongly condemn\u201d growing military ties between North Korea and Russia, including Russia\u2019s use of North Korean missiles and troops against Ukraine, while expressing concern about China\u2019s support for the Russian defense industrial base.",
      "Russia continues to wage war against Ukraine while maintaining its ambitions to \u201creshape European security,\u201d Rutte said.",
      "Both also called for upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific and opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas, and encouraged Beijing to improve the transparency of its military and to cooperate in arms control, calling on peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.",
      "The NATO chief told reporters that China has been pursuing a major military buildup, seeking to control key technologies, critical infrastructure and supply chains, and continues to carry out \u201cdestabilizing activities\u201d in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Rutte praised Japan\u2019s contributions to support Ukraine in the war against Russia, and welcomed Tokyo\u2019s willingness to participate in a NATO command for the support of Ukraine, expressed by Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Tuesday.",
      "The NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine, or NSATU, is headquartered at a U.S. military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. Rutte said NSATU \u201chelps Ukraine fight today but also for Ukraine to build up its armed forces for tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Details of Japan\u2019s participation still need to be discussed, but the Japanese Self Defense Force, if stationed, is not expected to involve combative roles because of the country\u2019s postwar pacifist principles.",

      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- Nigerian health authorities are struggling to contain a rapidly spreading meningitis outbreak that has so far killed 151 people across the west African nation, mostly in remote parts of the northern region with children affected the most.",
      "While cases first recorded in October have spread to 23 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, nearly half of the deaths, 74, were reported this year, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control said this week, with local partners describing the recent rise in fatalities as \u201calarming.\u201d",
      "Most deaths from the disease have been mainly due to infected people not going to health facilities or arriving there late with severe complications, NCDC spokesperson Sani Datti told The Associated Press, a common problem in past outbreaks in the country.",
      "The current outbreak has hit Africa\u2019s most populous country as its health sector reels from U.S. aid cuts ordered by the Trump administration in February that have affected multiple countries. Nigeria relied heavily on such aid over the years to help fight similar outbreaks and support its underfunded healthcare systems.",
      "Seasonal meningitis outbreaks are common during the dry season, especially in northern Nigeria. Almost all the worst-hit states are in the north, where health providers have warned the outbreak is rapidly spreading in hard-to-reach areas.",
      "Meningitis, more common during the hot season in Nigeria, affects the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It\u2019s a major public health challenge for a country already grappling with \u201cthe world\u2019s highest burden of malaria,\u201d according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Last week, Nigeria received the first batch of more than 1 million vaccine doses from the global vaccine alliance Gavi, described by local officials as a crucial milestone in disease response.",
      "The Nigeria CDC also said it is working with state authorities to scale up disease surveillance with a focus on tracking new cases, laboratory testing, and public sensitization campaigns to curb the outbreak.",
      "Campaigns are also being rolled out, urging residents to take precautionary measures and seek immediate medical attention if they are experiencing symptoms such as high fever, stiff neck and severe headaches.",
      "However, access to hospitals remains a huge problem, local partners say.",

      "United Nations officials say the Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen",
      "CAIRO -- The Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world's poorest and most war-ravaged countries, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The United States had initially cut funding for projects in more than a dozen countries, part of a dramatic reduction of foreign aid led by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Aid officials warned the cuts would deny food to millions of people and end health programs for women and children.",
      "The administration informed the World Food Program of its reversal on Tuesday, according to two U.N. officials. An official with the U.S. Agency for International Development confirmed that Jeremy Lewin, the Musk associate overseeing the dismantling of USAID, had ordered the reversal of some of his weekend contract terminations on Tuesday, after The Associated Press reported the cuts.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media.",
      "The WFP said Monday it had been notified that USAID was cutting funding to the U.N. agency\u2019s emergency food program in 14 countries.",
      "It was not immediately clear Wednesday how many of those cutoffs still stood.",
      "One of the U.N. officials said the decision to restore funding came after intense behind-the-scenes lobbying of members of Congress by senior U.N. officials.",
      "The cuts could prove disastrous for millions in Afghanistan and Yemen, reeling from decades of war and U.S.-led campaigns against militants.",
      "The U.S. had been the major funder of the WFP, providing $4.5 billion of the $9.8 billion in donations to the world's largest food aid provider last year. Previous administrations had viewed such aid as a way of alleviating conflict and combating poverty and extremism while curbing migration.",
      "The Trump administration has accused USAID of advancing liberal causes, and has criticized foreign aid more broadly as a waste of resources.",
      "U.S. officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce acknowledged on Tuesday that some of the programs had been cut by mistake and said funding had been restored, without providing details.",
      "More than half of Afghanistan\u2019s population \u2014 some 23 million people \u2014 need humanitarian assistance. It's a crisis caused by decades of conflict \u2014 including the 20-year U.S. war with the Taliban \u2014 as well as entrenched poverty and climate shocks.",
      "Last year, the United States provided 43% of all international humanitarian funding to Afghanistan.",
      "Some $560 million in humanitarian aid has been cut, including for emergency food assistance, treatment of malnourished babies, medical care, safe drinking water and mental health treatment for survivors of sexual and physical violence, according to an assessment by current and former USAID officials and partner organizations. The figure has not been confirmed by the U.S. government.",
      "A separate WFP assessment obtained by the AP showed that food assistance to 2 million people in Afghanistan would be terminated later this year. More than 650,000 malnourished children, mothers and pregnant women would would lose nutritional support.",
      "The United Nations Population Fund said the U.S. had cut $100 million in support for maternal health services for millions of women, as well as gender-based violence services.",
      "The International Rescue Committee said the cuts would affect nearly 1 million people. Its programs include nutritional assistance for tens of thousands of children under 5, as well as counseling services.",
      "\u201cKids who have seen great violence, who benefit from social work and psychosocial care that we provide, will be cut off,\u201d said Bob Kitchen, head of global emergencies for the aid group.",
      "The poorest Arab country was plunged into civil war in 2014 when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized much of the north, including the capital, Sanaa. The U.S. supported a Saudi-led coalition that intervened the following year on behalf of the government. The conflict has been at a stalemate in recent years.",
      "The war has led to widespread hunger, and experts warned as recently as 2024 that parts of Yemen were at risk of famine.",
      "The U.S. cuts would end life-saving food assistance to 2.4 million people and halt nutritional care for 100,000 children, according to the WFP assessment.",
      "The U.S. is carrying out a campaign of airstrikes against the Houthis in retaliation for their attacks on international shipping linked to the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The WFP had already suspended its programs in Houthi-ruled northern Yemen, where the rebels have detained dozens of U.N. staffers as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the now-shuttered U.S. Embassy.",
      "The latest cuts would affect southern Yemen, where the internationally recognized government opposed to the Houthis is based. The WFP assessment warned that halting aid there \u201ccarries significant political and security implications and risks deepening the economic crisis and exacerbating instability.\u201d",
      "Last year, the WFP assisted 8.6 million people in Yemen, more than a quarter of its population, including more than 330,000 internally displaced people and 1.2 million with disabilities. Half were women and children.",

      "LONDON -- The British government has refused to rule out nationalizing the last plant in the U.K. that makes steel from raw materials as the global trade war increases pressure to preserve the nation\u2019s ability to supply domestic industry with the steel it needs.",
      "The Scunthorpe steel works operated by British Steel may soon run out of the iron pellets used to produce steel in two massive blast furnaces unless the government steps in, according to local politicians and unions. That\u2019s because the plant\u2019s owner, China\u2019s Jingye Group, canceled orders for these essential raw materials amid negotiations for increased government support.",
      "The news comes two weeks after British Steel said it was considering closing the blast furnaces because they are no longer financially sustainable due to \u201cchallenging market conditions,\u201d tariffs and increased environmental costs.",
      "The government is continuing negotiations with the company after Jingye rejected an offer of 500 million pounds ($640 million) to help modernize the plant. When asked on Tuesday what the government was prepared to do to keep the plant open, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to steel production in Britain.",
      "\u201cAll options are on the table in relation to Scunthorpe,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee.",
      "British Steel and its forebears have been making steel at Scunthorpe for more than 130 years, building on the U.K.\u2019s development of improved steelmaking technology during the Industrial Revolution. The plant currently employs about 2,700 people.",
      "Jingye bought British Steel in 2020 and says it has invested more than 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) to keep the plant running in the face of \u201congoing production instability.\u201d",
      "Nationwide, U.K. steel output has fallen 80% since the late 1960s due to high production costs and the rapid growth of Chinese production, which pushed down prices around the world.",
      "Britain, the world\u2019s fifth-largest steelmaker in 1970, produced just 5.6 million tons of steel in 2023, or 0.3% of global output. By comparison China produced 1.02 billion tons, or 54% of worldwide production.",
      "Britain\u2019s remaining steelmakers are now under pressure to reduce carbon emissions amid the threat of global warming. Most have shifted to electric arc furnaces that make steel from recycled material.",
      "That has left Scunthorpe as the only factory with blast furnaces capable of turning iron ore into virgin steel.",
      "Union officials say British Steel needs to order more iron pellets within the next few days to ensure delivery before the plant runs out of raw materials in late May.",
      "\u201cWe are in real threat of losing these furnaces,\u201d Thomas Smith, a steelworker and representative of the trade union Community, told Sky News this week. \u201cIf we miss them deadlines we\u2019ll come to a point where we\u2019ll have to make a decision whether we turn them both off,\u201d he added.",
      "During a debate in the House of Commons on Monday, lawmakers said Britain needed its own steelmaking industry to preserve its economic independence amid a burgeoning trade war fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new import tariffs.",
      "Martin Vickers, a member of Parliament who represents the area adjacent to Scunthorpe, said he believes Jingye isn\u2019t involved in \u201cmeaningful negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have come round to the view that nationalization on a temporary basis is, in this instance, the only way,\u201d he said Monday in the House of Commons. \u201cIt will secure the jobs and secure a future for steel production in Scunthorpe.\u201d",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones said Jingye was continuing to talk with the government.",
      "\u201cWe have been clear in our belief that the best way forward is for Scunthorpe and British Steel to continue as a commercially-run business with private investment and with the government acting in support,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can tell the honorable gentleman that no options are off the table.\u201d",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran's president again pledged Wednesday that his nation is \u201cnot after a nuclear bomb\u201d ahead of talks between Tehran and the United States, going as far as dangling the prospect of direct American investment in the Islamic Republic if the countries can reach a deal.",
      "The comments by reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian represent a departure from Iran's stance after its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, in which Tehran sought to buy American airplanes but in effect barred U.S. companies from coming into the country.",
      "\u201cHis excellency has no opposition to investment by American investors in Iran,\" Pezeshkian said in a speech in Tehran, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"American investors: Come and invest.\u201d",
      "Such a business proposal could draw the interest of U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew America from Iran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in his first term and now seeks a new agreement with the country.",
      "Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a platform of outreach to the West during his election last year, also added that Saturday's talks in Oman between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff would be conducted \u201cindirectly.\u201d Trump has said the talks would be direct negotiations \u2014 something Tehran hasn't ruled out after the first round of discussions.",
      "\u201cWe are not after a nuclear bomb,\" Pezeshkian added. \u201cYou (in the West) have verified it 100 times. Do it 1,000 times again.\u201d",

      "Lego has opened a $1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy",
      "BINH DUONG, Vietnam -- Lego opened a $1 billion factory in Vietnam on Wednesday that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.",
      "The factory in the industrial area of Binh Duong, close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.",
      "It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colorful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia\u2019s growing markets.",
      "\u201cWe just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there. That is functional,\u201d Lego CEO Niels Christiansen told The Associated Press.",
      "The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37% by 2032. The privately held group makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic and says it has invested more than $1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.",
      "Fast-industrializing Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy. The country hopes the plant\u2019s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing.",
      "The blocks are made from differently colored plastic grains that are melted at high temperatures and then fed into metal molds. The highly-automated factory uses robots for making the bricks to a tenth of a hair's width precision and then packaging them. It eventually will employ thousands of mostly skilled workers to operate these machines, Some of them have already begun work after being trained in in Lego's factory in eastern China.",
      "Manufacturing makes up a fifth of Vietnam's GDP and consumes half the energy it uses. There are plans to phase out its coal power plants by 2040.",
      "The Lego factory, which spans 62 soccer fields, sets the \u201cblueprint\u201d for making large, power-guzzling factories sustainable while remaining profitable, said Mimi Vu, a founder of the consultancy Raise Partners in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cSometimes it takes a big company, like Lego, to take those risks. To show that we can do it \u2026 And we can be profitable,\u201d she said.",
      "The factory will benefit from a new 2024 rule known as a direct power purchase agreement or DPPA, which allows big foreign companies to buy clean energy directly from solar and wind power producers and to meet their clean energy requirements.",
      "The factory will be linked to an adjacent energy center where electricity can be stored in large batteries.",
      "\u201cSo even if the sun is only shining during the day, we store the energy and can use it all over. That will cover by far the majority of the consumption of the factory,\u201d added Christiansen,",
      "The remaining 10%-20% of the factory's energy needs will be met through agreements with other clean energy producers.",
      "\u201cLego and Vietnam, we are having the same aspirations. We both want to be green, to play our part in the climate. And I think this with the solar and battery and DPPA, it is showcasing that it can be done,\u201d Jesper Hassellund Mikkelsen, Senior Vice President Asia Operations at the LEGO Group told The AP.",
      "The company will also open a distribution center in Vietnam's southern Dong Nai province to help serve markets in Australia and other Asian countries where it sees an opportunity for growth. Locating the Lego factories in regions they supply helps to insulate them from the tariffs ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Christiansen said.",
      "\u201cRight now, I am probably more observant of what does this mean to growth in the world? Do we see consumer sentiment changing in parts of the world or not, and what would that potentially mean?\" he said.",
      "The five buildings in the factory meet high energy efficiency standards. Lego also has planted 50,000 trees \u2013 twice the number of the trees it cut to clear land for the factory. It's the first Lego factory to replace single-use plastic bags with paper bags for packaging.",
      "Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen, started the company as a wooden toy maker before patenting the iconic plastic bricks in 1958. It is still is seeking a way to make its plastic bricks more environmentally friendly.",
      "Christiansen said Lego bricks last decades and could be reused, though the ultimately ambition is to make them out of more renewable materials. He said that a third of the materials used in Lego bricks made last year were from renewable and recycled sources. But that's more expensive than plastic made out of fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not inexpensive at this point in time, but we believe if we ... lean into that, we help create a supply chain for the type of plastic materials that are not based on fossil fuel,\u201d he said.",

      "Kim died of old age and his official funeral is set for Saturday, Kim\u2019s Sungrak Church in Seoul said. It said Kim was survived by his wife, whom he met after resettling in South Korea, and two children \u2013 a son and a daughter.",
      "Kim was among a team of 31 North Korean commandos who tried to storm South Korea\u2019s mountainside presidential palace to assassinate Park, an authoritarian president who had been ruling South Korea with an iron-fist since 1961.",
      "The North Koreans had slipped undetected through the Koreas\u2019 heavily fortified border and came within striking distance of Park\u2019s palace. After battles that raged for two weeks in the nearby hills, all but three of the intruders were killed. Two survivors were believed to have returned to North Korea, while Kim was the only one captured alive by South Korean forces.",
      "In a news conference arranged by South Korean authorities, Kim stunned the nation by saying that his team came \u201cto slit the throat of Park Chung-hee.\u201d",
      "The infiltration, which also killed about 30 South Koreans, happened at the height of Cold War rivalry between the rival Koreas which was split into the U.S.-backed South and the Soviet-supported North at the end of the World War II in 1945. After the incident, Park\u2019s government launched reservist forces, established a military unit tasked with attacking North Korea, had students take military training at schools and introduced residential registration card systems.",
      "In media interviews, Kim said he was pardoned because he didn\u2019t fire a single bullet during the shootouts and was persuaded by South Korean officials to disavow communism. He said South Korean intelligence authorities later had him travel across the country to make speeches critical of North Korean systems at schools, companies and other places.",
      "Kim said he later learned that his parents in North Korea were executed. Kim was ordained as a pastor in 1997.",
      "Kim said the 1968 attack was made at the order of North Korea founder and then leader Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un. Kim Il Sung died of heart attack in 1994, handing over power to his son Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cI earlier didn\u2019t know why Kim Il Sung wanted to kill President Park,\u201d Kim Shin-jo said in a 2009 interview with South Korea's mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper. \u201cBut I came to know the reason as I spent time here. Kim must have been afraid of a poor country such as South Korea becoming rich. As the economy improved, South Korea would secure more money to buy weapons. From Kim Il Sung\u2019s perspective, he couldn\u2019t help killing President Park to achieve communization of South Korea.\u201d",
      "But in a 2007 autobiography by Park Geun-hye, daughter of Park Chung-hee who became South Korea's first woman president in 2013, she said when she met Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2022, the younger Kim said the 1968 incident was orchestrated by \u201cextremists\u201d as he apologized for the incident. Park Geun-hye said Kim Jong Il told her that they all received unspecified due punishments.",

      "It's an example of how far China will go to influence politicians overseas, and how that pressure can succeed behind closed doors.",
      "In the past year, lawmakers from Malawi and Gambia withdrew from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, or IPAC, a group of hundreds of lawmakers from 38 countries concerned about how democracies approach Beijing, according to letters, messages and voice recordings obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Founded in 2020, the group has coordinated sanctions on China over rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and rallied support for Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "African politicians and experts say it\u2019s an escalation of Chinese diplomatic pressure in Africa, where Beijing's influence is growing. Beijing has built deep ties with African leaders by developing mines and building infrastructure through state-owned construction companies, often funded by loans from state-owned banks.",
      "The pressure is also part of Beijing's longstanding effort to influence groups and lawmakers across the world, including in New York state, where a former governor\u2019s aide faces charges for acting as an agent for the Chinese government.",
      "In January, Gambian lawmaker Abdoulie Ceesay sent a voice message to an IPAC staffer saying the Chinese government had complained to the Gambian foreign ministry about his membership.",
      "\u201cWe have very shocking news \u2026 it\u2019s a problem right now,\u201d Ceesay said in the recording, which IPAC provided to AP. \u201cThe president is not happy with us at all.\u201d",
      "Later the same month, Ceesay and fellow lawmaker Amadou Camara informed the alliance they were withdrawing. Ceesay told IPAC in a written message that his decision was \u201cnot influenced by the Chinese embassy,\u201d a position Ceesay reiterated when contacted by AP.",
      "Gambia's information minister said he was unaware of any attempt by China to influence his country's politicians.",

      "The Chinese government has targeted lawmakers over the alliance before. Beijing has sanctioned some members and last year, lawmakers from at least six countries were pressured by Chinese diplomats not to attend the group\u2019s summit in Taiwan. Kenyan lawmakers cancelled their plans to attend but stayed in the alliance. The group was also targeted by Chinese state-sponsored hackers in 2021, according to a U.S. indictment.",
      "\u201cForeign legislators are being bullied out of a free alliance between them and other politicians,\u201d said IPAC head Luke de Pulford. \u201cThis is clearly a result of Chinese pressure.\u201d",

      "Less than two weeks after the summit, the two Malawian lawmakers said they were withdrawing. Kayembe said in a letter to IPAC that he had been tricked into joining.",
      "\u201cI want to extend my sincere apology to the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Kayembe wrote in the Aug. 7 letter.",
      "When contacted by AP, Kayembe denied being coerced by the Malawi or Chinese governments, writing in an email that he withdrew because the alliance appeared \u201caimed at achieving geopolitical intentions against China.\u201d",
      "Malawi\u2019s government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "For decades, Beijing has cultivated ties with African governments, seeking diplomatic partners and access to natural resources.",
      "Many African leaders have welcomed Beijing\u2019s presence since it brings much-needed capital and construction expertise that can contribute to economic growth and development. Critics say China strikes secretive, sometimes corrupt deals with African leaders that mainly benefit Chinese companies and workers brought in to build mines, bridges and railways.",
      "\u201cChina has been investing and being present in African countries when many countries were not willing to come,\u201d said Christian-Geraud Neema, Africa editor of the China Global South Project, an independent research group.",

But China has pressured African governments to shun Taiwan or Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, efforts that Neema says appear to be escalating. Last October, South Africa demanded that Taipei move its unofficial embassy out of the administrative capital, Pretoria, and in January, Beijing sanctioned the head of South Africa\u2019s second-largest political party for visiting Taiwan.",
      "Moves like these mirror efforts China has made against governments elsewhere in the past. Beijing blocked exports from Lithuania, for example, after the northern European country allowed Taiwan to open a trade office.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said Wednesday that his country will offer temporary shelter to Palestinian medical evacuees and children orphaned by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to evacuate those who are injured or traumatized, and orphans, if they want to be evacuated to Indonesia, and we are ready to send planes to transport them,\u201d Subianto said, adding that he has instructed his foreign affairs minister to discuss evacuation plans with the Palestinian authorities at once.",
      "He said Indonesia is ready to evacuate a first batch of around 1,000 victims, who will stay in the country until they have fully recovered from their injuries and Gaza is safe enough to return to. Subianto said the move was not for permanent resettlement.",
      "Subianto spoke before getting on a flight to Abu Dhabi, the first stop in a weeklong tour of the Middle East that also includes stops in Turkey, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan. He said he would consult on the planned evacuations with those countries, some of which have also accepted Palestinians for humanitarian reasons.",
      "He added that other countries have called on Indonesia to increase its role in seeking a resolution to the conflict in Gaza. The world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinians.",
      "\u201cThis is something complicated; it's not easy, but I think it encourages the Indonesian government to play a more active role,\u201d Subianto said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday mocked Washington and its Asian allies for what she called their \u201cdaydream\u201d of denuclearizing the North, insisting that the country will never give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The statement by Kim Yo Jong, one of the country's top foreign policy officials, was in response to a meeting last week between the top diplomats of the United States, South Korea and Japan where they reaffirmed their commitment to push for the North\u2019s denuclearization.",
      "Noting that North Korea\u2019s goals for nuclear weapons expansion are enshrined in its constitution, she insisted that any external discussions of denuclearization constitute \u201cthe most hostile act\u201d and amount to a denial of her country\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. and its vassal forces continue to insist on anachronistic \u2018denuclearization\u2019 \u2026 it will only give unlimited justness and justification to the advance of the DPRK aspiring after the building of the strongest nuclear force for self-defense,\u201d she said in comments released by state media, using the initials of North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. She said North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons status can \u201cnever be reversed by any physical strength or sly artifice.\u201d",
      "Tensions in the regions have increased as Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his military nuclear capabilities and align with Russia over President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Kim is ignoring calls by Seoul and Washington to resume denuclearization talks.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, but the North has not responded to that offer. Trump and Kim met three times during Trump\u2019s first term, but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements about ending U.S.-led sanctions in return for North Korea taking steps to wind down its nuclear and missile programs.",
      "Kim\u2019s foreign policy priority is now Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and troops to help prolong its warfighting in Ukraine. Seoul fears that Kim may receive economic assistance and advanced technology to develop his arsenal in exchange for its military supporting Russia.",
      "Kim Yo Jong\u2019s statement came a day after South Korea fired warning shots to repel a group of North Korean soldiers who had crossed the border. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said about 10 North Korean soldiers, some carrying weapons, violated the military demarcation line in the eastern section of the border. When South Korea issued warnings and fired warning shots, they did not return fire and returned to North Korea.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether acting president Han Duck-soo discussed the North Korean nuclear threat with U.S. President Donald Trump during a telephone conversation on Tuesday.",
      "Trump said in a social media post that the two leaders discussed tariffs, trade and Seoul\u2019s payment for what he called the \u201cbig time\u201d military protection the United States provides to South Korea. There are concerns in Seoul that Trump might push South Korea to pay significantly more of the costs for the some 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.",

      "The strikes hit around Hodeida's al-Hawak district, the rebels said, and wounded 16 people. The area is home to the city's airport, which the rebels have used in the past to target shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "Since its start, the intense campaign of U.S. airstrikes targeting the rebels over their attacks on shipping in Mideast waters \u2014 related to the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 has killed at least 81 people, according to casualty figures released by the Houthis.",
      "Footage aired by the rebels' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed chaotic scenes of people carrying wounded to waiting ambulances and rescuers searching by the light of their mobile phones. The target appeared in the footage to be a home in a residential neighborhood, likely part of a wider decapitation campaign launched by the Trump administration to kill rebel leaders.",
      "Other strikes targeted Yemen's mountainous Amran governorate, north of the rebel-held capital of Sanaa. There, the Houthis described American strikes hitting telecommunication equipment. Previous U.S. strikes also targeted telecommunications gear in Amran near Jebel Aswad, or the \u201cBlack Mountain.\u201d",
      "Strikes later apparently targeted Jebel Nuqum, near Sanaa. Others hit Dhamar and Ibb governorates, wounding three.",
      "The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees American military operations, did not immediately acknowledge the strikes. That follows a pattern for the command, which now has authorization from the White House to conduct strikes at will in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "The American military also hasn't been providing any information on targets hit. The White House has said over 200 strikes have been conducted so far.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking in the Oval Office on Monday during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warned that America was \u201cnot going to relent\u201d in its campaign targeting the Houthis.",
      "\u201cSo we have a lot more options and a lot more pressure to apply,\u201d Hegseth said. \"And we know, because we see the reports, how devastating this campaign has been in them. And we will not relent.\u201d",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program as well.",

      "He reported himself to the police Tuesday to formally acknowledge the charges and then was taken to Phitsanulok Provincial Court for a pretrial detention hearing, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group.",
      "It said the court approved the police request for pretrial detention and denied Chambers\u2019 initial application for release on bail, as well as a second later request. The legal aid group said another request to allow bail would be filed to an appeals court on Wednesday. No trial date has been set.",
      "The officer who answered the phone at the police station handling the case said he could not comment, and referred the matter to his chief, who did not answer a call to his phone.",

Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has been used to punish critics of the government and institutions such as the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticism of it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has in the past decade grown louder, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020, began openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law.",
      "Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the lese majeste law.",

      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60% of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "But Walmart faces challenges with the new tariffs because they carry more economic risks than during Trump's first term. A wave of new price increases would deal a blow to its lower- and middle-income shoppers who have already been pulling back in the last year or so because of still-high inflation on necessities.",

      "Loyal customers of Asian supermarkets and other grocery stores that specialize in selling imported food are wondering what will happen to prices given the extra-high tariffs President Donald Trump put on goods from dozens of countries",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Loyal customers of Asian supermarkets and other grocery stores that specialize in selling imported food heaved a collective sigh of dismay when President Donald Trump announced extra-high U.S. tariffs on goods from dozens of countries.",
      "What would happen to prices at 99 Ranch Market and H Mart?, wondered Asian Americans and immigrants who shop at the two American chains for preferred brands like Japan's Kewpie mayonnaise and China's Pearl River light soy sauce.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to be crying in H Mart,\u201d a TikTok user commiserated, referencing the title of a bestselling memoir by Korean American musician Michelle Zauner as other posters shared videos of their \u201cpre-tariff hauls\u201d from Asian supermarkets.",
      "The steeper tariff rates Trump set for imports from nations he accused of unfair trade practices took effect first thing Wednesday along with a 10% baseline tax on products from the rest of the world.",
      "Several countries in Asia have some of the largest levies, including South Korea (25%), Vietnam (47%) and Cambodia (49%). After China approved counter-tariffs and said it would fight a U.S. trade war \u201cto the end,\u201d the president on Tuesday raised the rate on Chinese goods to 104%.",
      "At a 99 Ranch Market less than a mile from the UCLA campus, one of the California-based chain's 58 stores, regular shopper Artis Chitchamnueng said he won't be able to go anywhere else to find the foods he likes if prices skyrocket.",
      "\u201cI think (Trump's) just like playing a lot of like mind games of just trying to like take control of the market and stuff like that,\" Chitchamnueng, a part-time worker and entrepreneur, said. Many customers have said on social media they don't know if they will be able to continue doing their routine grocery shopping at 99 Ranch Market.",
      "Even if mainstream grocers stock some of the same items, a lot of imported items are less expensive at the specialty supermarkets. An 18-ounce bottle of Lee Kum Kee Panda oyster sauce, for example, retails for $3.99 at 99 Ranch. The websites for Safeway and Walmart list the same bottle for $4.79 and $10.45, respectively.",
      "The stores stocking a wide range of noodles, dried vegetables, herbs and skin care products from China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam can be a source of comfort for immigrants and foreign students craving the tastes of home.",
      "Tony He, an international student at UCLA, said Trump's tariff policies confused him but he would continue shopping at 99 Ranch to get his groceries if prices increase. \u201cAs long as I need Asian food, I usually come here,\u201d He said.",
      "Shopping for culturally specific foods, drinks and condiments in the U.S. has come a long way from the once-meager offerings found in the \u201cethnic food\u201d aisles of American supermarkets. International supermarkets and small grocery stores across the country generated $55.8 billion in revenue last year, according to market research firm IBISWorld.",
      "The sector has recorded an annual growth rate of roughly 3% since 2019, and an IBISWorld forecast predicted revenue for grocery stores with international brands would go up to over $64 billion by 2029.",
      "Analysts attribute the increase in demand to the growth of Asian and Hispanic immigrant populations, as well as to the tastes of younger consumers who enjoy experiencing new flavors. Mass market stores and brands increasingly have stocked or created Americanized versions of Asian products to ride the trend.",
      "The specialty rice used for sushi that mainstream supermarkets sell also is usually imported from South Korea, China or Japan, noted Nancy Qian, a professor of economics at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. She thinks tariffs may lead consumers to find alternatives for their favorite brands.",
      "\u201cWhen my parents first came to America in the '80s from China, they couldn\u2019t really get the same type of rice as they did in China, So they switched to a different type of rice,\u201d Qian said. \u201cI think families and restaurants and people, they\u2019ll do what it takes to make ends meet. And they\u2019ll substitute foods. They\u2019ll buy new foods.\u201d",
      "Independent shops that are integral to smaller Asian American communities are also bracing for a hit. The owner of Not Just Spices, a tiny South Asian grocery in Providence, Rhode Island, said he was concerned about costs rising costs for everyday products such as basmati rice sourced from India and Pakistan, or the smaller-grained Kalijira rice from his native Bangladesh.",
      "\u201cWhen things are cheaper, people usually buy extra. Now they buy exactly what they need,\u201d said Mohammed Islam, who has run Not Just Spices since 1998. \u201cPeople are scared of spending any money because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be happening.\u201d",
      "Trump announced a tariff of 37% on goods from Bangladesh, 26% on neighboring India's products, 29% on items from Pakistan and a whopping 44% on imports from the island country of Sri Lanka, known for its cinnamon and other spices.",
      "If he does have to raise prices as the tariff\u2019s impacts start to hit supplies, Islam trusts his customers won\u2019t blame him.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t complain because it\u2019s already in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one who is raising the price.\u201d",
      "Customers at Hispanic supermarkets also may be shopping more carefully. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 25% tariff on most imports from Mexico.",
      "In Phoenix, roommates Andrew Colvin and Mario Aviles typically patronize Los Altos Ranch Market, where they say the bulk of the produce and snacks they buy are from Mexico. The sprawling supermarket, which includes a deli and a bakery, is one of the 115 stores the Heritage Grocers Group operates in six states.",
      "\u201cWe expect pretty much everything to go up,\u201d said Colvin, who was stocking up on Parrot canned coconut water, his favorite drink, in case the price goes up. \u201cI probably eat 14 avocados a week. There\u2019ll be a lot less of that.\u201d",
      "Aviles doesn\u2019t want to shop elsewhere. If tariffs result in serious sticker shock, he is prepared to restrict himself instead.",
      "\u201cNo more avocados, no more mangoes, no more orange,\u201d Aviles said.",
      "Some experts say it wouldn\u2019t hurt to stock up on non-perishables within limits and individual household budgets. But shoppers need to avoid the \u201cpanic buying\u201d that accompanied the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could create shortages and cause additional price increases, Qian said.",
      "While it's not yet clear how much of the tariffs will get passed onto U.S. consumers, researchers say any price increases would disproportionately affect low-income households.",
      "\u201cThese are regressive taxes. And for the elementary reason that affluent people do not spend 100% of their incomes and disadvantaged people do,\u201d Steven Durlauf, director of the University of Chicago's Stone Center for Research on Wealth Inequality and Mobility.",
      "Northwestern University's Qian said the cumulative economic impacts of Trump administration tariffs may hold one possible silver lining if they bring people back to the cultural enclaves of major cities.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the old Chinatowns, or the old, like, Little Italys of America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason that those places became really important for their communities was because that was the only place where you can get the thing you wanted.\u201d",

      "Delta Airlines pulled its guidance for 2025 Wednesday as the trade war scrambles expectations for business and household spending and depresses bookings across the travel sector.",
      "\u201cWith broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday. \"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control. This includes reducing planned capacity growth in the second half of the year to flat over last year while actively managing costs and capital expenditures.\u201d",
      "In the first quarter, Delta earned $240 million, or 37 cents per share. A year earlier it earned $37 million, or 6 cents per share.",
      "Stripping out certain items, earnings were 46 cents per share. That's better than the 40 cents per share analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.",
      "Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. were flat before the opening bell. But the sector has been battered this year as investors, anticipating trouble from rising tariffs, put their money elsewhere. Shares are down 41% this year for the nation's most profitable airline, which is better than rivals American and United.",
      "Quarterly operating revenue climbed to $14.04 billion from $13.75 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $13.81 billion.",
      "The average fuel price per gallon declined to $2.47 from $2.79.",
      "Delta cut its first-quarter earnings and revenue outlook last month, saying at the time that a recent decline in consumer and corporate confidence amid growing uncertainty over the economy was weakening domestic demand.",
      "Delta said in March that it expected first-quarter revenue to rise between 3% and 4% compared with a year earlier, down from projections of 7% and 9%.",
      "In January, Delta released fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street\u2019s profit and revenue estimates, as the company benefited from strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Yet conditions have deteriorated since then with a burgeoning trade war leaving consumers and businesses unsure about what comes next. Both have begun to pull back on spending, and that includes travel.",
      "Bastian said Delta foresees June quarter profitability of $1.5 to $2 billion but will not update its full-year outlook \u201cgiven the lack of economic clarity.\u201d",
      "The airline previously said that it expected 2025 earnings of more than $7.35 per share and free cash flow of more than $4 billion. At the time the company was expecting strong travel demand to continue.",
      "A month ago Bastian affirmed the company's full-year guidance. Speaking at the JPMorgan Industrial Conference, the executive said at the time that Delta was feeling good about where it was at.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve been through these last couple of months to indicate there\u2019s any cracks in any of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe anticipate margins continuing to expand and we think margins will expand this year, even with the slower start to the year.\u201d",
      "But Bastian also noted that Delta would continue to monitor the situation and would make adjustments to its outlook if needed.",

      "BERLIN -- Conservative and center-left parties reached a deal to form a new German government on Wednesday after weeks of negotiations. The agreement paves the way for new leadership in Europe\u2019s biggest economy after months of political drift.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, is expected to become Germany\u2019s next leader under the agreement, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The parties involved sent an invitation to a news conference on the coalition deal at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT).",
      "Merz\u2019s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany\u2019s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz\u2019s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority.",
      "It\u2019s still going to be a little while before parliament can elect Merz as chancellor, perhaps in early May. Before that can happen, the coalition deal will need approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats\u2019 membership and by a convention of Merz\u2019s CDU.",
      "Details of the agreement weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "But already last month, the two sides pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that\u2019s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy.",

      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with a bevy of worries about the economic impacts of the president\u2019s sweeping tariff strategy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Manufacturers struggling to make long-term plans. Farmers facing retaliation from Chinese buyers. U.S. households burdened with higher prices.",
      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with those worries and many more as they fret about the economic impact of the president's sweeping tariff strategy that went into effect Wednesday.",
      "In a Senate hearing and interviews with reporters this week, Republican skepticism of President Donald Trump's policies ran unusually high. While GOP lawmakers made sure to direct their concern at Trump's aides and advisers \u2014 particularly U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who appeared before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday \u2014 it still amounted to a rare Republican break from a president they have otherwise championed.",
      "Lawmakers had reason to worry: the stock market has been in a volatile tumble for days and economists are warning that the plans could lead to a recession.",
      "\"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer as he pressed for an answer on which Trump aide to hold accountable if there is an economic downturn.",
      "Tillis' frustration was aimed at the across-the-board tariff strategy that could potentially hamstring U.S. manufacturers who are currently dependent on materials like aluminum and steel from China. His home state of North Carolina, where he is up for reelection next year, has attracted thousands of foreign firms looking to invest in the state's manufacturing industries.",
      "Ever wary of crossing Trump, Republicans engaged in a delicate two-step of criticizing the rollout of the tariffs then shifting to praise for the president's economic vision. In the afternoon, Tillis in a Senate floor speech said that the \u201cpresident is right in challenging other nations who have for decades abused their relationship with the United States,\" yet went on to question who in the White House was thinking through the long-term economic effects of the sweeping tariffs.",
      "Tillis even allowed that Trump's trade strategy could still turn out to be effective, but said there is a short window to show that it is worth the higher prices and layoffs that will burden workers.",
      "For his part, Greer emphasized to the committee that the U.S. was engaged in negotiations with other countries but that \u201cthe trade deficit has been decades in the making, and it's not going to be solved overnight.\u201d",
      "Republican leaders in Congress, as well as a sizeable chunk of lawmakers, have emphasized that Trump needs time to implement his strategy. They've mostly rejected the idea of putting a check on Trump's tariff power, but it is clear that anxiety is growing among rank-and-file Republicans about what's ahead.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said there is a company in his state that had spent \u201cmillions of dollars\" moving its parts production from China to Vietnam. But now that Vietnam is facing steep tariffs, the business is unable to move forward with negotiating prices with retailers.",
      "Lankford pressed Greer for a timeline for negotiations, but the trade representative responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any particular timeline. The outcome is more important than setting something artificially for us.\u201d",
      "Trade agreements between countries typically take months or even years to work out and often require the parties to navigate through a host of legal, economic and business issues. Still, Republicans said they were encouraged by the indications that Trump is entering into negotiations with other nations.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said at the committee hearing that he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by news of trade negotiations and attributed a momentary upward tick in the stock market to \u201chope that these tariffs are a means and not solely an end.\u201d",
      "He told Greer, \"Who pays these high tariffs? It will be the consumer. I\u2019m worried about the inflationary effect. I\u2019m worried if there is a trade war that we\u2019re going to have markets shutting down for American farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.\u201d",
      "Other GOP lawmakers contended that the pain was worth bearing. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the president is on the right track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pain, but it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president will make the right call. He\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Still, traditional Republicans were looking for ways to push back on Trump's tariff plan.",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican, has introduced a bipartisan bill to give Congress the power to review and approve of new tariffs, and Republican members in the House were also working to gain support for a similar bill. Such legislation would allow Congress to claw back some of its constitutional power over tariff policy, which has been almost completely handed over to the president in recent decades through legislation.",
      "But the White House has already indicated that Trump would veto the bill, and both Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have said they are not interested in bringing it up for a vote.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican closely aligned with Trump, said on social media that the bill was a bad idea because \u201cCongress moves at the pace of a tortoise running a race.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason why Congress gave this authority to the president to begin with is because the ability to pivot,\u201d he added.",
      "But the president's unclear messaging has also left lawmakers only guessing as they try to decipher which advisers and aides hold sway in the White House.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said that as he\u2019s received calls from the business community in his state, he\u2019s had no answers for them besides telling them the prospects for the economy are uncertain. The communication from the president\u2019s aides has often been conflicting, Kennedy said even as he voiced support for Trump\u2019s long-term goals.",
      "Kennedy told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to double or triple your tariffs on the world when you're the wealthiest country in all of human history without being somewhat shambolic.\"",

      "Economists are puzzled to see Trump trying to overhaul the existing economic order and doing it so soon after inheriting the strongest economy in the world. Many of the trading partners he accuses of ripping off U.S. businesses and workers were already floundering.",
      "\u201cThere is a deep irony in Trump claiming unfair treatment of the American economy at a time when it was growing robustly while every other major economy had stalled or was losing growth momentum,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cIn an even greater irony, the Trump tariffs are likely to end America\u2019s remarkable run of success and crash the economy, job growth and financial markets.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump and his trade advisers insist that the rules governing global commerce put the United States at a distinct disadvantage. But mainstream economists \u2014 whose views Trump and his advisers disdain \u2014 say the president has a warped idea of world trade, especially a preoccupation with trade deficits, which they say do nothing to impede growth.",
      "The administration accuses other countries of erecting unfair trade barriers to keep out American exports and using underhanded tactics to promote their own. In Trump\u2019s telling, his tariffs are a long-overdue reckoning: The U.S. is the victim of an economic mugging by Europe, China, Mexico, Japan and even Canada.",
      "It's true that some countries charge higher taxes on imports than the United States does. Some manipulate their currencies lower to ensure that their goods are price-competitive in international markets. Some governments lavish their industries with subsidies to give them an edge.",
      "However, the United States is still the second-largest exporter in the world, after China. The U.S. exported $3.1 trillion of goods and services in 2023, far ahead of third-place Germany at $2 trillion.",
      "The fear that Trump\u2019s remedies are deadlier than the maladies he\u2019s trying to cure has sent investors fleeing American stocks. Since Trump announced sweeping import taxes on April 2, the S&P 500 has cratered 12%.",
      "Trump and his advisers point to America\u2019s lopsided trade numbers \u2014 year after year of huge deficits \u2014 as proof of foreigners\u2019 perfidy. He\u2019s seeking to restore justice and millions of long-gone U.S. factory jobs by taxing imports at rates not seen in America since the days of the horse and buggy.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve taken so much of our wealth away from us,\u201d the president declared last week at a White House Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the tariffs announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen. We truly can be very wealthy. We can be so much wealthier than any country.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the U.S. is already the wealthiest major economy in the world. And the International Monetary Fund in January forecast that the United States would outgrow every other major advanced economy this year.",
      "China and India did grow faster than the United States over the past decade, but their living standards still don\u2019t come close to those in the U.S.",
      "Manufacturing in the U.S. has been fading for decades. There is widespread agreement that many American manufacturers couldn\u2019t compete with an influx of cheap imports after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Factories closed, workers were laid off and heartland communities withered.",
      "Four years later, nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs had been lost, though robots and other forms of automation probably did at least as much to reduce factory jobs as the \u201cChina shock.\u2019\u2019",
      "To turn around this long decline, Trump has repeatedly unsheathed the tariffs that are his weapon of choice. Since returning to the White House in January, he\u2019s plastered 25% taxes on foreign cars, steel and aluminum. He\u2019s hit Chinese imports with 20% levies, on top of hefty tariffs he imposed on China during his first term.",
      "On April 2, he blasted his big bazooka: 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tariffs on just about everybody and \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs on everyone else that the Trump team identified as bad actors, including tiny Lesotho (a 50% import tax) and China (34% before adding earlier levies).",
      "Trump views tariffs as an all-purpose economic fix that will protect American industries, encourage companies to open factories in America, raise money for the U.S. Treasury and give him leverage to bend other countries to his will, even on issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as drug trafficking and immigration.",
      "The president also sees a smoking gun: The United States has bought more from other countries than it has sold them every year for the past half-century. In 2024, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services came to a whopping $918 billion, the second-highest amount on record.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro calls America\u2019s trade deficits \u201cthe sum of all cheating\u2019\u2019 by other countries.",
      "However, economists say trade deficits aren\u2019t a sign of national weakness. The U.S. economy has nearly quadrupled in size, adjusted for inflation, during that half-century of trade deficits.",
      "\u201cThere is no reason to think that a bigger trade deficit means lower growth,\" said former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics and an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is closer to the truth in many countries.\"",
      "A trade deficit, Obstfeld said, does not mean a country is losing through trade or being \"ripped off.\"",
      "The faster the U.S. economy grows, in fact, the more imports Americans tend to buy and the wider the trade deficit tends to get. The U.S. trade deficit \u2014 the gap between what it sells and what it buys from foreign countries \u2014 hit a record $945 billion in 2022 as the American economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Trade deficits typically fall sharply in recessions.",
      "Nor are trade deficits primarily inflicted on America by other countries\u2019 unfair trading practices. To economists, they\u2019re a homegrown product, the result of Americans' propensity to save little and consume more than they produce.",
      "American shoppers' famous appetite for spending more than the country makes means that a chunk of the spending is used for imports. If the United States boosted its saving \u2014 for example, by reducing its budget deficits \u2014 then that would reduce its trade deficit as well, economists say.",
      "\u201cIt's not like the rest of the world has been ripping us off for decades,\u201d said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt's because we don't save enough.\u201d",
      "The flip side of America\u2019s low savings and big trade deficits is a steady inflow of foreign investment as other countries sink their export earnings into the United States. Direct foreign investment into the U.S. came to $349 billion in 2023, the World Bank reported, nearly double No. 2 Singapore\u2019s inflows.",
      "The only scenario in which tariffs reduce the U.S. deficit is if they cause investment in the U.S. to crash, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. That \"would be a disaster.\u2019\u2019",
      "Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik said a \u201cwell-designed industrial policy\u201d supported by select tariffs \"might have fostered increased investment and capacity in manufacturing.\"",
      "Instead, Rodrik said, Trump\u2019s actions just \u201cthrow up a lot of uncertainty\u201d and alienate America\u2019s best allies, making for \"a terrible policy all in all.\u2019\u2019",

      "BANGKOK -- Asian and European shares slid on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariff hikes took effect and he threatened to add still more.",
      "Uncertainty is running high about what Trump will do next in his trade war. In a speech Tuesday night he said plans tariffs on pharmaceuticals so that more medications would be made in the U.S.",
      "Trump's latest tariffs include a massive 104% levy on U.S. imports of Chinese products. However, Chinese markets reversed early losses and gained ground on Wednesday.",
      "Driving the gains were massive share buybacks by big state-run investment funds and other state companies that often are instructed to support the market in times of crisis. Investors also are expecting the government to step up spending and other measures to help counter the impact of the tariffs, which will hit small manufacturers and traders that create the most jobs the hardest.",

      "Elsewhere, markets remained gloomy. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 3.9% lower, at 31,714.03 and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba convened a meeting of top financial ministers to reiterate his call for them to do what they can to mitigate the damage from tariffs to Japanese automakers and other manufacturers.",

      "On Tuesday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.6% after wiping out an early gain of 4.1%. That took it nearly 19% below its record set in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.1%.",
      "Stocks had rallied globally on Tuesday, with indexes up 6% in Tokyo, 2.5% in Paris and 1.6% in Shanghai. Any optimism or buying enthusiasm appeared to have dissipated by the time the sharply higher tariffs became reality.",
      "Analysts say the markets will have more swings up and down given uncertainty over how long Trump will keep the stiff tariffs on imports, which will raise prices for U.S. shoppers and slow the economy. If they persist, economists and investors expect them to cause a recession. If Trump lowers them through negotiations relatively quickly, the worst-case scenario might be avoided.",
      "Hope still remains on Wall Street that negotiations may be possible, which helped drive the morning\u2019s rally. Trump said Tuesday that a conversation with South Korea\u2019s acting president helped them reach the \u201cconfines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war is an attack on the globalization that\u2019s shaped the world\u2019s economy and helped bring down prices for products on store shelves but also caused manufacturing jobs to leave for other countries. Trump has said he wants to narrow trade deficits, which measure how much more the United States imports from other countries than it sends to them as exports.",

      "The International Monetary Fund has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout package, providing a reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country\u2019s old economic order",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country's old economic order.",
      "As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF\u2019s executive board. The board will convene in the coming days, the IMF statement said.",
      "The fund's long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina's troubled economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts. The country has received more IMF bailouts than any other.",
      "It came at a critical moment for South America's second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina\u2019s rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and burned through its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.",
      "Fears grew that if the government failed to secure an IMF loan, hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.",
      "The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina's strict foreign exchange controls, which could help convince markets of his program's sustainability. For the past six years, the capital restrictions have dissuaded investment, preventing companies from sending profits abroad and ensuring the central bank's careful management the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.",
      "Racking up 22 IMF loans since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds have been used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a fraught reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country's historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.",
      "The IMF was wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor. But over the past 16 months, fund officials have praised Milei's austerity \u2014 a diet harsher than even the fund's typical prescription.",
      "A former TV personality and self-proclaimed \u201c anarcho-capitalist,\u201d Milei came to power on a vow to shrink Argentina's bloated bureaucracy, kill spiraling inflation, open the economy to international markets and woo foreign investors after years of isolation.",
      "Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has taken his chainsaw to the state, firing tens of thousands of state employees, dissolving or downgrading a dozen ministries, gutting the education sector, cutting inflation adjustments for pensions, freezing public works projects, lifting price controls and slashing subsidies.",
      "Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina's rosy macroeconomic indicators. Retirees have been protesting weekly against low pensions, with the decrease in payments accounting for the largest share of Milei\u2019s budget cuts. Major labor unions announced a 36-hour general strike starting Wednesday in solidarity.",
      "Still, Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, a surprise that analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation, which dropped to 118% from 211% annually during his first year in office. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent the local stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.",
      "\u201cThe agreement builds on the authorities\u2019 impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation,\u201d the IMF said in announcing the agreement under a 48-month arrangement. \u201cThe program supports the next phase of Argentina\u2019s homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.\"",
      "It remained unclear how much money Argentina would receive up-front \u2014 a key sticking point in the most recent negotiations over the deal's details. Argentina is seeking a hefty payment upfront to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.",
      "Milei shared the IMF statement on social media platform X, attaching a photo that showed him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. \u201cVavos!\u201d he wrote \u2014 apparently misspelling \u201cVamos!\u201d or \u201cLet's go!\u201d in his excitement.",

      "The latest leak in the Keystone oil pipeline in North Dakota on Tuesday continues the troubled history of the 15-year-old pipeline.",
      "The 2,700-mile-long (4,350-kilometer-long) pipeline originates in Alberta, Canada, and carries heavy tar sands crude oil south across the Dakotas and Nebraska before splitting to carry oil both to refineries in Illinois and south to Oklahoma and Texas.",
      "The Keystone Pipeline was constructed in 2010 at a cost of $5.2 billion. It was built by TC Energy, but it is now operated by South Bow as of 2024.",
      "There have been 23 spills along the Keystone oil pipeline, including four in North Dakota.",
      "One leak in 2022 in Kansas was the largest onshore oil spill in nine years. That rupture in the pipeline dumped about 14,000 barrels of crude oil into a creek running through rural pastureland in Washington County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.",
      "The leaks have varied in size, but in total the Keystone pipeline has spilled more than 1 million gallons of crude oil over the years.",
      "South Bow estimated that 3,500 barrels spilled in this latest leak in North Dakota.",
      "The Pipeline Safety Trust advocacy group said that a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that preventable construction issues contributed to more spills on the Keystone pipeline than on similar pipelines. The report also said that the pipeline's largest spills were \u201ccaused by issues related to the original design, manufacturing of the pipe, or construction of the pipeline.\u201d",
      "One example of that is the Kansas leak. The Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration determined that leak was caused due to the rupture of a weld that came from a fabrication facility.",
      "\u201cKeystone\u2019s incident history illustrates the problematic pipeline\u2019s systemic issues,\u201d Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said.",
      "When the original Keystone pipeline was proposed and built there was little controversy about the project, but it was a different story a few years later when TC Energy proposed building a second pipeline called the Keystone XL pipeline.",
      "That pipeline drew years of protests from environmental activists and landowners who worried that a spill could foul their land and water. Keystone XL was ultimately abandoned by the company in 2021 after President Joe Biden refused to approve a permit for it. President Donald Trump had tried to revive it during his first term, but Biden's decision ultimately killed the project.",
      "Climate change activists viewed the expansion of oil sands development as an environmental disaster that could speed up global warming as the fuel is burned. That turned Keystone into a flashpoint in the climate debate, and it became the focus of rallies and protests in Washington, D.C., and other cities.",

      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The three Americans convicted of participating in a botched coup attempt in Congo last year have been repatriated to the United States, days after their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, Congo's presidency said Tuesday.",
      "The three will serve out their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama said. The presidency said the Americans left Congo Tuesday morning.",
      "The State Department said it was aware of their transfer into U.S. custody and referred questions to the Department of Justice. A DOJ spokesperson said they did not immediately have information to share.",
      "The conditions of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear. But international law experts said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will shorten their sentences.",
      "Among the three Americans was 21-year-old Marcel Malanga, son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the foiled coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who live-streamed from the palace during the attempt, was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Marcel Malanga has said his father forced him to take part.",
      "Also repatriated were Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, a friend of the younger Malanga who flew to Africa from Utah for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.",
      "The repatriation came amid efforts by Congolese authorities to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. in exchange for security support that will help the capital city of Kinshasa fight rebels in the country\u2019s conflict-hit east.",

Thompson\u2019s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told the AP that they didn\u2019t have all the details \u201cbut we\u2019re so excited to have him on American soil again.\u201d The Thompsons said they were grateful for all the support they received from the U.S. government, family and friends.",
      "Thompson\u2019s lawyer Skye Lazaro said Tuesday that she had limited information on what his status will be once he lands stateside. She said she plans to pursue all available legal avenues relating to his detention in the U.S.",

      "Tourism Economics expects some of the steepest declines will be from Canada, where Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the country should become the 51st state and tariffs on close trading partners have angered residents.

      "Jahn said bookings have dropped between 20% and 50%, depending on the source market, over the last eight to 10 weeks. He notes particular declines from Scandinavia, where Trump\u2019s repeated threat to take control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO ally Denmark, has antagonized citizens.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is not perceived as a welcoming destination,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "Beyond, a revenue management platform for vacation rental owners, said Canadian searches for short-term rentals in the U.S. plunged 44% after Feb. 1, when Trump first announced a since-paused 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Florida, Texas and New York were among the hardest-hit markets, Beyond said.",
      "American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the U.S. that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said Richard Groesz, the company\u2019s director of contracting. But bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind a far-right political party in that country\u2019s federal election, Groesz said.",
      "There are other issues impacting foreign visits. The U.S. has been the top destination by country for Japanese tourists for years, but data compiled by JTB Tourism Research & Consulting showed South Korea topped the U.S. in January.",
      "The weak yen \u2013 not Trump \u2013 is likely the biggest factor dampening the attraction of the U.S., said Takaaki Mitamura, a spokesperson for Tokyo-based travel agent Veltra Corp. Travelers are picking destinations where the currency effect isn\u2019t as big, like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia, he said.",

Vancouver-born Schiller said he and his Norfolk Island-born wife are likely the only business owners on the island that will pay elevated tariffs \u2014 and they will pay at the rates imposed on Japan and India, where the goods are manufactured. Around 80% of Kooshoo\u2019s business is with the United States.",

She is a 9th generation descendant of a crewman of the British naval ship HMS Bounty who mutinied in 1789, although her mother is Canadian.

      "Harry, who made a rare appearance in court for the hearing, lost his government-funded protection in February 2020 after he stepped down from his role as a working member of the royal family and moved to the U.S.",
      "A High Court judge ruled last year that a government panel\u2019s decision to provide \u201cbespoke\u201d security for Harry on an as-needed basis was not unlawful, irrational or unjustified.",
      "But attorney Shaheed Fatima argued that a group that evaluated the Duke of Sussex\u2019s security needs failed to follow its own process and perform a risk management assessment.",
      "\u201cThe appellant does not accept that bespoke means better,\u201d Fatima said. \u201cIn fact, in his submission, it means that he has been singled out for different, unjustified and inferior treatment.\u201d",
      "Harry, whose titles include the Duke of Sussex, was wearing a navy blue suit and light blue tie as he sat behind his lawyer. His surprise appearance was an indication of the case's importance to him.",
      "Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, has bucked royal family convention by taking the government and tabloid press to court, where he has a mixed record.",
      "But Harry rarely shows up to court, making only a few appearances in the past two years. That included the trial of one of his phone hacking cases against the British tabloids when he was the first senior member of the royal family to enter the witness box in more than a century.",
      "Harry had claimed he and his family are endangered when visiting his homeland because of hostility aimed at him and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on social media and through relentless hounding by news media.",
      "He lost a related court case in which he sought permission to privately pay for a police detail when in the U.K. but a judge denied that offer after a government lawyer argued officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "He also dropped a libel case against the publisher of the Daily Mail for an article that said he had tried to hide his efforts to continue receiving government-funded security.",
      "But he won a significant victory at trial in 2023 against the publisher of the Daily Mirror when a judge found that phone hacking at the tabloid was \u201cwidespread and habitual.\u201d He claimed a \u201cmonumental\u201d victory in January when Rupert Murdoch\u2019s U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.",
      "He has a similar case pending against the publisher of the Mail.",

      "Many parents need child care scholarships to work",
      "PHOENIX -- For parents who need to work but can't afford the steep cost of child care, federally funded scholarships can be a lifeline. Delivered through state child care assistance programs, the scholarships can mean the difference between a parent working full time \u2014 or not at all.",
      "But qualified families increasingly are being turned away, thanks to the rising costs of child care and the end of pandemic-era funds, and some families that had scholarships have seen them end. In at least three states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado and Texas \u2014 parents who apply face long waitlists. Other states, including Nevada and Oklahoma, have increased copayments for parents or have said they will serve fewer children. In Idaho, enrollment was paused for part of last year.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration laid off some employees who helped states implement child care assistance. It's all left advocates worried about the future of federal child care programs.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that ultimately child care will become less safe, it\u2019s going to become more expensive, and it\u2019s going to become harder to find,\u201d said Ruth Friedman, who was the director of the Office of Child Care under former President Joe Biden.",
      "As part of Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal government, the administration eliminated jobs in the Office of Child Care, which oversees federal child care subsidies and ensure states are enforcing safety standards.",
      "All staff in five of the 10 regional offices were cut, along with more in the office\u2019s headquarters in Washington. They included staff who upheld federal safety requirements for child care providers and ensured subsidies were being used effectively. They worked with states to enforce requirements to run background checks on child care employees. They also safeguarded programs from waste and fraud.",
      "During the pandemic, Congress approved record spending to boost the child care industry, recognizing its importance to restarting the economy. States received $24 billion to help child care providers boost wages, buy masks and air purifiers and train staff, plus an extra $15 billion for child care assistance scholarships.",
      "That money expired in September. Congress declined to extend it, despite a push from Biden and child care advocates. Since then, some states have attempted to continue programs with their own taxpayers' money. But many, such as Arizona, have ended special pandemic-era programs, like those that helped teachers pay for child care. Now, Arizona parents who apply for basic child care assistance are put on waitlists \u2014 with no clear end in sight.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a much bigger need than there are funds,\u201d said Kim Kofron of the Texas-based advocacy group Children at Risk. \u201cWe know all of these families are willing to work.\u201d",
      "In Phoenix, child care worker Janeth Ibarra would have paid nothing last year for care for her twin boys, because she would have received a special scholarship for those in her field. This year, her income qualifies her for regular state child care assistance. But because the state ran low on money for the program, she was on a waitlist earlier this year.",
      "As it stands, Ibarra, 22, earns $16.50 an hour and is paying more than $1,200 a month for child care, after a steep discount from her employer.",
      "\u201cEven with overtime, it\u2019s barely survivable,\u201d Ibarra said. At the end of last year, Ibarra had to spend the last of her savings on special formula for one of her sons, a purchase not covered by her food assistance benefits. She tried to breastfeed more to save money.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers in 2023 rejected pandemic aid for child care, the state stopped accepting applications for its child care assistance program. When the applications resumed, the state tightened income restrictions. Now, the only families who qualify earn less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or $41,795 for a family of four. Before, a family of four could earn up to $56,000 and still receive a scholarship.",
      "In Colorado, a dozen counties stopped accepting new applications for the state's child care assistance program because they ran out of money, The Colorado Sun reported.",
      "Trump has been vague on his plans to make child care more affordable. He said during his campaign that he believed tariffs would rake in \u201ctrillions of dollars.\u201d Child care, he added, is, \u201crelatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we\u2019ll be taking in.\u201d",
      "Economists, though, have warned tariffs could cause prices for other household goods to skyrocket, squeezing family budgets, and it\u2019s unlikely there would be much money left over for the government to spend if Trump successfully implements steep tax cuts. Advocates are concerned child care funding could be cut as the president seeks to shrink the federal government.",
      "For states trying to maintain child care assistance scholarships, the costs of running the programs have risen. Because many child care providers operate in the margins, the Biden administration increased the amount they receive when they take scholarship students.",
      "It's all evidence the problems that vex the child care industry have not necessarily abated with the pandemic, said Karen Schulman, senior director of child care policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.",
      "\u201cThe crisis was going on long before COVID,\u201d Schulman said, citing the unaffordability of care for many families, along with the low pay of the child care workforce.",
      "Even as providers struggle to make a profit, child care is prohibitively expensive for many families. In a study of 2022 child care prices, the Labor Department found the median cost of care for an infant in a center was more than $15,600 in large counties \u2014 higher than the median rent in many places.",
      "When Brooklyn Newman divorced her husband, she moved with her two boys, now 2 and 4, into a trailer while she got back on her feet. The Phoenix mother was eager to send her older boy to preschool so he could have structure as the family weathered the split. But she could not afford tuition for her younger son until the preschool gave her a scholarship funded by pandemic aid.",
      "With both boys in school half-time, Newman could put in more hours at her job as a freelance business analyst. But when the scholarship ended, she had to pay out of pocket \u2014 adding $1,000 a month to her preschool tuition. She made a painful trade-off: She juggled working in the evening while watching her children at home \u2014 sacrificing quality time with them so she can earn enough money to continue to send them to preschool.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m constantly behind a computer, you know, giving everything I can,\u201d Brooklyn said earlier this year, her voice tightening with emotion. Occasionally, her sons will hide her computer mouse to keep her from working.",
      "But she can see growth from their time in preschool \u2014 in their language, in their confidence, in their relationships with teachers and classmates. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them grow. It\u2019s just the best feeling. And that\u2019s why I do everything I can to have them there.\u201d",

      "PANAMA CITY -- Panama\u2019s comptroller authority said Monday an audit found irregularities in the renewal of a 25-year port concession in the interoceanic canal and it would request an investigation into the authorization of the contract to a Hong Kong company.",
      "Comptroller-General Anel Flores said the audit found some payment defaults, accounting miscalculations and some \u201cshadow\u201d operation of companies that the Hong Kong company originally denied, causing Panama around $300 million in lost revenue.",
      "The release of the audit of Panama Ports Company, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate subsidiary that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration alleges Chinese interference in the canal's operations, which Panamanian authorities have denied. It also happens the same day the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives to the Central American country to participate in a subregional security conference.",
      "\u201cThere are many violations that will have to be explained,\u201d the Panamanian comptroller said.",
      "He added that the audit\u2019s results will be sent to Panama\u2019s Maritime Authority, which oversees the ports and has the power to terminate a contract.",
      "Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings conglomerate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Panama Ports Company won a concession in 1997 to operate the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and it was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years.",
      "Trump has threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians more than two decades ago.",
      "Some days ago, while the audit was underway, CK Hutchison said it has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control.",
      "The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group\u2019 operations of the ports did not mean a Chinese control over the canal.",

For him and those Mavericks fans who cheered him while he wore that number in Mavericks blue the first 5 1/2 seasons of his career.",
      "Two months after that seismic trade out of nowhere that sent the five-time All-Star to the Lakers, the 26-year-old Doncic is back in Dallas for a game Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know about closure. It\u2019s obviously a lot,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI know the fans are going to appreciate me being back here. Honestly, I don't know how I\u2019m going to feel, but I\u2019m just excited to be back.\u201d",
      "Several hours before the sold-out game, tickets on the secondary market for upper-level seats were running at $230 and more, excluding fees. For the next Mavericks home game Friday night against Toronto, similar tickets were available for less than $20 before fees.",
      "Doncic had been the face of the Mavericks, and he was the NBA scoring champion last season when they made it to the NBA Finals. The 2019 rookie of the year from Slovenia had two seasons left on his contract when general manager Nico Harrison traded him the first weekend of February in a package that brought Anthony Davis to Dallas.",

There have been protests and plenty of ire directed at Harrison, including \u201cFire Nico!\u201d showing up on plenty of signs and T-shirts. As for the GM, he hasn't spoken to the media since comments he made right after the deal was done when he said he felt the team was \u201cbuilt to win now as well as in the future.\u201d",

      "The Mavericks went into the reunion with Doncic sitting in 10th place in the Western Conference, the final spot to get into next week's play-in tournament.",
      "Dallas was 12-18 since the trade. Davis had played in only seven of those games (five wins). The 10-time All-Star missed six weeks after his dominant debut with the Mavs on Feb. 8, when he had 26 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks against Houston before coming up lame in the third quarter because of a groin injury.",
      "Los Angeles, which was third in the West with four teams only a game behind them, was 20-12 since Doncic joined LeBron James' team. The Lakers were 16-9 in the games Doncic played, including Tuesday night when he got ejected at Oklahoma City.",
      "This isn't the first time Doncic played the Mavericks. He had a triple double (19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists) in the Lakers' 107-99 home win on Feb. 25, only 23 days after the trade.",
      "After that game, Doncic struggled for the words to express how strange it was to play against the Mavs.",
      "\u201cIt was so weird,\" Doncic said then. \"There were moments I felt like I don\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think the timing for this class with expansion and the increased value in franchises and in the growth of the game will bring another level of incredible play from these players that have already been on a stage similar,\u201d Antonelli said.",
      "Five teams in the league don't even have first round picks: New York, Indiana, Phoenix and Atlanta all traded away their picks. Las Vegas forfeited its pick following an investigation by the league in 2023 that found the franchise violated league rules regarding impermissible player benefits and workplace policies.",
      "Washington has three picks in the first round and Connecticut has two. Both teams are rebuilding and players could find a lot of available minutes there. There's also the expansion Golden State franchise that should have a lot of open spots, too.",
      "Here are some players to keep an eye on that could dictate how the draft unfolds once Dallas makes Bueckers the expected No. 1 player selected:",
      "Malonga isn't the only player in the draft who has honed her skills in France. Juste Jocyte, Malonga's Lyon teammate in the French basketball league, is also expected to be taken in the first round.",
      "If Seattle takes her second, she'll be paired with an already strong frontcourt alongside Ezi Magbegor and Nneka Ogwumike, which could give the Storm a formidable front line.",
      "Jocyte is a versatile player who can play any of the guard positions and is really effective in the pick and roll. The Lithuanian, who is also 19 years old, scored 22 points against Belgium in EuroBasket qualifying a few months ago. She has a toughness about her and is fundamentally sound.",
      "\u201cShe's left-handed and knows how to play with or without the ball in her hands,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cNot a true point guard, but can handle the ball. She's a smart player who knows how to use screens.\u201d",
      "Aneesah Morrow has a nose for the ball with a desire to go get it.",
      "She is just 6-1, but led the nation in double-doubles, averaging 18.7 points and 13.5 rebounds a game with LSU to finish second all-time behind Courtney Paris in that category. She is able to grab boards over much taller opponents and just has a knack for rebounding. She shot 49% from the field, but most of her shots came from close to the basket. She'll need to increase her range.",
      "Georgia Amoore and Hailey Van Lith are combo guards who can score and also distribute to teammates.",
      "Amoore averaged 19.6 points and 6.9 assists at Kentucky this season after transferring from Virginia Tech. At 5-6, she might have a more difficult time getting her shot off then she did in college.",
      "Van Lith benefitted from playing in the Olympics and winning a bronze medal with the USA Basketball 3-on-3 team last year. She averaged 17.7 points and 5.4 assists this past season to help TCU reach the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.",

      "Min Woo Lee had won just about everywhere but the PGA Tour before he triumphed at the Texas Open",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Min Woo Lee broke into the top 25 in the world following his victory a couple weeks ago at the Houston Open, the long-awaited first on the PGA Tour for the big-hitting Australian who had won just about everywhere else around the world.",
      "Jason Day thinks his fellow Aussie can climb even higher.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all up to him if he wants to get to No. 1,\u201d said Day, who spent 51 weeks there starting in September 2015. \"It\u2019s a lifestyle change he has to understand. I know that he has the tools and the mental side to do it because he loves the moment, and that\u2019s something you cannot teach golfers in general, to love being in that moment and under the most stress.",
      "\u201cIf he can really enjoy that and just improve over time, he\u2019ll be probably be our next No. 1,\u201d Day added. \"I\u2019m going to take myself out of the conversation because that\u2019s my goal as well. But he\u2019s got the best chance to become No. 1 from Australia.\"",
      "Greg Norman spent 331 weeks at No. 1 in the 1980s and '90s. Adam Scott spent 11 weeks there in 2014.",
      "\u201cI always felt like I had the assets to win, it was just can you do it mentally?\u201d said Lee, who acknowledged that Day had helped in that regard \u2014 credit that Day in turn passed along to Karrie Webb, one of Australia's greatest players.",
      "She had also passed along some advice to the 26-year-old Lee, who heads into this week's Masters having made the cut in two of his previous three appearances at Augusta National, including a tie for 22nd last year.",
      "\u201cI wanted him to hear, \u2018Hey, this is what she did. This is what I did. A lot of these other guys did,\u2019\u201d Day explained. \u201cWhen you want to be No. 1, everything has to be in order. Certain sacrifices need to happen. ... There is only a certain amount of people that can sit on that perch. It\u2019s nice to look back and say, 'I accomplished that.'\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland is a naturally inquisitive fella, which comes in handy when it comes to golf. The 27-year-old from Norway likes to tinker with things, which is how he came to have a new driver in the bag for the Masters this week.",
      "It's also how he wound up last week on the \u201cUAP Files Podcast\u201d \u2014 as in, unidentified anomalous phenomena.",
      "UFOs, in common parlance. Extraterrestrials. Space aliens.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just interesting when you have an open mind,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cEven in the golf swing, you can get very dogmatic and you look at things as, \u2018Oh, this has to be a truth. This has to be correct.\u2019 And sometimes the beliefs that you hold the most deeply can obfuscate yourself. When you question things and look at things from different angles, you might get to a deeper truth.\"",
      "Sure, Hovland says, there are moments when he thinks, \"OK, I know this is getting into territory that's very speculative.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think as long as you have an objective kind of mindset while looking into this information, I think it\u2019s just fun,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cYou don't have to live and die by every word you read or thing you hear.\u201d",
      "Augusta National doesn't see a need to update its criteria to create a special category for LIV Golf players. Chairman Fred Ridley said that can be handled through special invitations, which is what Joaquin Niemann received each of the last two years.",
      "U.S. Open and British Open organizers this year are exempting the leading player from the LIV Golf League points list.",
      "\u201cWe feel we can deal with that issue \u2014 whether it\u2019s a LIV player or a player on some other tour that might not otherwise be eligible for an invitation \u2014 that we can handle that with a special invitation,\" Ridley said.",
      "PGA Tour winners (that offer full FedEx Cup points) get automatic invitations. The LIV Golf players who won 54-hole tournaments since last year's Masters who are not at Augusta National this week are Brendan Steele, Carlos Ortiz, Adrian Meronk and Marc Leishman, who won last week at Doral.",
      "All eight of the PGA Tour winners in the fall, where most fields were weak because they were primarily players trying to keep their tour cards, received invitations. That list includes Kevin Yu, Rafael Campos and Matt McCarty.",
      "Key to the Masters is keeping the field under 100 players. The field is at 95 this year.",
      "\u201cWe will have a thorough examination of our qualifications after the tournament this year, and we may make some changes,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cNot necessarily that, but some years we do make changes, some years we don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He also said the Masters would study whether winners of strong European tour events, such as the BMW PGA Championship and Hero Dubai Desert Classic, should get an exemption.",
      "Justin Thomas will have Joe Greiner on his bag this week, making the change Tuesday night after his usual caddie, Matt \u201cRev\u201d Minister, hurt his back. Greiner had recently split with Max Homa, his longtime partner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very lucky Joe Greiner is a great friend and able to help me out last minute,\u201d Thomas said on social media.",
      "Greiner helped Homa tie for third at Augusta National last year. But the six-time PGA Tour winner has slumped badly since, and Greiner decided it would be best to split with his childhood friend ahead of last week\u2019s Texas Open.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard. I\u2019m just so used to him caddying,\u201d said Homa, who now has Bill Harke on his bag. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to process, but also good in a way, because friendship does matter more than any of this stuff.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers are wrapping up their first homestand with a subtle change on the field at Comerica Park, putting grass over a strip of dirt that used to be between the pitcher's mound and batter's box.",
      "AL Cy Young and Triple Crown winner Tarik Skubal said he\u2019s glad the team got rid of the keyhole, making the lefty\u2019s sightline the same as it is in every other ballpark in Major League Baseball.",
      "\u201cI might get some heat for this, but they asked what we thought of it, and I said I didn\u2019t really like it,\u201d Skubal said Wednesday morning before a series-ending game against the New York Yankees. \"I wasn\u2019t a fan of it.",
      "\u201cObviously, I understand from a fan perspective. It\u2019s unique and stuff, but just from a visual perspective, it\u2019s so much different.\u201d",
      "Detroit was the last team in the majors to have the throwback feature \u2014 which was common in the 1800s and early 1900s \u2014 in their ballpark that opened in 2000 after leaving Tiger Stadium. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had a keyhole at Chase Field before removing it in 2019 when they changed their playing surface from grass to synthetic turf.",
      "The Tigers also made major renovations in the seating area behind home plate, removing a tunnel that was mostly used by umpires and installing state-of-the-art chairs that allow fans to heat or cool their seats.",
      "\u201cI'm a fan of having no tunnel,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cI'm glad it's gone. It makes it feel pretty clean back there.\u201d",
      "While Skubal said the front office asked for his input following the 2024 season and he gave his strong opinion, two other pitchers on the staff simply shrugged their shoulders when asked about the new-look view and an All-Star outfielder insisted he didn't even realize the keyhole was gone.",
      "\u201cThey asked a couple guys, but it didn't bother me,\u201d right-handed reliever Will Vest said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t really move the needle too much for me.\u201d",
      "When lefty Tyler Holton is on the mound, he said he's locked in on the catcher's target with or without a path of dirt in front of him.",
      "\u201cI think if you\u2019re noticing things like that, you\u2019re probably not focused on what you need to be focused on,\u201d Holton said.",
      "Riley Greene, meanwhile, insisted he didn't know the keyhole was gone until a reporter asked him about it on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I didn't even notice it,\u201d Greene said. \u201cSomebody told me that it was being taken out and I was like, `Oh, cool. I\u2019m probably not even going to notice it.' And, I haven\u2019t even noticed it.\u201d",

      "This week they\u2019ll both have a chance to fulfill that childhood dream \u2014 all while making Masters history.",
      "The Danish duo will become the first set of twins ever to play in the Masters together. There have been 18 sets of brothers who\u2019ve played here together, most recently Italy\u2019s Eduardo and Francesco Molinari from 2010-2012, but none have been twins.",
      "\u201cI think we really started watching the Masters when we were about 10, 11 years old,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cSo 2012 when Bubba (Watson) won was probably the first real memory we have of the place. Yeah, it\u2019s nice to be here now.\u201d",
      "This is Nicolai's second Masters.",
      "He actually led last year's tournament for 10 holes in the third round, only to fall out of contention after shooting 74 and 76 on the weekend. He finished tied for 16th. It was Nicolai's best finish in nine majors, but not enough to earn an automatic bid to this year's tournament since only the top 12 are guaranteed a spot. He received a special invitation to play the Masters this year.",
      "Rasmus is making his first Masters appearance, earning his way in after finishing in the top 50 in the world rankings last year. This will be his seventh major.",
      "On Sunday, the 24-year-old twins toured the historic course together and Nicolai pointed out some tips to his slightly younger brother on how to navigate one of golf's toughest challenges this week since Rasmus has never played here. That preceded a joint news conference on Tuesday, where they inadvertently wound up \u201ctwinning\u201d after showing up in similar outfits.",
      "\u201cCompletely random,\u201d Nicolai joked.",
      "The twins would be nearly indecipherable if not for Rasmus' slightly longer hair.",
      "There have been other twins in golf, but none quite as accomplished as the Hojgaards. Rasmus ranks 55th in the world and has won five times on the European Tour, two more than his brother. Nicolai ranks 82nd and was a member of the winning European Ryder Cup team in 2023.",
      "They won\u2019t be playing in the same group at the Masters on Thursday, however.",
      "Nicolai will be in the second threesome on the course, while Rasmus tees off in the afternoon.",
      "There was a time that might have been a good thing. Growing up, the twins were extremely competitive on the course and didn't always get along. When one brother beat the other they would often go days without speaking to one another.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we supported each other very much back then,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cWe would fight a lot more than saying congratulations.\u201d",
      "There are no regrets, though.",
      "Nicolai said that fierce sibling rivalry helped shape and drive them to get to where they are today.",
      "\"That helped a certain amount, really wanting to beat each other and that competitive edge we both have,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "Times have since changed somewhat, though.",
      "The twins have matured and are now big supporters of each other's game and the successes that have come along with it. They can often be seen practicing together and helping each other as much as possible when their games veer off course.",
      "\u201cWe got older and we can shake each other\u2019s hand now and say congrats when someone is playing well \u2014 and be brothers as well and friends at the same time,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "But the competitiveness will always be there.",
      "So what happens if the other brother knocks off defending champion Scottie Scheffler and gets to wear the green jacket on Sunday?",
      "\u201cProbably be very frustrating,\u201d Rasmus said with a long laugh. \u201cNo, I think it would be very cool. It would be very cool. If something like that happens, I think we\u2019ll deal with it at the time, but I think it\u2019s hard to sit here and try and explain what that would feel like.\"",

      "Augusta National looks as pristine as ever on the eve of the Masters",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The patrons walking up the first fairway at Augusta National during a sun-splashed practice round for the Masters managed to find a nice viewpoint between a couple of pines, where they watched as Justin Rose hit an approach shot to the green.",
      "There are quite a few more places for them to perch after Hurricane Helen tore through Georgia last summer.",
      "By the time the deadly Category 4 storm churned north and finally dissipated, it left in its wake an estimated 1 million downed trees, thousands without power, and some 7 million cubic yards of debris to pick up. The city of Augusta was devastated, and the pristine property that annually hosts golf's most revered tournament was left with its own massive clean-up effort.",
      "Nearly six months later, it's hard to tell anything was ever amiss. The fairways and greens are perfectly manicured, the azaleas once again in bloom. All that are missing are the hundreds of trees that failed to survive the storm.",
      "\u201cIt almost felt like I was playing the back nine for the first time,\u201d two-time major winner Xander Schauffele said. \u201cThere's trees you aim at off the tee, and over the 11th green you can \u2014 when you're walking down 10, you can see half the course.\u201d",
      "That sweeping vista left Schauffele with mixed feelings. In some respects, it was neat to see what was happening elsewhere on the property, thanks to panoramic views that are probably a lot like what Alister MacKenzie and Bobby Jones would have had as they plotted the layout on a former nursery and antebellum plantation in the early 1930s.",
      "In other respects, Schauffele said, \u201cit's sad to see, too, how many trees have fallen.\u201d",
      "The missing trees should not demonstrably affect the way the course plays when the Masters begins Thursday. Some of those towering pines served as convenient aiming points \u2014 over the 11th green, for example \u2014 but markers that are just as helpful. And the most wayward shots will still be penalized by trunks and limbs among the pine straw.",
      "\u201cWhen you're hitting into the trees,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said, \u201cyou're still going to be in a good amount of trouble.\u201d",
      "The more interesting discussion seems to center on whether the loss of so many trees was an unintended positive.",
      "John Fought played in the Masters three times in the 1970s and \u201880s before his second career as a lauded golf course architect behind such well-known layouts as Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon. He's among many who have embraced the removal of unnecessary trees at such classic courses as Oakmont, and restoring them to the what their original designers intended.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion the course has undergone a lot of change. Not just in length \u2014 which is obvious \u2014 but also in its tree planting,\u201d Fought said, pointing specifically to trees down the right of No. 11 and behind Nos. 15 and 17. \u201cSome of this tree planting has been good, but overall it has changed the course markedly from the course Bobby Jones and Alister Mackenzie envisioned.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Jones and MacKenzie often said that St. Andrews served as an inspiration for Augusta National. It is evident in the large, undulating greens, the absence of penal rough, and the risk-reward opportunities that exist across the course.",
      "There are no towering pines on the windswept Scottish coast, though.",
      "\u201cSt. Andrews is wide open with many angles to play from. I would like to see more of that,\" Fought said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love the Masters and how it is run, but I have observed that trees have become a dominating force in the design.\u201d",
      "Much of that has been by necessity.",
      "One way to combat advancements in technology, and force players to hit similar shots to those of decades ago, has been to lengthen the course. But another has been to tighten it. When the club transplanted 36 pines in 2003, then-Masters chairman Hootie Johnson said the impetus was to continue \u201cour long-standing emphasis on accuracy off the tee.\u201d",
      "In the late 1990s, longtime New Yorker and Golf Digest writer David Owen was asked to write a history of the club, and granted unfettered access to its vast archives. His book, \u201cThe Making of the Masters,\u201d is considered its definitive account.",
      "Owen points out that Jones \u201cdescribed the course as \u2018of national design,\u2019\u201d and he embraced changes suggested by many people. And while Mackenzie did call St. Andrews the model, \u201cyou kind of have to suspend disbelief to see real similarities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say the changes have been necessary,\u201d Owen concluded. \u201cPros today would annihilate the course as it was in 1934.\u201d",
      "How they will fare in 2025 remains to be seen.",
      "Thanks to Hurricane Helene, those walking the property this week at least will have different places to watch it.",
      "\u201cI just think it looks better. I don\u2019t know why I say that,\u201d admitted Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion. \"The other day we played No. 1 and we were standing on the green and you just look right down and you see a lot more room on the ninth tee.

      "Kris Jenkins, who made the winning shot for Villanova in the 2016 college basketball championship game, is suing the NCAA and six conferences to recoup income he contends he would have earned if athletes at the time were not barred from making money from their name, image and likeness.",
      "Jenkins is among some 350 current and former athletes who have opted out of a $2.8 billion antitrust settlement with the NCAA that's on the cusp of final approval. Some of the opt-outs have filed lawsuits to pursue lost income on their own.",
      "NCAA athletes weren't allowed to make NIL money until July 2021. The so-called House settlement would provide back pay for athletes dating back to 2016, with the amount for each generally determined by sport and how much the athlete played. Jenkins played at Villanova from 2013-17 and in his last two seasons started 72 of 76 games and averaged 13 points per game.",
      "Attorney Kevin T. Duffy Jr. of Greenwich, Connecticut, filed Jenkins' lawsuit Saturday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. It requests a jury trial and compensation for Jenkins to be determined at trial. The NCAA declined to comment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Jenkins is entitled to a share of the largesse associated with Villanova winning the national title on his buzzer-beating 3-pointer.",
      "As a result of that shot, the lawsuit says, the NCAA reportedly paid the Big East $19.1 million to distribute among its member schools; the athletic department received a $22.6 million gift, largest in program history; and the athletic program generated $11.4 million in revenue and fully funded its non-revenue sports.",
      "The lawsuit notes alumni donations increased 27% in 2016, enrollment increased and that the publicity value of winning the title was about $250 million and about $1 billion if the value of the game broadcasts were factored in.",
      "The lawsuit says because of the NCAA's restraints on athlete compensation, Jenkins was denied a share of game telecast revenue and compensation he would have received for media broadcast uses of his NIL (\u201cBNIL\u201d) as well as income he would have earned for his NIL from third parties for use in video games and other opportunities, including marketing, sponsorship, social media, branding and promotional and other NIL deals.",
      "The Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conference were named as defendants, the lawsuit said, because each participated with the NCAA in the \u201ccollusive restraint of trade and other violations of law alleged in this Complaint.\u201d",

      "Emanuel Sharp was unable to get off a 3-pointer with Walter Clayton Jr. running toward him and leaping with his left arm extended. Since the Houston guard was in the air himself, all he could do in was to let the ball fall to the floor \u2014 or get called for a travel when his feet came down.",
      "With Sharp desperately screening Clayton in hopes that one of his teammates would be able to get the loose ball and get off a shot, Condon instead dived to the floor and reached out to get it with his hands while the clock was running out.",

      "Houston trailed only 63 seconds all night, and yet fell short of its first national championship.",
      "For Florida, it was a beautiful ugly. The Gators overcame a 12-point deficit after halftime for their third national championship, in their first title game since winning back-to-back in 2006 and 2007.",
      "The Gators hadn't led since 8-6 until Alijah Martin hit two free throws with 46 seconds left to go up 64-63. That came right after Cryer was stripped underneath the Houston basket and Condon came away with the ball.",
      "Sharp also had a turnover when Will Richard had a steal with 26 seconds left that led to another free throw. Houston then called timeout with 19 seconds remaining to set up a final play.",
      "Cryer got the ball to Sharp, who had no chance to complete his jumper with Clayton charging toward him.",
      "\u201cWe had a chance to win, just didn\u2019t get a shot off,\u201d said Houston big man J\u2019Wan Roberts, who part of 149 wins while playing in five seasons since getting to Houston six years ago.",
      "When the buzzer sounded, Sharp remained crouched on the court near that spot for an extended period. He was consoled by teammate Ja\u2019Vier Francis \u2014 and Clayton, like Sharp from the Tampa Bay area.",
      "The Cougars had only nine turnovers in the entire game, but four came after Cryer\u2019s putback of his own miss with 2:29 left for a 62-60 lead.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just going through those last two possessions more than anything else. Incomprehensible in that situation we couldn\u2019t get a shot, couldn\u2019t get a shot,\u201d Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said. \u201cBut Florida was doing a good job running us off the line and forcing us to score it. We just didn\u2019t do a very good job of finishing some shots.\u201d",

      "Trump complimented \u201cthe very talented people\u201d who beat the New York Yankees in five games, while also refusing to introduce some Democratic senators at the ceremony because \u201cI just don\u2019t particularly like them, so I won\u2019t introduce (them).\u201d The event came during a manic Monday for U.S. stocks after Trump doubled down on his tariffs.",
      "Trump singled out several Dodgers for their achievements last season, praising Ohtani for becoming baseball's first 50 home run-50 stolen base player, Japanese pitcher Yoshi Yamamoto and NL Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.",
      "Trump praised Betts for his play \u2014 and took a dig at the Boston Red Sox for trading him to the Dodgers \u2014 and they shook hands at the ceremony.",
      "Betts, the star outfielder at the time for the 2018 champion Boston Red Sox, did not make that team\u2019s trip to the White House the next year during Trump's first term. Betts was on the Dodgers when they won the World Series in 2020 and attended the celebration the following year under President Joe Biden.",
      "The 32-year-old Betts is the lone Black player on the Dodgers who returned from last season\u2019s World Series team.",
      "\u201cNobody else in this clubhouse has to go through a decision like this except me,\u201d Betts said over the weekend of his decision. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it tough. But it is what it is. I\u2019m not trying to make this political by any means at all. All it is is just me being with my team to celebrate something. It\u2019s a privilege to get an invitation like this. I just want to be there with them.\u201d",
      "Manager Dave Roberts had called the invitation a huge honor that each World Series champion gets to experience. Roberts said deciding to go to the White House was not a formal conversation he and players had.",
      "The trip came almost a month after a Department of Defense webpage describing Brooklyn Dodgers great and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson\u2019s military service was restored after it had come down.",
      "That development came after pages honoring a Black Medal of Honor winner and Japanese American service members were taken down \u2014 which the Pentagon said was a mistake \u2014 amid the department\u2019s effort to remove content singling out the contributions by women and minority groups, which the Trump administration considers \u201cDEI.\u201d",
      "Neither Robinson nor any other previous Dodgers greats were mentioned at the ceremony.",
      "Trump did talk briefly about former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whom the former New Yorker called a friend. Trump also poked fun at the late Yankees owner's notorious short-leash with his managers after he congratulated Roberts.",
      "\u201cI think he would have lasted even with George Steinbrenner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou lose two games and you're fired.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Mark Walter and pitcher Clayton Kershaw gave brief remarks at the White House. Kershaw presented Trump with a Dodgers jersey and No. 47 on the back.",
      "Trump may have tipped his hand that he expected the Dodgers \u2014 who were 9-2 going into Monday night's game at Washington \u2014 to repeat as World Series champs.",
      "\u201cAfter seeing how successful you've begun the season, I can tell you that you can plan on being back here, I hope you can be back here, next year,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The NHL\u2019s reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers became the first team to visit Trump in his second term when they were honored during a ceremony in the East Room in early February.",

      "Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he\u2019ll be remembered for most was getting Houston\u2019s Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning 3 in the final seconds.",
      "Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for traveling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero.",
      "Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators (36-4) in it, and they won their third overall title and first since 2007. The Cougars (35-5) and coach Kelvin Sampson were denied their first championship.",

      "The conversation around a joint men's and women's Final Four has resurfaced",
      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Millions tuned in to watch women's basketball powerhouses UConn and South Carolina dominate in the Final Four on Friday. Many more watched Houston and Florida stun their opponents in the men's Final Four a day later.",
      "Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman sees a world where both premier events happen in the same place.",
      "It's not a new conversation, but Ackerman believes the exponential growth of women's basketball in a landscape long dominated by the men makes now an ideal time for a joint Final Four.",
      "\u201cYou will get people to say that it shouldn\u2019t happen,\" said Ackerman, who has been commissioner of the Big East since 2013. \u201cThat the women\u2019s tournament is doing just fine. And that\u2019s not without merit. I\u2019m saying if the NCAA is looking for growth \u2014 and it is \u2014 and is looking for revenue growth \u2014 and it is. I can\u2019t think of many ways you could accomplish that in a significant way versus in an incremental way than combining the two Final Fours.\"",
      "The men and women\u2019s basketball tournaments would hold their semifinals and title games in the same city on the same weekend, with similar staggered scheduling as there currently is. Though a combined Final Four likely couldn\u2019t take place until at least 2032, with sites on both sides locked in until 2031.",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker isn't opposed to the idea, which would have to be approved by a committee of NCAA, but he acknowledged there would be challenges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something they don\u2019t discuss,\" Baker said. \"They do. I think there are two big issues with it. The biggest one is just finding a place that would be able to make that whole thing work. Just logistically (it) would be challenging.\u201d",
      "Combining the tournaments was also recommended several years ago after an external review of gender disparities between the men's and women's tourneys. The scathing report was released in August 2021 by a law firm hired by the NCAA, sparked by social media and player complaints about glaring differences in amenities at the men's and women's sites.",
      "Ackerman said the idea she's been pushing for over 10 years should at least be considered. She wrote a paper for the NCAA in 2013 proposing ideas for more equity in the championships, including combining both Final Fours.",
      "With different sites, many commissioners, athletic directors and school officials find themselves having to choose which tournament to attend, Ackerman said. And because more ancillary events and sponsorship activations happen at the men's site, those officials often end up at that one instead of the women's tournament.",
      "\u201cThere's a symbolism there that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Ackerman said, \u201cwhich is, we\u2019re trying to build women\u2019s basketball. We need everybody on board to do that. We need the athletic directors here (at the women's tournament). ... We\u2019re losing that sort of spiritual support, if you will, for women\u2019s basketball because it\u2019s head to head with the men\u2019s Final Four, which is a magnet for all the networking and business activity.\u201d",
      "Ed Desser, the sports media executive who co-authored that 2021 gender equity analysis, said it makes financial sense to combine the tournaments, as it creates a central location for everyone, including NCAA staff, to operate from.",
      "\u201cSecondly, you have the opportunity, which may have seemed like a bit of a fantasy a few years back, but nowadays, the notion of filling up a dome to see the women\u2019s finals makes a lot of sense,\u201d Desser said. \u201cAnd that creates operating efficiencies and creates substantial additional revenue opportunities.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas was one of the large metropolitan areas that Ackerman said could work for a combined tournament. The city, which has the WNBA's Aces, the NFL's Raiders and the NHL's Golden Knights, has hosted the NBA Summer League \u2014 with 30 teams \u2014 since its inaugural season in 2004.",
      "There are also concerns that the women could be overshadowed by the men if the tournaments were held in the same place.",
      "John Kosner, a digital media consultant, who co-authored the gender equity report with Desser, said women's basketball's expanding reach should quell those apprehensions.",
      "Last year's women\u2019s NCAA championship game drew a bigger television audience than the men\u2019s title game for the first time, with an average of 18.9 million viewers watching undefeated South Carolina beat Iowa and superstar Caitlin Clark.",
      "This year's tournament has seen a slight decrease in ratings so far, which shouldn't come as a surprise with Clark now in the WNBA. Still, the early rounds were the second-most watched ever, as many tuned in to see big names like Paige Bueckers and UConn gear up for their national championship run.",
      "\u201cThe Women\u2019s Final Four has been incredibly exciting,\u201d said Florida men's basketball coach Todd Golden. \u201cI think it would be pretty neat to be able to bring the fan bases, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side, together and have an experience like that. There is never too much great basketball that you can have going on at the same place at the same time, especially in the collegiate ranks.\u201d",
      "UConn coach Geno Auriemma and LSU's Kim Mulkey weren't happy with the current Super Regional format for the women's tournament because of what they described as travel inconveniences and an inability for much of their fanbases to get to their games in Spokane, Washington.",
      "It\u2019s the third season that the four women\u2019s regionals have been consolidated into two sites. This year, the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were played in Spokane and Birmingham, Alabama.",
      "The Huskies traveled cross-country from Connecticut to Washington, then flew nearly 3,000 miles back to Tampa for the semifinals the day after their Elite Eight game. Auriemma criticized the format again during the Final Four.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to shortchange\" the players, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sell them short, you know? ... You shouldn\u2019t be trying to make more money by shortchanging their experience. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody on the guys\u2019 side and the committee is going, \u2018I think we can save a couple dollars if we do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they worry about that.\u201d",
      "Baker said the goal of the Super Regional was to increase attendance and improve the quality of the experience for the players, which seems to be in line Ackerman's proposal.",
      "\u201cIt worked,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI mean, the attendance is up dramatically over the last three years in the regional rounds as a result of that.\u201d",
      "Baker also estimated the NCAA spent at least $15 million on the women\u2019s tournament over the past few years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure when the tournament\u2019s over, people will sit down,\u201d he said, \"the committee will take all the feedback they got from everybody they heard from and make decisions for the future.\"",

      "\u201cI congratulate you on your outstanding record. You have surpassed legendary masters in the number of goals scored in National Hockey League regular-season games,\u201d Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin on Monday.",
      "Breaking Gretzky\u2019s record \u201chas become not only your personal success, but also a real celebration for fans in Russia and abroad,\u201d Putin added. \u201cI wish you health, good fortune (and) fighting spirit to conquer new heights in life and in sports.\u201d",

      "Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL goals record became the talk of the league a time of the season usually reserved only for playoff races",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alex Ovechkin could not contain his happiness moments after scoring his 895th goal to break Wayne Gretzky's NHL record and etch his name into the history books.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d he told teammates in an electric visiting arena with over 17,000 fans locked in on his every move. \"It\u2019s history! Yeah!\u201d",
      "Ovechkin celebrated No. 895 with the same joy he oozed after so many of his first 894, bellyflopping onto the ice like he did into fountains in Washington when he and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018. That was the high-water mark for the franchise earning its first championship, but this stuck out in a different way.",
      "The Cup gets handed out once a year. Ovechkin broke a record that stood for more than three decades, with the chance for his reign to last even longer. At a time of the season in a team-centric sport that is usually reserved only for playoff races, Ovechkin's \u201cGR8 Chase\u201d captivated the hockey community and brought joy not only to the sport but the rest of the world eager to witness something special.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Ovi,\u201d said center Dylan Strome, who along with Tom Wilson had the assists on Ovechkin's record-breaker Sunday in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders. \u201cEveryone wants to see him succeed because he\u2019s such a happy guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he scores a goal or someone else scores a goal: He\u2019s just as happy. And I think that\u2019s a credit to him and his character, and you could see why other people are so happy for him because of the way he treats other people.\u201d",
      "The charismatic Russian superstar has made a career out of scoring like no one else and commemorating the moment even better. Whether it was jumping into the glass or mimicking that his stick was on fire, Ovechkin became one of the faces of the game for how he always acted like a little kid playing a grown-up sport.",
      "\"You just smile every time you see it,\" coach Spencer Carbery said, echoing Strome about Ovechkin being just as happy to see his teammates score. \u201cIt speaks to him, but also who he is as a captain and as a leader, of the happiness and joy that he has to win and to see others have success and others to score goals, as well.\u201d",
      "No team or goaltender wanted to be the one to give up No. 895, but the Islanders \u2014 and netminder Ilya Sorokin, specifically, giving Ovechkin his stick when asked \u2014 still had full appreciation of the moment they were a part of.",
      "\u201cNo matter what team you were cheering for tonight, everyone was a hockey fan,\" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. \u201cEveryone on our side and their side can appreciate Ovi's accomplishment.\"",
      "The run-up to the accomplishment was half the fun. Goal-counters from Washington to Moscow tracked the quest. Ticket prices surged and subsided based on how close Ovechkin was to catching and passing Gretzky.",
      "If the pressure was mounting on Ovechkin at 39 in the twilight of his career, he sure didn't show it. And the Capitals made it their life's work to get him the record.",
      "It finally came midway through the 77th game out of 82, bringing relief to everyone involved.",
      "\u201cOver the last couple of weeks, it has now turned into he\u2019s right there,\u201d Carbery said. \u201cAnd for us, especially as coaches, we go to the hundreds and hundreds of hours that we\u2019ve been trying to figure out ways to get him the next goal. (When) you\u2019ve been working 80-hour weeks for the last two years to try to help get the next goal, it\u2019s a pretty special moment for us to celebrate.\u201d",
      "The NHL and the Capitals put together a video montage of greats from Simone Biles and Michael Phelps to Tom Brady, LeBron James and Derek Jeter to congratulate Ovechkin. In that moment, it was clear this accomplishment transcended hockey \u2014 and even sports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great for the game,\u201d Ovechkin said. \"It\u2019s great for us to be involved for this moment. ... Right now, people celebrate, people are happy and I\u2019m just happy to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Longtime teammate John Carlson, who assisted on the tying 894th goal on Friday night in the first half of a wild weekend party, said he and the Capitals \u201cwere just along for the ride.\u201d So was everyone else watching, and Ovechkin provided a ride of a lifetime.",

      "Now, with Clark and Reese in the WNBA, Bueckers headed to the league and Watkins sidelined for the foreseeable future with an ACL injury, it raises the question of who will pick up the torch and continue that momentum.",
      "There may be no clear candidate to become the face of the game, though there's no shortage of talented players, including UCLA\u2019s Lauren Betts, UConn freshman Sarah Strong and South Carolina freshman Joyce Edwards. And there are more looming on the horizon, like high school sensation Aaliyah Chavez will be making her collegiate debut at Oklahoma next season.",
      "The ratings for the women's NCAA Tournament leading into the title game Sunday didn\u2019t match last year\u2019s record numbers, though they were better than nearly every other year in NCAA history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great sign that without Caitlin we\u2019re still certainly on the ascent,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cHopefully, that\u2019s the same even without the star power next year of Paige Bueckers and JuJu. The game is at place where it can still grow.\u201d",
      "The talent pool continues to get stronger, as was evident in the title game performances by Strong (24 points and 15 rebounds) and Edwards (10 points, five rebounds). As expected, both impacted the game though UConn came away with its 12th national championship, ending a nine-year drought with an 82-59 victory over South Carolina.",
      "\u201cRuns like this make you still feel relevant, you still have an impact. Kids still respond,\u201d Huskies coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cOur coaching staff is really, really good at what they do. And I\u2019m fortunate enough to coach great kids who want to win for each other.\u201d",
      "Even though UConn was back on top at the end, more teams showed this season they could compete with the best. UCLA, which held the No. 1 spot in the AP poll for 14 weeks, had no seniors on its team and coming off its first NCAA Final Four ever, could go a step further next season.",
      "South Carolina will be back too with a young nucleus led by Edwards and MiLaysia Fulwiley.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for what our team will look like next year,\u201d South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. \u201cI am, because I do think they\u2019ll be talented enough to get here, especially with getting in the transfer portal and getting some experienced pieces that can help with this young group.\u201d",
      "Women's basketball, like other college sports, has changed the last few years with the transfer portal. There are over 1,200 players currently in the portal, a person with access to it shared with The Associated Press.",
      "Where some of those impact players \u2014 Olivia Miles, Cotie McMahon and Ta'Niya Latson \u2014 end up could not only shape which teams rise up to challenge UConn and South Carolina next season, but also which player separates herself from the rest.",

      "Photos on social media showed a goose nesting in a juniper planter next to the center-field seats underneath the scoreboard during Saturday\u2019s game. Several rows of the upper bleachers were blocked off from fans Sunday while two Canada geese stood on a roof nearby. Fans snapped photos of the feathered duo before Sunday\u2019s game began.",
      "\u201cAt the Friendly Confines, we truly mean it when we say everyone\u2019s welcome, including the goose and her nest who took up residence in the bleachers,\u201d Cubs Senior Director of Communications Jennifer Martinez said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re giving her the space she needs while we\u2019ve been working closely with a wildlife organization to manage the situation safely and responsibly, in full accordance with state law. In the meantime, we have blocked off the area to fans. Protecting our fans, and our feathered guest, is our top priority.\u201d",
      "One goose appeared to be sitting on the nest a couple of hours before first pitch but took off flying with its mate.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the best view of the game,\u201d said Michael Pardun, 26, of Chicago, who attended the game with friends in the bleachers. \u201cThey\u2019re diehard fans.\"",
      "Season-ticket holders Debbie Hultine, 69, and Buster Zenor, 71, of Spring Valley, Illinois, moved from their usual seats in the bleachers to accommodate the geese. They saw the female goose nesting during the Cubs\u2019 home opener Friday and again Saturday. They said they thought the geese chose the bushy area when the ballpark was quiet before the Cubs played their first home game, a 3-1 victory over the Padres.",
      "\u201cShe was pretty calm for 42,000-plus people,\u201d Hultine said of the female goose.",
      "The geese became agitated when fans banged on a nearby wall during Friday\u2019s game, Hultine said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both keeping an eye on things,\u201d Hultine said. \u201cThe male will keep sentry for a while. Opening day, he was above the press box sitting up by one of the flags. When she got a little upset when guys were banging, she honked and he did come back and he was up there for a very short time with his wings out and he was hissing.\u201d",
      "Hultine has been attending games for more than 60 years, and she and Zenor were married at Wrigley. She said this is the first time she has seen a goose nest in the ballpark.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re protecting them now,\u201d Zenor said.",

      "Microsoft says it's \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio",
      "Microsoft said it is \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of its data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio, the latest sign that the demand for artificial intelligence technology that drove a massive infrastructure expansion might not need quite as many powerful computers as expected.",
      "The tech giant confirmed this week that it is halting early-stage projects on rural land it owns in central Ohio's Licking County, outside of Columbus, and will reserve two of the three sites for farmland.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\u201d said Noelle Walsh, the president of Microsoft's cloud operations, in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "Walsh said \u201cany significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.\u201d",
      "Microsoft didn't say Wednesday what other projects it has slowed outside of Ohio, but in late December it revealed it was pausing the later phases of a large data center project in Wisconsin.",
      "Analysts with TD Cowen reported earlier this year that Microsoft was also scaling back some of its international data center expansion and canceling some leases in the U.S. for use of data centers operated by other companies.",
      "Other analysts for months have tied some of the changes to a shift in Microsoft's close relationship with its business partner OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI was moving in one direction\u201d by prioritizing the development of ever-more advanced AI systems, which require vast computing resources to train on troves of data, while \u201cMicrosoft may not have been moving that same direction,\u201d said Craig Ellis, director of research at B. Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",
      "The work \u201cmarks a major leap forwards and offers an invaluable community resource for future discoveries,\u201d wrote Harvard neuroscientists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht, who weren\u2019t involved in the project.",

      "A better understanding of the abundance of water in the lunar mantle can help explain how the moon evolved, the researchers noted. But it could also be all the more reason for astronauts to stick close to the near side of the moon as currently planned.",
      "China became the first country to land on the moon\u2019s far side last year. The Chang\u2019e 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system.",
      "The Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes.",
      "They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of what\u2019s been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moon\u2019s near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram.",
      "Given the limited sampling, it\u2019s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cMore far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling\" how much water there is, Hu said in an email.",
      "It\u2019s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres.",
      "Even if confirmed, the findings shouldn\u2019t drastically alter NASA\u2019s plans to send astronauts to the moon\u2019s south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.",

      "The social media company also said it was extending safeguards for users under 18 to Facebook and Messenger.",
      "Meta launched its teen account program for Instagram in September to give parents more options to supervise their children's online activity amid a growing backlash against how social media affects the lives of young people.",
      "The latest changes will roll out first to users in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, before going out to global users in the following months.",
      "Under the changes, teens under 16 are blocked from using Instagram Live unless parents give permission. They also need permission to \u201cturn off our feature that blurs images containing suspected nudity\u201d in direct messages, Meta said in a blog post.",
      "In another major update, Meta said it's extending the teen account safeguards to its Facebook and Messenger platforms,",
      "These will include protections already in place for teen Instagram users, including setting teen accounts to private by default, blocking private messages from strangers, strict limits on sensitive content like fight videos, reminders to get off the app after 60 minutes and notifications that are halted during bedtime hours.",
      "\u201cTeen Accounts on Facebook and Messenger will offer similar, automatic protections to limit inappropriate content and unwanted contact, as well as ways to ensure teens\u2019 time is well spent,\u201d Meta said.",
      "The company said at least 54 million teen accounts have been set up since the program launched in September.",

      "The National Weather Service is no longer providing language translations of its products, a change that experts say could put non-English speakers at risk of missing potentially life-saving warnings about extreme weather.",
      "The weather service has \u201cpaused\u201d the translations because its contract with Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, has lapsed, NWS spokesman Michael Musher said. He declined further comment.",
      "Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, began providing translations in late 2023, replacing manual translations that the weather service had said were labor-intensive and not sustainable and eventually. It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",
      "NOAA referred questions about the contract to a message on its website announcing the contract had lapsed. Lilt did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Nearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home, including 42 million Spanish speakers, according to 2019 Census data.",
      "Not being able to read urgent weather alerts could be a matter of life or death, said Joseph Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has worked with NOAA researching how to translate weather and climate information to the public, including the use of artificial intelligence.",
      "He said translated weather alerts saved lives during a deadly tornado outbreak in Kentucky in 2021. A Spanish-speaking family interviewed afterward said they got a tornado alert on their cellphone in English but ignored it because they didn't understand it, he said. When the same alert came in Spanish, they quickly sought shelter, he said.",
      "\u201cIt saved their life,\u201d said Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n.",
      "Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n said weather alerts used to be translated by forecasters that spoke more than one language, a task that could be \u201ccompletely overwhelming\u201d on top of their forecasting duties.",
      "The translations are important for more than extreme weather events, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University. General weather forecasts are essential for a number of sectors including tourism, transportation and energy. Families and businesses can make more informed decisions when they can get weather information that often includes actions that should be taken based on the forecast.",
      "Norma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there are many people in the U.S. that function with limited English relevant to their daily routines. For example, a shopkeeper might be able to have short conversations with customers, but might not have the same understanding when it comes to reading weather or climate terminologies.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t have access to that National Weather Service information in the different languages, that could be the difference between life and death for somebody,\u201d said Mendoza-Denton.",

      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",

The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",

      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",

      "The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.",
      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",
      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",
      "The research continues: Only one victim has been confirmed as a Roman warrior. Archaeologists hope DNA and strontium isotope analysis will help further identify the fighters, and whose side they were on.",

      "House Republicans are exhausting all legislative tools to prevent future votes on repealing President Donald Trump's tariffs -- doubling down on their support for the administration's policies.",
      "GOP leaders on Wednesday inserted language into the \"rule\" for the budget blueprint that would prohibit the House, until at least September, from forcing a vote on legislation to rescind Trump's national emergencies authority.",
      "\"The rule provides that each day during the period from April 9, 2025, through September 30, 2025, shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622) with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency declared by the President on April 2, 2025,\" the rule states.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., defended the move, telling reporters, \"I've made it very clear I think the president has executive authority. It's an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That's part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries.\"",
      "Johnson said Trump told him Tuesday night that \"there are almost 70 countries that are [in] some stage in negotiation of more fair-trade agreement agreements with the United States. I think that is in the interest of the American people. I think that is an 'America First' policy that will be effective, and so we have to give them the space to do it.\"",

      "This is the second time Johnson has moved to stop the legislative calendar to prevent votes on Trump's authority on tariffs. Under House rules, these votes would typically come up within 15 calendar days but now will not if the \"rule\" passes during the vote series Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\"I think you've got to give him the space,\" Johnson argued on Trump's tariffs. \"It is having the desired effect right now. You see a number of nations going forward and proposing much more free trade agreements with the United States. The American people deserve that.\"",

      "If Johnson can pull off passing the legislation through the House in the face of likely drama on the House floor, he will deliver Trump a major win.",

      "However, Roy said Tuesday that he still had concerns with the budget blueprint and will likely vote against the bill, telling reporters that the resolution has \"enough\" GOP objections to tank it.",
      "\"I'm not here for aspirations,\" he posted on X. \"The Senate's bill does not add up - it's all tax cuts with no spending cuts which = deficits.\"",

      "\"Just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just got to get there,\" Trump said. \"Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding. Just stop grandstanding.\"",

      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with a bevy of worries about the economic impacts of the president\u2019s sweeping tariff strategy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Manufacturers struggling to make long-term plans. Farmers facing retaliation from Chinese buyers. U.S. households burdened with higher prices.",
      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with those worries and many more as they fret about the economic impact of the president's sweeping tariff strategy that went into effect Wednesday.",
      "In a Senate hearing and interviews with reporters this week, Republican skepticism of President Donald Trump's policies ran unusually high. While GOP lawmakers made sure to direct their concern at Trump's aides and advisers \u2014 particularly U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who appeared before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday \u2014 it still amounted to a rare Republican break from a president they have otherwise championed.",
      "Lawmakers had reason to worry: the stock market has been in a volatile tumble for days and economists are warning that the plans could lead to a recession.",
      "\"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer as he pressed for an answer on which Trump aide to hold accountable if there is an economic downturn.",
      "Tillis' frustration was aimed at the across-the-board tariff strategy that could potentially hamstring U.S. manufacturers who are currently dependent on materials like aluminum and steel from China. His home state of North Carolina, where he is up for reelection next year, has attracted thousands of foreign firms looking to invest in the state's manufacturing industries.",
      "Ever wary of crossing Trump, Republicans engaged in a delicate two-step of criticizing the rollout of the tariffs then shifting to praise for the president's economic vision. In the afternoon, Tillis in a Senate floor speech said that the \u201cpresident is right in challenging other nations who have for decades abused their relationship with the United States,\" yet went on to question who in the White House was thinking through the long-term economic effects of the sweeping tariffs.",
      "Tillis even allowed that Trump's trade strategy could still turn out to be effective, but said there is a short window to show that it is worth the higher prices and layoffs that will burden workers.",
      "For his part, Greer emphasized to the committee that the U.S. was engaged in negotiations with other countries but that \u201cthe trade deficit has been decades in the making, and it's not going to be solved overnight.\u201d",
      "Republican leaders in Congress, as well as a sizeable chunk of lawmakers, have emphasized that Trump needs time to implement his strategy. They've mostly rejected the idea of putting a check on Trump's tariff power, but it is clear that anxiety is growing among rank-and-file Republicans about what's ahead.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said there is a company in his state that had spent \u201cmillions of dollars\" moving its parts production from China to Vietnam. But now that Vietnam is facing steep tariffs, the business is unable to move forward with negotiating prices with retailers.",
      "Lankford pressed Greer for a timeline for negotiations, but the trade representative responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any particular timeline. The outcome is more important than setting something artificially for us.\u201d",
      "Trade agreements between countries typically take months or even years to work out and often require the parties to navigate through a host of legal, economic and business issues. Still, Republicans said they were encouraged by the indications that Trump is entering into negotiations with other nations.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said at the committee hearing that he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by news of trade negotiations and attributed a momentary upward tick in the stock market to \u201chope that these tariffs are a means and not solely an end.\u201d",
      "He told Greer, \"Who pays these high tariffs? It will be the consumer. I\u2019m worried about the inflationary effect. I\u2019m worried if there is a trade war that we\u2019re going to have markets shutting down for American farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.\u201d",
      "Other GOP lawmakers contended that the pain was worth bearing. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the president is on the right track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pain, but it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president will make the right call. He\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Still, traditional Republicans were looking for ways to push back on Trump's tariff plan.",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican, has introduced a bipartisan bill to give Congress the power to review and approve of new tariffs, and Republican members in the House were also working to gain support for a similar bill. Such legislation would allow Congress to claw back some of its constitutional power over tariff policy, which has been almost completely handed over to the president in recent decades through legislation.",
      "But the White House has already indicated that Trump would veto the bill, and both Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have said they are not interested in bringing it up for a vote.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican closely aligned with Trump, said on social media that the bill was a bad idea because \u201cCongress moves at the pace of a tortoise running a race.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason why Congress gave this authority to the president to begin with is because the ability to pivot,\u201d he added.",
      "But the president's unclear messaging has also left lawmakers only guessing as they try to decipher which advisers and aides hold sway in the White House.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said that as he\u2019s received calls from the business community in his state, he\u2019s had no answers for them besides telling them the prospects for the economy are uncertain. The communication from the president\u2019s aides has often been conflicting, Kennedy said even as he voiced support for Trump\u2019s long-term goals.",
      "Kennedy told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to double or triple your tariffs on the world when you're the wealthiest country in all of human history without being somewhat shambolic.\"",

      "Musk's insults Tuesday came after Navarro called the Tesla CEO a \"car assembler\" rather than a \"manufacturer,\" claiming that key components of his Teslas come from overseas.",
      "That prompted Musk to respond.",
      "\"Navarro is truly a moron. What he says here is demonstrably false,\" he posted on X.",
      "He claimed in a second post, \"Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,\" and tagged Navarro's handle in the post.",
      "Asked about the feud at Tuesday's White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed it as \"boys will be boys.\"",
      "\"No, look, these are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,\" Leavitt said. \"And you guys should all be very grateful that we have the most transparent administration in history.\"",
      "Musk threw shade at Navarro early Saturday morning over his Harvard education.",
      "After a social media user posted a clip defending Navarro's explanation of the White House's tariffs, pointing out his PhD in economics from Harvard, Musk responded, \"A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing. Results in the ego/brains>>1 problem.\"",
      "In an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Navarro responded to Musk's posts, saying, \"Elon, when he's in his DOGE lane, is great, but we understand what's going on here. Elon sells cars. He's simply protecting his own interests.\"",
      "\"There's no rift here,\" he added. \"Look, Elon, he's got X, he's got a big microphone. We don't mind him saying whatever he wants. But, just, the American people need to understand that we understand what that's all about, and it's fine.\"",
      "Musk said he offered Trump advice on tariffs when he spoke via live stream in Washington to the Italy's League Congress Conference in Florence on Saturday.",
      "Musk expressed his hope for the U.S. and Europe to create \"a very close, stronger partnership\" and reach a \"zero-tariff\" policy soon.",
      "\"I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said.",
      "\"And also more freedom of people to move between Europe and North America if they wish, if they wish to work in Europe or wish to work in America, they should be allowed to do so, in my view. So that has certainly been my advice to the president,\" he continued.",

      "Heather Hagan, a U.S. Army spokeswoman, said Tuesday that a decision on the parade was \"pre-decisional.\" She noted that the Army is planning to celebrate its milestone birthday with \"multiple events\" leading up to June 14, including a festival on the National Mall.",
      "\"We intend to have a national level celebration to increase pride in America and America's Army,\" she wrote in a statement. \"Given the significant milestone of 250 years, the Army is exploring options to make the celebration bigger, with more capability demonstrations, static displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community.\"",
      "Trump's 2018 vision for a parade included vintage aircraft and fighter jets swooping over the streets of Washington with heavy tanks below. But the event never materialized as city officials pushed back and cost estimates topped tens of millions of dollars.",
      "If a parade were to take place, it would significantly impact the city's infrastructure, according to city officials. Bowser said the 14th Street Bridge would need to be tested before the event.",
      "The iconic bridge has undergone several significant repairs and maintenance in recent decades, most notably after the 1982 Air Florida Flight 90 crash.",

      "\"This is a meeting that's happening, right? On Saturday, there's a meeting. There's no negotiations,\" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is a dynamic where the president has made very clear and certainly the secretary has made very clear that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,\" she said. \"It's touching base, yes. Again, it's not a negotiation. It's a meeting.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 17:31:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has called for the expansion of U.S. coal production, claiming that an increase of \"clean\" coal produced in the U.S. will soon take place.",
    "story": [
      "Coal may be \"cleaner than ever,\" but it's still not \"clean\" energy, experts say.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand the mining and use of coal in the U.S., calling it \"beautiful, clean coal.\"",
      "During a ceremony at the White House, surrounded by hard-hat-clad coal miners, Trump signed the \"Unleashing American Energy\" executive order that follows the president's recent promises to oversee a boost of coal production in the U.S.",
      "The action directs the Interior Department to facilitate coal leases for millions of acres of public lands. Trump's order also directs the Energy Department and other agencies to research if coal can be used to supply electricity for artificial intelligence data centers.",
      "The comments Tuesday follow plans announced last month for a sweeping rollback of longstanding regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency -- which the Trump administration has called the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.\"",
      "Several of the 31 actions announced by the agency in March targeted prior regulations meant to restrict emissions and pollution related to the use of coal. Chief among these was the announcement to \"reconsider\" President Joe Biden's \"Clean Power Plan 2.0,\" which was a group of regulations targeting coal and natural gas power plants announced last year.",
      "The \"Clean Power Plan 2.0\" tightened the emissions standards for coal-fired power plants for toxic metals like mercury and forced plants to control and clean coal ash released during their operations. But during his campaign, Trump spoke favorably about using more coal to power America's energy needs.",
      "Coal is an abundant, energy-dense resource with a higher concentration in the U.S. than any other country in the world, but it is also a fossil fuel and creates carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) when burned, which contributes to global warming and human-amplified climate change. Coal emissions can also lead to health issues, including respiratory illness, lung disease, acid rain, smog, and neurological and developmental damage.",
      "While coal-fired electricity has become \"cleaner than ever,\" according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the fossil fuel is still responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions and environment-polluting coal ash. So \"clean coal\" is a bit of a misnomer, sometimes referring to types of technology used to physically clean coal before it is burned or capture carbon related to its burning, according to Michelle Solomon, senior policy analyst at Energy Innovation.",
      "\"Burning coal could never be technically considered clean regardless of the treatment applied to it before combustion \u2013 it will always emit the largest concentration of greenhouse gases of any fossil fuel, and soil and water pollution from coal and coal ash (what's left after it's burned) will never go away,\" Solomon said. \"Even the best technologies that reduce air pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen oxides still allow many of these to get through.\"",
      "These technologies are also not widely used in the U.S. According to a December 2023 report from the Congressional Budget Office, 15 carbon capture and storage facilities are operating in the United States. And none of them are being used at coal-burning power plants. The CBO also found that the 15 facilities can capture \"0.4% of percent of the United States' total annual emissions of CO2.\"",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the most significant factor in recent reductions of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. has been the decline in coal usage. In 2022, coal-fired electricity generation was largely replaced by other sources, primarily natural gas and renewables. As the production of cleaner alternatives continues to grow, the reliance on coal to meet the country's energy needs continues to diminish.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump's tariffs roil global markets, some of the thought leaders and influential podcasters who backed the Republican's campaign are voicing doubts.",
      "Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and even Elon Musk are adding their voices to a number of congressional Republicans who have weighed in against the tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday.",
      "Here's a look at some of what they've said:",
      "The conservative commentator \u2014 who initially backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in last year\u2019s GOP presidential primary before lending his support to Trump \u2014 said Saturday on the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast that he saw \u201ccontradictory\u201d claims as to what Trump\u2019s tariff proposals are intended to do.",
      "\u201cI think that the way that the tariff plan was rolled out is about as bad a rollout as you could do,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "In a video posted Monday to his more than 7 million subscribers on YouTube, Shapiro reiterated that argument and said that the idea that tariffs are good and make us rich is \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea that this is inherently good and makes the American economy strong is wrongheaded,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cIt\u2019s untrue. The idea that it is going to result in massive re-shoring of manufacturing is also untrue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWelcome to Orange Monday,\u201d Portnoy said on his \u201cDavey Day Trader\u201d financial livestream, just before markets opened this week, saying there\u2019s \u201cno political agenda\u201d to his commentary, other than to make money.",
      "After last week\u2019s market plunge, Portnoy said he had lost $7 million \u201cin stocks and crypto,\u201d a figure he estimated on Monday was likely closer to $20 million, or up to 15% of his net worth.",
      "But, Portnoy has said, he plans to stick with Trump, whom he has called \u201ca smart guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re smarter than me when it comes to these tariffs. I also think he\u2019s playing a high-stakes game here,\u201d Portnoy said last week on his livestream. \u201cI\u2019m gonna roll with him for a couple days, a couple weeks, see how this pans out.\u201d",
      "Founded by Portnoy in 2003 as a free sports and gambling newspaper, Barstool has grown into a digital platform covering sports, lifestyle, and entertainment, with hundreds of millions of followers. Portnoy has been a loyal Trump supporter since first endorsing him in 2016, interviewing the president at the White House in 2020.",
      "Rogan, one of the nation's most influential podcasters who endorsed Trump on the eve of last year's election, said in March that Trump's feud with Canada was \u201cstupid\u201d and bemoaned the fact that Canadians \u201cbooed us over tariffs\" during professional sporting events featuring teams from both countries.",
      "Rogan has recently broken with Trump in other areas, including over wide-ranging deportations, referring to a recent operation to detain immigrants as \u201chorrific.\u201d",
      "Just weeks before Election Day, Rogan taped a nearly three-hour podcast interview with Trump, an opportunity for the Republican nominee to highlight the hypermasculine tone that defined much of his 2024 White House bid.",
      "The pro-Trump hedge fund manager warned Sunday on X that \u201cwe are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter\u201d unless Trump took a more deliberate approach, likening the full tariff activation \u201ceconomic nuclear war.\u201d",
      "In another post later Sunday, Ackman assailed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \u201cindifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing.\u201d The next day, Ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that Lutnick \u2014 previously the head of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald \u2014 could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments.",
      "But the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "Even the billionaire top adviser to Trump on overhauling the federal government is expressing skepticism about tariffs, which he has said would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker.",
      "\u201cI hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\u201d Musk said in a video conference with Italian politicians.",
      "On Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d the situation.",

      "\"On Monday, several Trump administration agencies froze roughly $790M of federal funding and roughly $1.05B of federal funding from Northwestern and Cornell, respectively,\" a senior administration official told ABC News. \"The money was frozen in connection with several ongoing, credible, and concerning Title VI investigations.\"",
      "The funding pause mostly involves grants from and contracts with the Department of Agriculture, Defense, Education and Health and Human Services, according to White House officials.",

      "If the funding halt is justified under the Civil Rights Act, as White House officials have told ABC News, Lakier said the law requires there to be a set of procedures followed and notice given.",
      "\"There has to be a hearing. You have to give members of Congress 30 days before you do it. You have to give the school 30 days. You have to allow the right to appeal. None of this is being followed,\" Lakier said.",
      "Michael Dorf, professor at Cornell Law School, echoed Lakier's assessment.",
      "\"There's a federal statute that explains if agencies and the government believe a funding recipient is not complying with its civil rights obligations, there's a whole set of procedures they have to follow before you cut those off,\" Dorf said. \"The government has followed none of those procedures.\"",
      "The move comes as the administration doubles down on allegations of antisemitic conduct and harassment from elite universities.",
      "The Department of Education and other agencies are reviewing Harvard University for allegedly fostering antisemitism on its campus. The administration stripped Columbia University of $400 million in grants earlier this month after a task force investigation says it found inaction by the school to protect Jewish students.",

      "A federal appeals court has cleared the way for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to fire thousands of probationary workers, halting a judge\u2019s order requiring them to be reinstated",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court cleared the way Wednesday for President Donald Trump's administration to fire thousands of probationary workers, halting a judge\u2019s order requiring them to be reinstated in a legal win for Trump's effort to dramatically downsize the federal workforce.",
      "The decision comes a day after a similar order from the Supreme Court in another lawsuit filed over mass firings.",
      "A split panel for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the government will probably win by showing the mass firings must be appealed through a separate employment process rather than fought out in federal court.",
      "The decision comes in a lawsuit filed by nearly two dozen states that had argued the mass firings will cause irreparable burdens and expenses to support recently unemployed workers. They said at least 24,000 probationary employees have been terminated since Trump took office in January.",
      "The states could still seek further review as the lawsuit continues to play out.",
      "The Republican administration has argued that the states have no right to try to influence the federal government\u2019s relationship with its own workers. It has already reinstated, however, some 15,000 workers to full duty or paid leave under judicial order, according to court documents.",
      "The Supreme Court also sided with the Trump administration on Tuesday in an order involving a technical legal assessment of the right, or standing, of several nonprofit associations to sue over the firings.",
      "Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they\u2019re usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection.",
      "The states suing the Trump administration are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin, along with Washington, D.C.",

      "A judge says an accuser will be allowed to use the word \u201cforce\u201d in her testimony at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s retrial even though the disgraced movie mogul was acquitted of a rape charge that alleged he used physical force against her",
      "NEW YORK -- An accuser will be allowed to use the word \u201cforce\u201d in her testimony at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s retrial even though the disgraced movie mogul was acquitted of a rape charge that alleged he used physical force against her, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber reversed his earlier decision to forbid the one-time aspiring actor from telling jurors that Weinstein used force against her, explaining that after a review of case law he decided it would be unreasonable to put limits on how she describes what she says happened.",
      "\u201cShe will not be precluded from using the term force or describing the use of force,\" Farber said at the last pretrial hearing before jury selection is set to begin next Tuesday.",
      "The woman is one of three accusers whose allegations form the basis of the charges in Weinstein\u2019s retrial in state court in Manhattan.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argued that letting the woman testify that he used physical force during the encounter at a Manhattan hotel would open the door to telling jurors that Weinstein was acquitted at his 2020 trial of first-degree rape, a charge that says \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d was used. It was the most serious charge related to her allegations.",
      "But Farber said that isn't necessarily the case. He said Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are free to challenge the woman\u2019s version of events on cross examination and he suggested that they could add a jury instruction to clear up any confusion.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office has wanted to prevent jurors from hearing any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a sex crime charge as well as third-degree rape, which involves a lack of consent but not \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d Authorities said he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006, and raped an aspiring actor in 2013.",
      "Weinstein is also being tried on an additional charge based on an allegation from a woman whose rape allegation was added to the case last year. That charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for his retrial. His acquittals, on the first-degree rape charge and two counts of predatory sexual assault, still stand.",
      "The trial's start time was thrown into doubt Wednesday as Weinstein\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors wrangled over notes that an assistant district attorney on the case took during a 2020 interview with the accuser who was not part of the first case.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers said they may seek to call the notetaking assistant district attorney as a witness, disqualifying her from working on the case, as they seek to undermine the accuser\u2019s credibility. The defense contends the woman\u2019s grand jury testimony last year about Weinstein using physical force on her was inconsistent with what she said in the 2020 interview.",
      "Prosecutors said they would seek to delay the trial by 60 days if they can\u2019t reach an agreement with Weinstein\u2019s lawyers on the note dispute.",
      "The woman whom Farber said can say \u201cforce\u201d in her upcoming testimony broke down in tears when she testified at Weinstein\u2019s 2020 trial, prompting the judge to halt proceedings for the day.",
      "The woman alleged the studio boss trapped her in a New York hotel room in March 2013, angrily ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "\u201cI want the jury to know that he is my rapist,\" the woman told jurors in 2020.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the state Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won\u2019t be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",
      "Farber ruled Wednesday that if Weinstein were to testify at his retrial, prosecutors can ask him if he has a felony conviction in California, but not the nature of the crimes or underlying facts.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S Treasury Department on Wednesday issued new sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear program, just days before senior American and Iranian officials are expected to hold talks in the Middle East sultanate of Oman.",
      "Five entities and one person based in Iran are cited in the new sanctions for their support of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The designated groups include the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and subordinates Iran Centrifuge Technology Company, Thorium Power Company, Pars Reactors Construction and Development Company and Azarab Industries Co.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime\u2019s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons remains a grave threat to the United States and a menace to regional stability and global security,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cTreasury will continue to leverage our tools and authorities to disrupt any attempt by Iran to advance its nuclear program and its broader destabilizing agenda.\u201d",
      "The new sanctions come as President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that he was dispatching senior envoys to hold direct talks with Iran about its nuclear program, while warning the Iranians they would be in \u201cgreat danger\u201d if the talks don\u2019t succeed in persuading them to abandon their nuclear weapons program.",

      "Iran and the U.S., under President Joe Biden, held indirect negotiations in Vienna in 2021 aimed at restoring the nuclear deal. But those talks, and others between Tehran and European nations, failed to reach any agreement.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has suggested to federal agencies that they are free to blacklist a law firm targeted by President Donald Trump despite a judge's ruling that halted enforcement of a White House executive order that was meant to punish it.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates last month temporarily blocked provisions of a Trump executive order against the firm of Jenner & Block that called for the firm's employees to be denied access to federal buildings and for federal contracts held by the firm or its clients to be reviewed and terminated. The firm is among several prominent ones subject in recent weeks to similarly worded executive orders by the Republican president; some, like Jenner & Block, have sued over the orders, and others have reached settlements to avert being sanctioned by the White House.",
      "In a letter notifying agency heads about the ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House budget director Russell Vought criticized Bates as an \u201cunelected district court judge\u201d who has \u201cinvaded the policy-making and free speech prerogatives of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, as noted in the court order, agencies are permitted to carry on their ordinary course of business which carries with it the authority to decide with whom to work,\u201d said the letter, which was filed in court Tuesday.",
      "It later adds: \u201cAs it remains the Executive Branch\u2019s position that Executive Order 14246 was necessary policy the government reserves the right to take all necessary and legal actions regarding \u2018lawfare,\u2019 national security concerns, and discriminatory practices involving Jenner & Block.\u201d",
      "The position is seemingly at odds with the order from Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, that directed the Trump administration to tell federal agencies to disregard broad swaths of the executive order. A separate provision of the order, mandating the suspension of active security clearances of employees at the firm, was not challenged and remains unaffected.",
      "The letter was made public late Tuesday as part of a report filed by the Justice Department on the status of the Jenner & Block lawsuit. That firm, as well as WilmerHale, another firm targeted by an executive order, asked federal judges on Tuesday to permanently block enforcement of the orders.",
      "The executive order against Jenner & Block stemmed from the fact the firm once employed Andrew Weissmann, a lawyer who served on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team that investigated Trump during his first term in office over potential connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Weissmann, a frequent public target of Trump\u2019s ire, left the firm several years ago.",
      "Mueller has retired from WilmerHale, but another White House executive order mentioned him as well as another retired partner and a current partner who all served on Mueller\u2019s team.",

      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is calling for Democrats and Republicans to work together to help boost American manufacturing",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer delivered a speech emphasizing points of agreement with President Donald Trump on economic policy, just hours before their scheduled meeting \u2014 a reflection of the high-profile Democrat\u2019s more diplomatic approach toward the president as her party ramps up its attacks on him.",
      "Framed by Whitmer as a \u201cblueprint for success,\u201d her lengthy \u201cBuild, America, Build\u201d address called for bipartisan cooperation to boost American manufacturing. While she offered soft criticism of the president, she also underscored shared priorities.",
      "\u201cI understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and here\u2019s where President Trump and I do agree. We do need to make more stuff in America,\u201d said Whitmer, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not against tariffs outright, but they are a blunt tool. You can\u2019t just bust out the tariff hammer to swing at every problem without a clearly defined end-goal.\u201d",
      "The address, rescheduled from last week due to severe ice storms in northern Michigan, came ahead of her second one-on-one meeting with Trump in less than a month, in addition to a dinner at the White House where she sat next to him.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s meeting follows Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs expected to disproportionately affect Michigan, whose economy is closely tied to an auto industry reliant on trade with Canada, Mexico and other countries. She added that she would also be meeting with members of Trump's Cabinet, and she planned to discuss the impact of tariffs.",
      "Once one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics during his first term and the campaign trail last year, Whitmer has adopted a more measured tone toward the president since his reelection, delivering multiple speeches in which she has called for finding \u201ccommon ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d Whitmer said during a discussion after her speech. \u201cMy oath to the people of Michigan is to continue to show up, even when it means I\u2019m going to get my lunch handed to me.\u201d",
      "Whitmer\u2019s approach stands in sharp contrast to that of other high-profile Democratic governors, many of whom \u2014 like her \u2014 are seen as potential contenders for the party\u2019s 2028 presidential nomination.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has remained a leading voice of state-level opposition to Trump, sharply criticizing the new tariffs this week. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom appealed directly to international partners, urging them to spare his state from retaliatory measures and declaring, \u201cCalifornia is not Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "Whitmer faces a more challenging political landscape than either Pritzker or Newsom, with a divided state legislature and a state that went for Trump in two of the last three elections. But even Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of a state that voted for Trump in 2024, has taken a more critical approach toward Trump, telling reporters Tuesday that Trump is \u201clooking to screw over our farmers\u201d with tariffs.",
      "Whitmer's balance was seen in her address Wednesday and the conversation with former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson afterward. She agreed with Trump on the need to build more in America, but made it clear that she disagrees with his approach to tariffs, emphasizing that such a shift \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no shortcut here. Strategic reindustrialization must be a bipartisan project that spans multiple presidential administrations,\u201d Whitmer said in her address. \u201cLet\u2019s be strategic and put tariffs on the technology we actually want to make in America.\u201d",
      "Whitmer \u2014 who has less than two years left in office because of term limits \u2014 has spent much of this year traveling outside Michigan on international trade trips and visits to Washington, D.C., and other states, following a 2024 in which she dedicated considerable time campaigning for fellow Democrats.",
      "Despite this, she reiterated on Wednesday that she is not signaling a run for president in 2028, though her speech is unlikely to quiet the speculation.",
      "\u201cThis year and in the years to come \u2014 no matter who\u2019s in the White House \u2014 let\u2019s bet on American workers. Let\u2019s bring chip manufacturing back home. Let\u2019s dominate the seas and own the skies. Let\u2019s innovate and let\u2019s build,\u201d Whitmer said in closing.",

The White House confirmed the funding pauses late Tuesday night, but offered no further details on what it entails, or what grants to the schools are being affected.",
      "The moves come as the Trump administration has increasingly begun using governmental grant funding as a spigot to try and influence campus policy \u2014 previously cutting off money to schools including Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "That has left universities across the country struggling to navigate cuts to grants for research institutions.",
      "In a statement, Cornell said it had received more than 75 stop work orders earlier Tuesday from the Defense Department related to research \u201cprofoundly significant to American national defense, cybersecurity, and health\u201d but that it had not otherwise received any information confirming $1 billion in frozen grants.",

      "Prosecutors and attorneys for a man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in 2022 are set to argue some of the final ground rules they want for Bryan Kohberger\u2019s trial",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Prosecutors and attorneys for a man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in 2022 will argue some of the final ground rules they want for Bryan Kohberger's trial in a two-day hearing set to begin Wednesday morning.",
      "Kohberger, 30, is accused in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. Prosecutors say the four were killed in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022, and their bodies were discovered later that day.",
      "Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, was arrested in Pennsylvania weeks after the killings. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "When asked to enter a plea to the charges, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the case and the motion hearing as his trial is set to begin this summer.",
      "Attorneys on both sides of the case have filed hundreds of pages of legal motions, including whether Kohberger should face the death penalty if he is convicted, whether witnesses should be allowed to testify about things like \u201ctouch DNA,\u201d and about who should be allowed in the courtroom during the trial.",
      "The hearing will give the attorneys a chance to make their case in person, discussing the legal reasoning behind their requests. It will also give 4th District Judge Steven Hippler a chance to ask the attorneys questions as he weighs their arguments.",
      "Many of the motions are focused on what evidence can be presented to jurors during the trial.",
      "For instance, defense attorneys have asked the judge to find that an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis would make Kohberger ineligible for the death penalty. The defense and prosecution will also likely present arguments over whether jurors should hear audio of a 911 call made by two women in the house roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn\u2019t waking up.",
      "Legal filings also show that prosecutors want to introduce evidence of Kohberger's \u201cclick history\u201d at Amazon.com showing that he purchased a Ka-Bar brand fixed-blade knife eight months before the killings. A Ka-Bar knife sheath was found next to one of the victims.",
      "Kohberger\u2019s attorneys have asked the judge to exclude that online shopping history, saying it could be taken out of context or not reflect the influence of algorithms that recommend purchases.",
      "Prosecutors also want to introduce a photo that Kohberger took of himself hours after the time of the killings because they say it shows what he looked like at that time. A roommate who was in the rental home told police she woke up and saw a stranger with \u201cbushy eyebrows\u201d wearing a face mask inside the home.",
      "Defense attorneys want the judge to bar any testimony about \u201cbushy eyebrows,\u201d because they say it could prejudice the jury against him.",
      "Other topics that could come up include what kinds of questions will be asked during the jury selection process. Attorneys on both sides have submitted proposed questionnaires that could be used to narrow the jury pool down to a small group of candidates, but so far those documents have been sealed from public view.",
      "Hippler can \u201crule from the bench\u201d \u2014 simply telling the attorneys what his decision is on each request \u2014 but he can also decide to issue a written ruling sometime after the hearing is over. Sometimes written rulings can be particularly helpful in complicated legal cases like this one, because they can help attorneys quickly find and refer to the judge's decisions months or even years down the road.",
      "Jury selection in the case is expected to begin July 30, with the trial starting Aug. 11 in the Ada County Courthouse in downtown Boise.",
      "The trial is expected to take nearly three months to complete, lasting into the start of November.",

      "At about 5:30 p.m., 911 calls came in about a shooting at a town house complex in Spotsylvania County, just outside Fredericksburg and about 65 miles (105 kilometers) southwest of Washington, said Maj. Elizabeth Scott, spokesperson for the Spotsylvania Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "Officials urged people to avoid the area and those near the scene to stay indoors while authorities investigate, she said.",
      "The shooting may have been committed by more than one person, according to Scott. There were no immediate arrests or publicly released information about a possible motive.",

      "Training for 60 to 70 troops already is underway, the governor's office said.",
      "Governors typically call up the National Guard to help with natural disasters like wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. Governors in recent years also have ordered troops to address illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. In New York last year, the National Guard helped patrol the subway system following a series of high-profile crimes.",

      "Medina and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller pointed to a large chart during a news conference, saying nearly every category of crime has come down since the beginning of the year because of the work already being done by the police force.",
      "The National Guard will not be engaging with the public, they said, but rather taking on duties that drain the time of sworn officers, like directing traffic. The troops can help secure crime scenes, distribute food and supplies to the homeless population throughout the corridor, transport prisoners, provide courthouse security and run drone operations used for locating suspects or assessing incidents, officials said.",
      "Watchdog groups have concerns that militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations.",
      "Daniel Williams, policy advocate at the ACLU of New Mexico, called the governor\u2019s action a show of force, not a solution.",
      "\u201cNew Mexico already has one of the highest per capita rates of people killed by police in the nation,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHistory has shown that military collaboration with local law enforcement often leads to increased civil rights violations, racial profiling, and criminalization of vulnerable populations, particularly those experiencing homelessness and poverty.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the first time Lujan Grisham has tried to leverage state resources to address high crime rates in Albuquerque. In 2021, the two-term Democrat temporarily assigned state police officers to the area to help local authorities tackle vehicle thefts, drug trafficking, aggressive driving and the apprehension of violent criminals with felony warrants.",
      "The year before, then-President Donald Trump sent federal agents, including Homeland Security officers, to Albuquerque as part of an effort to contain violent crime. He also targeted Chicago and other U.S. cities with the surge in resources.",
      "Lujan Grisham's latest emergency declaration follows a March 31 request by Albuquerque's police chief, who pointed to the fentanyl epidemic and an increase in violent juvenile crime. Medina wrote that progress has been made in reducing shootings and aggravated assaults along what is known as Central Avenue but that more resources are needed.",
      "The New Mexico Legislature adjourned last month, drawing much criticism from law enforcement leaders, prosecutors and even the governor for failing to adequately bolster public safety in Albuquerque and other New Mexico communities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some Democratic-led states and cities are pushing back on a Trump administration threat to cut education funding over diversity, equity and inclusion programs, creating a standoff that could test how far the White House is willing to go to press its demands on the nation\u2019s schools.",
      "State leaders in Minnesota and New York said they will not comply with an Education Department order to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls \u201cillegal DEI practices.\u201d Chicago\u2019s mayor promised to sue over any cuts. California and Vermont told schools they don't need to respond.",
      "It amounts to some of the most forceful opposition the Education Department has faced as it uses federal funding as leverage to enact President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda on issues from DEI to campus antisemitism and transgender athletes. The White House has targeted colleges and K-12 schools alike, but unlike universities that rely greatly on federal grants and contracts, school systems get the vast majority of their money from state and local sources.",
      "In a letter Monday to the Education Department, Minnesota\u2019s education chief said the Trump administration overstepped its authority with its latest demand, adding that there\u2019s nothing illegal about DEI.",
      "\u201cThreats to this funding without backing in law or established requirements put key programs at risk that students and schools depend on every day,\u201d said Willie Jett, Minnesota's education commissioner. The federal department \u201cdoes not have the authority to unilaterally overrule the will of Congress.\u201d",
      "Jett said his letter would \u201cserve as our response\u201d to the Trump administration\u2019s demand.",
      "It follows a Friday letter from New York\u2019s education office challenging the federal government\u2019s latest demand. It said New York already has provided assurances that it follows federal law and \u201cno further certification will be forthcoming.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Education Department told state agencies in a letter Thursday they must sign a document saying they follow federal antidiscrimination laws and get the same assurance from schools. The document threatens to cut federal money for any civil rights violation, including using DEI practices \u201cto advantage one's race over another.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon commended Puerto Rico for being the first to submit its certification. \u201cEvery state that wants to continue receiving federal funds should follow suit,\u201d McMahon posted on X.",
      "The letter does not carry the force of law but threatens to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools that continue such practices \u201cin violation of federal law\u201d can face Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts, it said.",
      "The letter initially gave states 10 days to submit the certification. On Monday, the Education Department extended the deadline to April 24.",
      "A department spokesperson said the agency is \u201csimply asking school districts to certify they are following the law and not using race preferences or pernicious race stereotypes in schools.\u201d",
      "Even some Republican-led states believe they don\u2019t need to get the document signed by each school. Missouri\u2019s education office said schools previously provided assurances that should cover the department\u2019s demand and it will reach out to districts \u201cif additional information is necessary.\u201d",
      "Others are moving to follow the order, including Virginia and Arizona, where state education chief Tom Horne said the order \u201caligns completely with my philosophy.\u201d",
      "Vermont\u2019s education chief assured schools the state supports DEI practices and said superintendents won\u2019t need to sign the certification. Instead, the state will assure federal officials it\u2019s already following federal law, Zoie Saunders, the state\u2019s education secretary, said in a Monday letter to school districts.",
      "The Illinois board of education rebuked the federal agency, saying it\u2019s \u201cattempting to exert power over every district in the country \u2014 even as it claims it\u2019s returning education to the states.\u201d Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said his city is willing to go to court over the order, which he called federal overreach.",
      "The New York and Minnesota letters both cite past comments from Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education secretary during his first term, extolling the virtues of diversity and inclusion. In a 2020 memo to agency staff, DeVos wrote that \u201cembracing diversity and inclusion are key elements for success.\u201d The states argue the Education Department is shifting its position without explanation.",
      "The states also accuse the Education Department of making broad declarations about the illegality of DEI without citing policies that violate federal law. Minnesota\u2019s letter said if the federal agency has identified DEI practices that violate civil rights law, \u201cwe request advisement of them.\u201d",

Floodwaters forced the closure of the historic Buffalo Trace Distillery, close to the banks of the swollen Kentucky River near downtown Frankfort.",

      "Opening statements are expected Tuesday in the U.S. trial of a man accused of torturing political opponents of Gambia\u2019s ex-military dictator Yahya Jammeh nearly 20 years ago",
      "DENVER -- Opening statements are expected Tuesday in the trial of a man accused of torturing political opponents of Gambia's former military dictator Yahya Jammeh nearly 20 years ago, the latest international trial tied to his regime.",
      "Federal prosecutors invoked a rarely used law that allows people to be tried in the U.S. judicial system for torture allegedly committed abroad.",
      "Michael Sang Correa, a citizen of Gambia, was indicted in 2020 while living in the United States. He is charged with being part of a conspiracy to mentally and physically torture people suspected of involvement in a failed 2006 coup in Gambia.",
      "Prosecutors say Correa was part of a military unit known as the \u201cJunglers\u201d that reported directly to Jammeh. They say he and his alleged co-conspirators allegedly kicked and beat detainees using pipes and wires, sometimes covering the victims' heads with plastic bags, and also administering electric shocks to their bodies, including their genitals.",
      "His attorneys plan to argue that Correa was coerced to participate and acted under duress, according to court filings. Prosecutors and the defense have agreed that there is information indicating that members of the Junglers who did not carry out Jammeh's orders without question would be killed.",
      "Jammeh was a 22-year dictator of Gambia, a country surrounded by Senegal except for a small Atlantic coastline, and was accused of ordering opponents tortured, jailed and killed. He lost a presidential election and went into exile in Equatorial Guinea in 2017 after initially refusing to step down.",
      "Correa came to the U.S. to serve as a bodyguard for Jammeh in December 2016, but he remained and overstayed his visa after Jammeh was ousted, according to prosecutors. Since sometime after 2016, Correa had been living in Denver and working as a day laborer, they said.",
      "According to Human Rights Watch, Correa is the third person to be tried under a U.S. law that allows people to be charged with committing torture abroad. The two others who have been previously tried were both U.S. citizens and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences.",
      "Charles \u201cChuckie\u201d Taylor, Jr., the son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, was convicted in 2008 in connection with torture committed in Liberia from 1997 to 2003.",
      "In 2023, Ross Roggio of Pennsylvania was convicted of torturing an employee in Iraq while accused of operating an illegal manufacturing plant in Kurdistan.",
      "Other countries have also prosecuted those tied to Jammeh\u2019s regime.",
      "Last year, Jammeh\u2019s former interior minister was sentenced to 20 years behind bars by a Swiss court for crimes against humanity. In 2023, a German court convicted a Gambian man who was also a member of the Junglers of murder and crimes against humanity for involvement in the killing of government critics in Gambia.",

      "A federal judge will hear arguments Tuesday morning in a lawsuit brought by three news organizations that say Idaho prison officials are unconstitutionally hiding parts of lethal injection executions from public view",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal magistrate judge is expected to hear arguments Tuesday morning in a lawsuit brought by three news organizations that say Idaho prison officials are unconstitutionally hiding parts of lethal injection executions from public view.",
      "The Associated Press, East Idaho News and The Idaho Statesman filed the lawsuit against the director of the Idaho Department of Correction in December. They are asking U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham to temporarily stop the state from restricting media witnesses from viewing the actual injection of lethal chemicals in any executions that may occur before the lawsuit is resolved.",
      "Prison officials say there are important safety and security reasons for keeping some details secret, like the source and type of lethal injection drugs and the identities of execution team members.",
      "Former Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt and other prison officials have told lawmakers in the past that anything threatening the confidentiality of execution team members or the source of the state\u2019s execution drugs could put Idaho\u2019s ability to carry out capital punishment at risk, in part because it would be difficult to find qualified volunteers willing to put someone to death.",
      "But the news organizations contend the public has a First Amendment right to witness the entire execution process, including when execution team members push the lethal injection medications into the IV lines connected to a condemned person. Idaho\u2019s prison officials have kept that part of the execution concealed behind screens or walls in each of the three executions completed in the last 50 years.",
      "Media witnesses can already see other execution team members, though their identities are concealed by medical masks and head coverings.",
      "Idaho has attempted four lethal injection executions since the 1970s. Three of them were completed, but the most recent attempt, involving Thomas Eugene Creech, was aborted last year after execution team members were unable to successfully establish an IV line after eight attempts in Creech's arms and legs.",
      "Lawmakers passed a new law this year that will make firing squads the state's primary method of execution, starting next year.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security is telling migrants who entered the country using an online app to leave the United States immediately",
      "MCALLEN, Texas -- Migrants who were temporarily allowed to live in the United States by using a Biden-era online appointment app have been told to leave the country \u201cimmediately,\u201d officials said Monday. It was unclear how many beneficiaries would be affected.",
      "More than 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the CBP One app since January 2023. They were generally allowed to remain in the United States for two years with authorization to work under a presidential authority called parole.",
      "\u201cCanceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security media affairs unit said in response to questions.",
      "Authorities confirmed termination notices were sent to CBP One beneficiaries but did not say how many. They were urged to voluntary self-deport using the same app they entered on, which has been renamed CBP Home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to abandon the United States,\" the Department of Homeland Security wrote to a Honduran family that entered the U.S. at the end of last year. The Associated Press reviewed the email received Sunday.",
      "Others shared the same email on social media platforms.",
      "Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit organization that provides legal aid to migrants, said some who received the revocation letters are from Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico.",
      "CBP One was a cornerstone of the Biden administration's strategy to create and expand legal pathways to enter the United States in an attempt to discourage illegal border crossings. By the end of December, 936,500 people had been allowed to enter with CBP One appointments at border crossings with Mexico. President Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office, stranding thousands in Mexico who had appointments into early February.",
      "Trump has ended and revoked temporary status for many who benefited under Biden\u2019s policies. Homeland Security said Monday that Biden\u2019s use of parole authority \u2014 more than any president since it was created in 1952 \u2014 \u201cfurther fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history.\u201d",
      "Homeland Security said last month that it was revoking another form of parole for 532,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the country at their own expense with a financial sponsor. It ends April 24.",
      "The Trump administration has also announced an end to Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans and about 500,00 Haitians, though a federal judge temporarily put that on hold, including for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had been scheduled to lose TPS on Monday. TPS is granted in 18-month increments to people already in the U.S. whose countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.",

      "STARKE, Fla. -- A man convicted of killing a woman who was carjacked on her lunch break from her job at The Miami Herald is set to be executed on Tuesday evening.",
      "Barring a late reprieve, Michael Tanzi is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison for the April 2000 abduction and strangling of Janet Acosta.",
      "A production worker at the newspaper, the victim was beaten, robbed, driven to the Florida Keys and then strangled and her body left on an island.",
      "Tanzi, 48, would become the third inmate on Florida's death row executed this year, with another lethal injection scheduled on May 1 under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "Court records show the victim was on a break from her job at the newspaper on April 25, 2000. She was sitting in her van reading a book when Tanzi approached her, asked for a cigarette and then began punching her in the face, the records indicate.",
      "\u201cHolding her wrist and threatening her with a razor blade,\u201d court records show, Tanzi drove to Homestead, south of Miami, where he stopped at a gas station and bound and gagged Acosta. He took $53 in cash from her, along with her bank card.",
      "They then went on to the Florida Keys town of Tavernier, where Tanzi used Acosta's bank card to steal money from her account, according to the records. They stopped at a hardware store where Tanzi bought duct tape and razor blades, and then Tanzi decided he had to kill Acosta, they added.",
      "\u201cHe drove to an isolated area in Cudjoe Key, told her he was going to kill her, and began to strangle her,\u201d according to a summary by the state Commission on Capital Cases. \u201cHe stopped to place duct tape over her mouth, nose and eyes in an attempt to quiet her and then strangled her until she expired.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Acosta's friends and co-workers reported her missing when she didn't return from her break. That led police to her van, which Tanzi had driven to Key West. Police said Tanzi confessed to the crime and showed investigators where he had left Acosta's body.",
      "\u201cIf I had let her go, I was gonna get caught quicker,\u201d Tanzi told officers, according to the record. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught. I was having too much fun ... I told her, I says, \u2018I can\u2019t let you go. If I let you go, then I\u2019m gonna be in a lot of trouble.\u2019 \u201d",
      "Tanzi was convicted of first-degree murder, carjacking, kidnapping and armed robbery. A Monroe County jury recommended the death sentence on a 12-0 vote for Acosta's slaying.",
      "Tanzi has filed several appeals, none successful. The Florida Supreme Court recently rejected his claim that he shouldn't be executed because he is \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d and suffers from sciatica, which could cause unconstitutional levels of pain. The court ruled that his appeal was not timely because his conditions had been known since 2009.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, this court has considered and rejected similar arguments based on obesity and IV procedures,\u201d the justices ruled.",
      "Two other convicted killers have been executed in Florida this year. Edward James, 63, was put to death on March 20 for killing an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother during a night of heavy drinking and drug use.",
      "James Dennis Ford, 64, was executed on Feb. 13 for killing a husband and wife at a remote farm in an attack witnessed by the couple\u2019s toddler, who survived the ordeal.",

      "The Philadelphia Police Department piloted its Crisis Intervention Teams on the Behavioral Health Unit a little more than two years ago, as a co-responder program that sends an officer with a mental health clinician or social worker to respond to crise...",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- On a frigid February morning, Vanity Cordero, a Philadelphia police officer, heard a call over the radio for a man threatening to jump from a bridge. The details sounded familiar.",
      "When Cordero arrived, she realized she\u2019d met him months earlier on the same bridge, where she talked him down by engaging him in conversation about his family and bringing him a hot meal.",
      "Cordero is a member of a program focused on de-escalation practices and to provide connections to services including follow-up support as an alternative to arrest and entering into the criminal justice system.",
      "The unit started as a pilot program in late 2022, nearly two years after the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., who was experiencing a mental health episode when police responded to his mother's call for help.",
      "Studies over the past two decades have shown a person with serious mental illness can be over 10 times more likely to experience use of force during police interactions.",
      "In the wake of Wallace's death, the police and the city both invested in programs to better respond to mental health crises \u2014 one of dozens of similar initiatives in other police departments across the country.",
      "What makes Philadelphia's unit unique is the robust follow-up resources and that most of the officers on Philadelphia's team, including Cordero, have personal experiences that made them want to join \u2014 family members with mental illness or addictions or previous work with at-risk populations.",
      "Cordero grew up living with her uncle, who her mother takes care of because of an intellectual disability that today would be diagnosed as autism, she said. She's an advocate for better practices for police interacting with autistic people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the street and I\u2019m serving in the community, I think of someone being my uncle or, you know, any family member. Everyone is a family member to someone,\u201d she said. \u201dIt just gives you a little bit more edge and patience and courteousness to the people that need your help.\"",
      "On this February morning, Cordero rushed to the bridge to help responding patrol officers.",
      "CIRT teams, who drive SUVs without police lights and department decals and wear less formal uniforms, are often requested by other officers to assist, and also choose calls to respond to citywide.",
      "She stayed back until she was needed, but the man spotted her and teased her about not being as tan as she was the last time they saw each other.",
      "They laughed about Cordero getting pale over the winter months and she reminded him it was cold outside, especially on that bridge.",
      "A few hours later, the man was on his way to a mandatory mental health hold and clinician Krystian Gardner would follow up in the coming days and offer resources to the man's family.",
      "A lot of officers on the team said many calls were about mental health when they were on regular patrol. But officers usually have just a few minutes to spend handling calls before being pulled to the next incident.",
      "The CIRT team, however, spends more than an hour on average with each person, said Lt. Victoria Casale, who oversees the unit.",
      "\u201cIn policing, there just isn't the resources or time to spend hours on calls,\u201d Casale said. \u201cBut we want our officers to spend time with people. We're not leaving you. We're trying to solve this problem with you.\u201d",
      "The team's clinicians, who work for the nonprofit Merakey, a behavioral health provider, also bring experience and resources to the table.",
      "Audrey Lundy, program director for Merakey, said one of her first calls with the unit reframed her perspective. Instead of doing a typical welfare check \u2014 on a mother who hadn't been to work in awhile \u2014 Lundy and the CIRT officer brought over groceries for the family using a flexible needs spending card. The woman had gotten sick, was unable to work and began experiencing a financial crisis.",
      "The groceries opened the door to a broader conversation about the resources that may be available to help her cover school costs, long-term expenses and ultimately, get back to her job.",
      "The officers like the idea of being problem solvers. For Officer Kenneth Harper, a Marine combat veteran, his CIRT assignment has given him the opportunity to help fellow veterans having a hard time readjusting to civilian life or dealing with mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cThere was a gentleman that served over 30 years in the Army \u2014 a very decorated, highly respected person,\u201d Harper said. \u201cBut he was very stubborn, never received any help or services.\u201d",
      "Harper and another officer with military experience built a rapport with the man, eventually getting him to the veterans hospital for treatment and help with housing.",
      "\u201cWe kept in touch for months after that, checking in,\u201d he said.",
      "Casale said Harper has gone far above and beyond, even recruiting other veterans in the department to share trainings about trauma responses and resources for vets.",
      "It's just one way the small unit has expanded its reach. The eight-officer CIRT team covers the entire city on weekdays, but crises don't stop on nights and weekends. Casale hopes the team can grow in numbers as districts across the city become familiar with and trust the work they do.",
      "They want people to call CIRT directly if they need help instead of waiting until it's an emergency and calling 911.",
      "\u201cWe want them to call us,\u201d Cordero said, of connecting with the man on the bridge. \u201cI told him, you know, you can call us. We can just go eat. We don\u2019t have to keep meeting on this bridge.\u201d",

Seats in the Democrat-led state House also will be up for election.",

      "The US does not normally see high interest rates on its debt as its bonds are viewed as a safe investment, but on Wednesday rates spiked sharply to touch 4.5%.",
      "The rise came after Trump pressed ahead with sweeping tariffs on goods being imported into the US, while Washington's trade war with China escalated further - although Trump on Wednesday did put a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for some countries.",
      "After the US implemented a 104% tariff on products from China at midnight on Wednesday, Beijing hit back with 84% levy on American products. Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.",
      "Stock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.",
      "However, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.",

      "\"Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,\" he added.",
      "While interest rates on US government debt rose, the price of the bonds themselves fell as demand weakened due to investors offloading them.",
      "Mohammed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former boss of the biggest bond manager Pimco, said one reason US borrowing costs had shot up was because there had been an \"erosion\" of bonds being seen as a safe haven.",
      "He added concerns over the impact of tariffs on inflation and US government budgets were also reasons.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve step in?",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank - the US Federal Reserve -  might be forced to step in if turbulence continues, in a move reminiscent of the Bank of England's emergency action in 2022 following Liz Truss's mini-Budget.",

      "'US recession a coin toss'",
      "JP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.",
      "He said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.",
      "This is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "'US sneezes, UK catches a cold'",
      "Mr El Erian said the UK was likely to be impacted by the US bonds sell-off.",
      "\"When US treasuries sneeze, UK government bonds catch a cold - we have seen a significant move up in UK bond yields which means more pressure on the Budget,\" he added.",
      "Rising UK bond yields means \"higher borrowing costs for companies and households,\" he added.",

    "summary": "US exports have driven the economic success of countries like Vietnam and Cambodia.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.",
      "Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.",
      "This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.",
      "Exports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.",
      "That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.",
      "The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.",
      "As Trump hikes tariffs again, nervous businesses weigh what comes next",
      "China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?",
      "Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.",
      "Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.",
      "Exporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.",
      "It was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.",
      "The Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.",
      "Thailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.",
      "For Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.",
      "The government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.",
      "Keeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.",
      "The garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Unlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.",
      "Vietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours.",
      "However, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.",
      "Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.",
      "He accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.",
      "The proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.",
      "Like Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.",
      "The local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.",
      "Perhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.",
      "US exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.",
      "But as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.",
      "In a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.",
      "He has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.",
      "Only last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.",

And state-linked enterprises have been buying up shares in what appears to be a move to stabilise the market.",
      "The prospect of negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to buoy investors who were fighting to claw back some of the losses of recent days.",
      "But the face-off between China and the US - the world's biggest exporter and its most important market - remains a major concern.",
      "\"What we are seeing is a game of who can bear more pain. We've stopped talking about any sense of gain,\" Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told the BBC's Newshour programme.",
      "Despite its slowing economy, China may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", she added.",
      "Shaken by a prolonged property market crisis and rising unemployment, Chinese people are just not spending enough. Indebted local governments have also been struggling to increase investments or expand the social safety net.",
      "\"The tariffs exacerbate this problem,\" said Andrew Collier, Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "If China's exports take a hit, that hurts a crucial revenue stream. Exports have long been a key factor in China's explosive growth. And they remain a significant driver, although the country is trying to diversify its economy with high-end tech manufacturing and greater domestic consumption.",
      "It's hard to say exactly when the tariffs \"will bite but likely soon,\" Mr Collier says, adding that \"[President Xi] faces an increasingly difficult choice due to a slowing economy and dwindling resources\".",
      "It goes both ways",
      "But it's not just China that will be feeling the impact.",
      "According to the US Trade Representative office, the US imported $438bn (\u00a3342bn) worth of goods from China in 2024, with US exports to China valued at $143bn,  leaving a trade deficit of $295bn.",
      "And it's not clear how the US is going to find alternative supply for Chinese goods on such short notice.",
      "Taxes on physical goods aside, both countries are \"economically intertwined in a lot of ways - there's a massive amount of investment both ways, a lot of digital trade and data flows\", says Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.",
      "\"You can only tariff so much for so long. But there are other ways both countries can hit each other. So you might say it can't possibly get worse, but there are many ways in which it can.\"",
      "The rest of the world is watching too, to see where Chinese exports shut out of the US market will go.",
      "They will end up in other markets such as those in South East Asia, Ms Elms adds, and \"these places [are dealing] with their own tariffs and having to think about where else can we sell our products?\"",
      "\"So we are in a very different universe, one that is really murky.\"",
      "How does this end?",
      "Unlike the trade war with China during Trump's first term, which was about negotiating with Beijing, \"it's unclear what is motivating these tariffs and it's very hard to predict where things might go from here,\" says Roland Rajah, lead economist at the Lowy Institute.",
      "China has a \"wide toolkit\" for retaliation, he adds, such as depreciating their currency further or clamping down on US firms.",
      "\"I think the question is how restrained will they be? There's retaliation to save face and there's pulling out the whole arsenal. It's not clear if China wants to go down that path. It just might.\"",
      "Some experts believe the US and China may engage in private talks. Trump is yet to speak to Xi since returning to the White House, although Beijing has repeatedly signalled its willingness to talk.",
      "But others are less hopeful.",
      "\"I think the US is overplaying its hand,\" Ms Elms says. She is sceptical of Trump's belief that the US market is so lucrative that China, or any country, will eventually bend.",
      "\"How will this end? No-one knows,\" she says. \"I'm really concerned about the speed and escalation. The future is much more challenging and the risks are just so high.\"",

    "summary": "Experts answer your questions on how the stock market index works, whether the markets will recover and more.",
    "story": [
      "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "Experts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.",
      "Read their answers below.",
      "How does a stock market index work?",
      "Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were.",
      "The stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.",
      "It works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon.",
      "The stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.",
      "Generally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.",
      "How does a market downturn affect pensions and daily life?",
      "Jack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same.",
      "Some people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.",
      "The other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you.",
      "There are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.",
      "Pensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game.",
      "The warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.",
      "A lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.",
      "How popular are tariffs in the US?",
      "There is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.",
      "According to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats.",
      "However, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment.",
      "One of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.",
      "Yet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax.",
      "There could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.",
      "How much of this is about China?",
      "Some think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.",
      "But Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods.",
      "The UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways.",
      "And while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.",
      "It is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.",
      "China is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain.",
      "There is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.",
      "Will the markets recover?",
      "That is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility.",
      "We got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam.",
      "The country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.",
      "Broadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed.",
      "We do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Is the world heading into recession?",

      "The government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US.",
      "A ban selling new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, but manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast its changes were not a \"silver bullet\" but part of the solution to responding to US tariffs.",
      "UK opposition parties said Labour's measures would not be enough to boost the car industry.",
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, which is a major export market for the UK motor industry.",
      "It came into force last week and is separate to a 10% tax on nearly all UK products announced by Trump on Wednesday.",
      "A consultation on the government's EV target changes ended in mid-February, but Alexander told the BBC that the government had sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs.",
      "The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously \"strengthen its commitment to the phase out\" while introducing \"practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition\".",
      "Currently, 28% of new cars sold in the UK this year must be electric, a target that will rise each year until 2030.",
      "But manufacturers will now be given more freedom in how they meet their yearly targets - meaning if they don't sell enough EVs in one year, they can make up for it by selling more the next year, for example.",
      "In addition, the fine of \u00a315,000 per vehicle sold that does not meet the latest emissions standards will be cut to \u00a312,000.",
      "Meanwhile, a ban on the sale of hybrid vehicles - which combines a petrol or diesel-powered engine with an electric motor - has been confirmed as from 2035.",
      "Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline",
      "As part of the changes, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Times on Monday that the government is \"putting \u00a32.3bn towards tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure\".",

      "The ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars was extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government, but Labour promised to restore the 2030 deadline in its manifesto for the 2024 election.",
      "Car industry leaders have previously warned that drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and a lack of charging point infrastructure.",
      "Sir Keir said the measures would \"boost growth that puts money in working people's pockets\" and ensure \"home-grown firms\" can export UK-made cars worldwide.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the changes are \"very much needed\".",
      "However, Robert Forrester, chief executive of car dealership chain Vertu Motors, told the BBC said there were \"lots and lots of words in the announcement but it doesn't really address the major issues\".",

    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",

    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",

    "summary": "What's happening in Whitehall to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "After Justin Welby's failures, obscurity is perhaps not his to choose",

      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",
      "But a childcare expert says the rise in the number of reports highlights a \"dire situation\".",
      "\"Standards [of care] are so low that the government surely has an obligation to improve them,\" says Helen Penn, professor of early childhood from the University of East London.",
      "Parents often rely on Ofsted's inspections and subsequent ratings to help them choose the best childcare setting.",
      "Full inspections usually happen every six years, but the regulator can inspect more often if a nursery is graded as inadequate or requiring improvement - or if concerns are raised.",
      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",

      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",

      "In light of our findings from Ofsted about a broad range of incidents, we asked councils across England about the specific number of times harm had been caused to children by nursery workers.",
      "Seventy-two out of more than 150 councils responded to Freedom of Information requests with figures indicating there had been 5,795 reports or allegations of children being harmed by nursery workers, over a five-year period between 2019 and 2024.",
      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",

      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "But a legal challenge to the policy has been taken to the High Court, with some families and schools claiming it is discriminatory and in breach of human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",

      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by three groups: the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argued that the policy goes against the legal right to an education.",

      "But the government said the main objective of the VAT policy is to raise additional tax revenue so they can raise standards for the 94% of children who attend state schools.",
      "Their lawyers argued that those who wish to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" are free to choose any private education for their child that they can afford, or to educate their child at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider whether it would amend the policy, but it would be under no obligation to do so.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",

      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",

      "Renowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch.",

      "\"Hopefully [it will run and run]. Selfishly, it's a fun job,\" he says. \"Technology is developing in the real world very quickly.",

      "The Crown and Deadpool & Wolverine actor Emma Corrin, who stars in one of this season's episodes, adds: \"It's much closer to home. People have access to stuff like AI which is terrifying so then it's more confronting and serves as a better warning.\"",

      "\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"",
      "Without giving too much away, AI - the subject of much debate in the creative industries - rears its head in the storyline.",
      "Corrin says they don't \"feel great\" about its potential impact on their profession.",
      "\"Obviously, I think it's scary, but it's also a massive conversation, right? There are aspects of it that are terrifying to me as an artist. I love the creative process. I love that this art is born out of being in a room with people and things coming from the depths of someone's human experience or imagination. And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not.",
      "\"And I think there are also aspects of AI I probably don't understand, and that could be used as tools for good. It's about everyone being able to understand them and to use them correctly, and them being in the right hands.\"",
      "Brooker agrees: \"Quite rightly, when Andy Serkis played Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings trilogy], everyone's amazed by that, but what you're amazed by is the human, you're seeing a human performance shining through.",
      "\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"",
      "Brooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.",
      "Remember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.",
      "Scottish actor Lewis Gribben, who is soon to star in the highly anticipated TV series Blade Runner 2099, plays 1990s games journalist and loner Cameron, who becomes obsessed with one particular game featuring little pixel creatures. (Brooker himself was a games journalist back in the day.)",
      "Former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi also turns in a brilliantly disturbing performance as an older Cameron.",
      "Although a big Black Mirror fan, Gribben hadn't seen Bandersnatch but says that coming to Plaything fresh actually aided his performance.",
      "\"I think it made it easier for me... but I was just intimidated. I was like 'Oh my god, it's Will Poulter who I've watched since I was seven years old acting in Son of Rambow. And Asim Chowdhury from People Just Do Nothing!\"",
      "Gribben tells the BBC he's a bit of a gamer himself but has more of a handle on it than his Black Mirror character.",

    "summary": "The artist opens a major exhibition in Paris, but the 87-year-old feared he wouldn\u2019t make it.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take long to make David Hockney laugh.",
      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former colleague of Dan Wootton was tricked by the journalist and broadcaster into sending intimate pictures and an explicit video of himself, according to a case lodged at the High Court.",
      "A hearing on Tuesday heard that Mr Wootton pretended to be a woman, using the name \"Maria Joseph\", in online messages with the man who has brought this case, who can't be named.",
      "In written submissions, the individual's barrister Justin Levinson told the court that Mr Wootton sent the man partially and naked photographs of a woman, as well as a video of a couple having sex, in 2010.",
      "Mr Levinson said the man had been deceived by Mr Wootton into believing he had been exchanging messages with the woman in the images.",
      "The hearing heard that as a result, the man thought he was talking to a woman who was interested in a sexual relationship, and that as a result he sent intimate photographs and a video of himself carrying out a sex act.",
      "Mr Levinson told the court that Mr Wootton had \"tricked the claimant into providing these images\".",
      "The man subsequently became aware that \"Maria Joseph\" did not exist, and that he had in fact sent the images to Mr Wootton.",
      "The man has now brought a claim against the former Sun and GB News journalist, alleging he had been the victim of \"obtaining sexual images\" by deceit, and that it resulted in him \"suffering injury (including psychiatric injury)\".",
      "The case is at an early stage and Mr Wootton has not yet filed a defence to the claim.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Mr Wootton asked the court to allow the man to be named publicly.",
      "Mr Wootton's barrister Samuel Rowe argued that when a court order was made earlier this year granting the man anonymity, Mr Wootton was not given sufficient notice to be able to challenge it in court.",
      "This was rejected by Judge Roger Eastman.",
      "Mr Rowe also argued that if the court had been told some relevant information, it would have been justified in not granting the order.",
      "Mr Rowe said these matters included the fact that Mr Wootton had been investigated by the Metropolitan Police and Police Scotland in connection with the allegation that he used fake online identities to obtain explicit images without consent, and that both forces had concluded that no further action would be taken and ended their investigations.",
      "Mr Levinson told the court that as far as he was aware, those investigations did not relate to the claimant's complaint, but to similar ones.",
      "The judge again said those issues were no reason for lifting the anonymity order.",
      "In addition, Mr Rowe argued that granting anonymity offended the principle of open justice.",
      "The judge rejected that argument and said there was \"clear evidence of potential adverse and seriously adverse effects on the claimant if the claimant's name being in the public domain in this case\"."

    "story": [
      "Lily has loved acting since she was a young girl and hoped that tuition from Sex Education actor Alexander Westwood would help her pursue her dream of becoming an actress.",
      "Instead, Westwood's lessons were the start of the darkest period of her life.",
      "Westwood, from Albrighton in Shropshire, used the lessons to inflict a torrent of abuse on the 16-year-old - raping her, sexually assaulting her, and inciting her to engage in sexual activity.",
      "Lily, 20, - whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity - was one of several of Westwood's victims. In February, he was jailed for 15 and a half years for a horrifying catalogue of abuse against five victims, but the BBC is aware of two women whose charges were dropped before they could get to court.",
      "Speaking to the BBC for the first time, Lily shares her story, speaking about the horrific abuse from someone she should have been able to trust, and how it has shaped the rest of her life.",
      "Warning: Some people may find details in this story distressing.",
      "Lily wanted to go to acting college. Westwood told her mother that he could help her and offered to tutor Lily.",
      "The first two acting sessions were completely normal. She learnt about the acting industry, the process of auditioning, and how to prepare monologues. But the third session was different.",
      "\"That's when everything started to go downhill,\" Lily said. \"He started to do stuff to me.\"",
      "Over a period of 10 months, Westwood abused Lily during their so-called lessons. He made her strip while performing one of Ophelia's monologues in Hamlet. He touched her, as well as himself, and raped her on several occasions.",
      "Lily said she had to live with the fact that she lost her virginity to an act of rape.",
      "It took 10 months for Lily to muster the courage to tell her mother about what was going on behind closed doors.",
      "\"I was a scared 16-year-old,\" she said. \"It's a very hard subject to actually talk about to your mum - because every time I really wanted to tell her, it was just like, how do you actually tell your mother what's been happening to you?",
      "\"And there were many occasions I really wanted to tell her, 'mum, this is happening to me' - but it just felt like an apple choking in my throat.\"",
      "Feeling completely alone and terrified, Lily started doing anything she could think of to get out of Westwood's lessons.",
      "\"It got to the point where I was actually making myself throw up,\" Lily said.",
      "\"I made myself eat lots of raw cookie dough so I could vomit. I forced my fingers into my mouth and took medications.\"",
      "However, whenever Lily missed a session, Westwood would call her mother, asking where she was.",
      "When she asked her daughter why she didn't want to attend the sessions anymore, Lily could not bear to tell her mother the truth and instead said she no longer wanted to do acting.",
      "Knowing why his victim did not want to come to his lessons, Westwood refused to let her slide out of his grip and ensnared her into a contract.",
      "He told her this obliged her to complete 365 lessons with him, or she would have to pay him up to \u00a336,000.",
      "So Lily kept silent, until after 10 months of abuse, while watching a Netflix show one evening with her mother, Lily started to get an anxiety attack.",
      "While crying, she told her mother she had to tell her something.",
      "Telling her why she hadn't been able to speak to her about it before, she said: \"Because I know I'm going to be breaking your heart.\"",
      "The impact of Westwood's abuse on Lily has been profound. It fuelled a hatred for her own body, leading her to struggle to even go to the toilet.",
      "\"When I have to touch myself there, I just [get] toilet paper and quickly do it,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't even take showers anymore. I take showers, but it's like hateful. I hate my body.",
      "\"It goes to the point where I can't even put in a tampon.\"",
      "She wore oversized clothing and struggled with what she believed to be an eating disorder.",
      "\"I had days where I didn't want to eat because I didn't deserve to eat,\" she said.",
      "Speaking about one extreme moment, Lily told the BBC: \"One time I burnt my skin on purpose. There's literally still a mark on my skin here where I burnt myself. I tried to get rid of the skin that was dirty.",
      "\"He [was living life to] his fullest, while I was literally burning my skin.\"",
      "Lily's lifelong love of acting was also blown to pieces by the shattering abuse. She told her teachers she wanted to change subjects but was told she had too much passion and talent for the subject.",
      "\"I had to fall back in love with drama and acting. I literally got into a panic attack doing a stupid monologue - crying, panicking. I was shaken,\" she said.",
      "\"I couldn't work with male actors. I couldn't do any of the performances. I was scared. I was actually scared someone was going to abuse me.\"",
      "The abuse has also affected her ability to trust people.",
      "\"I will never trust people to the full extent, and I won't lie, there are some days when I don't even want to have my own family,\" she said.",
      "It has affected her ability to be intimate with men, and she worries about having to tell any future partners about the ordeal she has been through.",
      "After Lily confided in her mother, they went to the police, but the case was closed due to a lack of evidence. Around two years later, the case was reopened, with the police aware of several victims.",
      "Despite charges being made against Westwood, he remained out on bail - something that caused a lot of grief and anger for his victims, with Lily calling it \"disgusting\" - until the week before he was sentenced, having been caught breaking his bail conditions.",
      "He was described in court as \"manipulative and predatory\", and jurors were told his repeated offending against five victims was \"a habit, a lifestyle\".",
      "Sentencing Westwood at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Judge Neil Chawla said: \"You used your minor celebrity status as an actor to prey on impressionable, innocent,  and naive young girls.\"",
      "Throughout the trial, the judge described his \"seemingly nonchalant attitude\", which \"seems to border on arrogance at times\".",
      "Westwood is now behind bars after being given a jail sentence of 15 and a half years, but for Lily and his other victims, no sentence could ever be enough.",
      "But Lily has worked hard to put her life back together. She wants to create political theatre, using comedy in her work. She has a stronger bond with her mum than ever before and now has \"true friends\".",
      "One of the only positive things to come out of her ordeal has been the bond she has formed with other victims of Westwood, who even had a day out at the pub on International Women's Day.",
      "\"For me, it's like a new family,\" Lily said.",
      "\"It's like a family that will never judge you; it'll be a family that'll be there for you no matter what.",

      "With its celebrity managers, high-tempo matches and slick production, Baller League could bridge the gap between sport and entertainment one player says - even if some of the new rules are \"nonsense\".",
      "The new six-a-side tournament, fronted by YouTuber KSI, is shaking up the game with 15-minute halves, a 3 vs 3 format in the closing minutes and no corner kicks.",
      "It's that last rule ex-Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe, who's now up front for John Terry's 26ers side, grapples with the most, saying corners should be left \"as God intended\".",
      "In these games, if the ball goes behind off the opposition three times, a penalty is awarded to the attacking team.",
      "But while the shift from the Premier League takes some getting used to, Ibe tells BBC Newsbeat he's impressed with the new format which can \"100%\" bring sport and entertainment closer together.",
      "\"It grabs the eye more,\" he says after Monday's leg of the tournament at Copper Box Arena, London, which saw his side draw 3-3 against streetwear icon Clint's FC RTW.",
      "\"People might not be into sports period, but they might come to this because they'll think a 90-minute game is a bit too long.",
      "\"This has got the challenges in the game and it's only 30 minutes so people get invested in it.\"",
      "'It gives me my purpose back'",
      "Baller League, which started in Germany in 2023 before expanding to the UK this year, sees a mix of former pros, released academy players, free agents and influencers competing on smaller indoor pitches.",
      "The 12 teams also have some pretty well-known managers including rapper Dave, YouTuber Angry Ginge and England legend Gary Lineker.",
      "YouTuber Chunkz also hosts a weekly show where celebrities and other stars from the world of football drop in.",
      "More than 650k viewers streamed Monday's games on Twitch.",

      "The 29-year-old scored during his Old Trafford debut in 2017 - his only appearance for the club.",
      "Since then, he has spent a lot of time off the pitch due to injuries.",
      "After leaving Northampton at the end of last season, he became a free agent until making a deal with Cheltenham Town in January.",

    "summary": "The Liverpool actor on the new BBC drama that conflicts a life of crime with love and vulnerability.",
    "story": [
      "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.",
      "So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.",
      "Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.",
      "Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.",
      "It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date.",
      "\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.",
      "\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\"",
      "He believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".",
      "\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.",
      "\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"",
      "The rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.",
      "And he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.",
      "He says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".",
      "Graham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.",
      "This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.",
      "'Superb crime thriller'",
      "The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".",
      "In a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".",
      "The Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"",
      "But the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".",
      "The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".",
      "\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.",
      "Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"",
      "\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.",
      "Former engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.",
      "Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).",
      "\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",
      "\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"",
      "He says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.",
      "As for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.",
      "\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.",
      "\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.",
      "Both underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.",
      "\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.",
      "He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".",
      "The reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.",
      "\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"",
      "His celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".",

    "story": [
      "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?",
      "Listen to Daniela read this article",
      "\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.",
      "As an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.",
      "When I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.",
      "Seven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\"",
      "Only not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)",
      "Her recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either.",
      "Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).",
      "This was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.",
      "Now, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.",
      "And, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative?",
      "Or could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?",
      "Five years on: Megxit's lingering impact",
      "It has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.",
      "As the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.",
      "The printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.",
      "It was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.",
      "Someone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".",
      "The friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.",
      "According to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"",
      "Mark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\"",
      "There have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.",
      "One source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".",
      "With that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\"",
      "Much of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"",
      "'An unerring instinct for getting it wrong'",
      "Early indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.",
      "Some critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\".",
      "On the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"",
      "Other criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.",
      "\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".",
      "Royal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran.",
      "\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"",
      "And yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.",
      "And there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford.",
      "\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"",
      "The benefits of the Marmite effect",
      "With Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair.",
      "\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"",
      "What's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to.",
      "Existing Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing.",
      "\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.",
      "The wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note.",
      "\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"",
      "Likewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.",
      "In an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.",
      "It was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.",
      "At home with the Sussexes",
      "Away from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.",
      "Meghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.",
      "When the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.",
      "\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"",
      "Yet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.",
      "\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.",
      "More recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission.",
      "Insiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.",
      "But though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.",
      "'A spare to his wife'?",
      "The question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"",
      "Mr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.",
      "\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"",
      "However their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"",
      "With a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"",
      "And yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals.",
      "\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"",
      "What that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)",
      "\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.",
      "But Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals.",
      "\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.",
      "\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"",

      "It comes nearly a year after the final report was published into the scandal - said to be the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.",
      "More than 30,000 people contracted HIV and hepatitis from contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 and 3,000 people have since died.",
      "Victims groups have since said the government has been slow to pay out compensation and the process was lacking transparency. Inquiry chair Sir Brian Langstaff said he had decided to act given the \"gravity\" of the problems expressed.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "The government said it was \"fully-committed\" to cooperating with the inquiry.",

      "When Sir Brian's final report was published last May, the then Conservative government responded immediately setting out a new compensation scheme.",
      "While some victims had received payments previously, the new compensation scheme increased the amount they could be paid and made compensation available to a much wider group of people, including to the family and loved-ones of those who were infected.",
      "A new organisation, the Infected Blood Compensation Authority, was set up to oversee the scheme with nearly \u00a312 billion set aside for payments.",
      "The first payments were made late last year, but by mid March just 40 payouts had been agreed. The government has given itself until the end of 2029 to make payments.",
      "Anger",
      "In evidence sent to the inquiry, victims and their lawyers criticised the length of time it was taking and described \"shambolic\" and \"chaotic\" meetings, with problems starting before and continuing after July's election.",

    "summary": "The US president vows \"major\" tariffs on imported medicines - raising fears of an increase in costs for Americans.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce \"major\" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines.",
      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",
      "In 2024, the US imported $213bn (\u00a3168bn) worth of medicines - more than two and a half times the total a decade earlier.",
      "While short on detail, his comments have rattled buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports. India supplies nearly half of all US generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs, saving the country billions in healthcare costs.",

      "Indian pharma stocks fell sharply on the news. India sends about a third of its $13bn annual pharma exports to the US, which is a key market.",
      "At the moment, Americans pay little or no tax on imports of Indian medicines - compared with the duty of nearly 11% paid by Indians importing American medicines.",
      "Indian drugmakers warn that tariffs would force them to raise prices, which could ultimately drive up US medical bills. While firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's have US plants, most say moving production is not viable for low-margin generic drugs.",
      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",
      "In 2024, pharmaceuticals were the EU's largest export to the US, worth a reported $127bn (\u00a3100bn).",
      "Major companies have urged the EU to act swiftly, seeking policy changes to enhance Europe's competitiveness and prevent a \"mass exodus\" to the US. They have also expressed concerns about potential EU retaliatory tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and affect patients on both sides of the Atlantic.",

    "story": [
      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the \"broken\" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low.",
      "Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every \u00a3100 spent on community care would otherwise cost \u00a3131 for hospital care.",
      "This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service.",
      "Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof.",
      "The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support.",
      "In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.",
      "The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital.",
      "\"We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,\" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. \"The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own \u2013 it requires partnership working.\"",
      "Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a \"pioneering service\" and he is firm that the model could \"be the future of the NHS\".",
      "However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale.",
      "A model system to unblock beds?",
      "In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out.",
      "One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes.",
      "The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home.",
      "\"Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,\" says nurse Dani Fullerton. \"It's so different from anything I have done before.\"",
      "Tackling loneliness to save money",
      "One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers.",
      "Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than \u00a39,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity.",
      "So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too.",
      "\"We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,\" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled.",
      "\"The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks.\"",
      "Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding.",
      "At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand.",
      "Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour.",
      "\"Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually.\"",
      "Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months.",
      "\"It meant we had more time for other patients,\" says Dr Suleman. \"We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it.\"",
      "In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%.",
      "However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city.",
      "The knock-on effect for hospitals",
      "The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions.",
      "So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job.",
      "Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service.",
      "This, he says, worked far better for him. \"I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns.\"",
      "Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. \"Here we can see and test patients quickly \u2013 there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results.\"",
      "But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital.",
      "Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds.",
      "The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people.",
      "Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic.",
      "There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than \u00a3100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff.",
      "Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. \"We believe this is the right model,\" he insists.",
      "But there is a catch. As he puts it, \"It only works when the whole system buys into it.\"",
      "Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector",
      "Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder.",
      "\"People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,\" she says.",
      "But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources.",
      "The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, \"been a bit cynical\". \"The problem is that it takes time to get results \u2013 you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact.\"",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures",
      "Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not.",
      "This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs.",
      "\"There just isn't enough of the right premises,\" he argues. \"In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped.",
      "\"We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?\"",
      "Political pressure and short-term thinking",
      "There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge.",
      "Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007.",
      "Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. \"We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale.\"",
      "And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first.",
      "Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets.",
      "\"It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,\" he observes.",
      "So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic.",
      "\"It can,\" he says. \"But it will take determination, effort \u2013 and money.\"",

    "summary": "Jonathan Peter Brooks tried to manipulate the forensic process, prison staff and the courts, a judge says.",
    "story": [
      "More than four years after he stabbed his colleague, plastic surgeon Jonathan Peter Brooks has been found guilty of attempted murder.",
      "On Monday, the 61-year-old was convicted over the 14 January 2021 attack on Graeme Perks in Halam, Nottinghamshire, which a court in Loughborough heard could easily have been fatal.",
      "It can now be reported that Brooks was never seen by the jury, repeatedly refusing to engage with the trial.",
      "In a legal saga stretching from his arrest, during a coronavirus lockdown, to his conviction, a judge outlined the \"extraordinary\" case, labelling Brooks a \"highly intelligent\" man who used hunger strikes and sacking his lawyers as tactics to try to manipulate the system to avoid justice.",
      "Why did the trial take so long?",
      "Brooks was arrested on the day of the attack, and appeared in court four days later.",
      "He dressed in camouflage gear and went to Mr Perks's home equipped with petrol, matches, a lighter, knife and a crowbar, but insisted all the items had been \"stored in his garage and had been acquired for innocent purposes\".",
      "His trial was told he smashed conservatory doors to spread petrol around the ground floor of Mr Perks's house, and then stabbed him in the abdomen.",
      "Brooks was facing an online NHS disciplinary hearing, which started on 11 January 2021.",
      "The court heard the burns specialist \"hated\" Mr Perks, who was a witness against him in those disciplinary proceedings.",
      "A trial originally began in July 2022, but the jury was discharged the following month after Brooks was admitted to hospital, suffering osteoradionecrosis - a medical complication of radiotherapy, which required surgery.",
      "This set in train a long chain of legal delays, with numerous occasions when hearings were listed but Brooks refused to turn up, forcing his case to be relisted and impacting on other court hearings - as barristers and judges had to move around their workloads.",
      "The trial has been listed on \"no fewer than nine occasions\", and the latest got under way despite Brooks sacking his then legal team with one day to go - the fifth time Brooks had dismissed one or more of his lawyers.",
      "Brooks had also embarked on a hunger strike 11 days before his trial was scheduled to start.",
      "Judge Edward Pepperall said this was not new.",
      "\"I identified no fewer than eight occasions since his arrest in 2021 when Dr Brooks had used hunger strikes or the threat of some other self-harm to achieve some advantage whether within the prison estate or in hospital,\" he said.",
      "Why was Brooks not co-operating?",
      "Brooks claimed he was not medically fit to stand trial, that accommodations were not being made in order for him to attend trial, and that the trial was unfair.",
      "By the time another trial was due to take place, he was left in the unusual position of acting as his own legal counsel.",
      "The dangers of defendants representing themselves without legal support are well-documented, and with Brooks also indicating a refusal to engage - while repeatedly claiming he would rather die than be wrongfully convicted - the court was faced with trying to arrange a trial in which an unrepresented defendant was not likely to turn up.",
      "Combined with Brooks's hunger strike, it presented the possibility that even if he was fit at the start of the trial, his condition could deteriorate during the weeks it was scheduled to run, and could mean a second trial would not reach a conclusion.",
      "Were allowances made for Brooks?",
      "In short, yes.",
      "The hunger strike meant the defendant had become increasingly weak, which led to the case being moved to Loughborough due to the defendant's new requirement for a wheelchair, something the original court could not accommodate.",
      "On 3 March this year, he did not appear for the slated start date, and the prosecution asked to continue the trial in the defendant's absence.",
      "Judge Pepperall came to a decision about whether it was fair for the trial to go ahead, with his ruling made on 6 March, a copy of which was sent to the defendant.",
      "In the 30-page document, he addressed the concerns prompted by Brooks going on hunger strike, and set out how he would ensure any trial would be fair.",
      "\"It is not too late for [Brooks] to change course and let the court know that he wishes to attend his trial... that he has already stopped his hunger strike, and that he is accepting all reasonable treatment so that he can in time recover sufficient health to put his case to the jury,\" he said.",
      "What happened during the trial?",
      "Tracy Ayling KC led the prosecution case against Brooks, who remained absent while also acting as his own legal representation.",
      "The situation was explained by Judge Pepperall to the jury, when he warned them not to take the defendant's absence as any sign of guilt.",
      "Evidence was then heard in the usual way, but on 11 March the judge said he had received a letter from Brooks, who was being held at HMP Bedford, in which he further objected to the trial continuing without him.",
      "A three-page response gave short shrift to Brooks's latest protests.",
      "\"Dr Brooks cannot refuse to engage with both the court and his lawyers, and then complain that he was not properly kept updated as to his case,\" he said.",
      "The trial continued, and on 24 March Stephen Leslie KC was brought in to cross-examine Mr Perks - a measure made to provide balance to the prosecution case.",
      "On 25 March, a new five-page ruling was made to allow Brooks to appear via video-link from prison should he so wish, rather than go in person.",
      "In the ruling, the judge spoke of Brooks's \"sporadic\" engagement.",
      "\"On no fewer than 13 occasions, he has declined to attend court, sometimes even when only required to appear by prison link, without good reason,\" he said.",
      "Addressing the behaviour of the defendant, the judge added: \"Dr Brooks has deliberately made himself ill in order to seek to manipulate the court process and prevent his trial from proceeding. Such conduct was the voluntary decision of a well-informed medical man with capacity.\"",
      "Following the ruling, the defendant continued to complain about his condition and the trial, and after assessment from doctors confirmed he was fit to attend but remained absent through his own choice, the prosecution case concluded.",
      "During a debate on Brooks's fitness during the trial, Ms Ayling said her prosecution team \"has anticipated\" such requests being made by the defendant.",
      "\"Yet again he's attempting to put off the trial,\" she said. \"He is deliberately manipulating the court and voluntarily absenting himself.\"",
      "Brooks did not turn up for his own defence, which was scheduled for 27 March, but on 1 April he finally made an appearance, addressing the trial in the absence of the jury via video-link from HMP Norwich, where he had recently been transferred.",
      "He requested a four-week adjournment so he could prepare his case, but he refused the offer of a 48-hour extension, ending up in tears as he said he felt he could not accept the judge's offers to accommodate a late speech from him.",
      "By the time the jury was brought in that day, Brooks had gone back to his cell, and so he was once again absent when the judge summed up the evidence.",
      "What can the courts do with defendants who will not engage?",
      "The criminal justice system stresses the importance of not only there being a fair trial, but there being seen to be a fair trial, so even though Brooks refused to co-operate, measures were taken to ensure due process was followed.",
      "For Brooks, a lawyer was brought in to challenge witness evidence, and while legal rulings were not discussed in front of the jury in order to avoid prejudicing their views, they were discussed before the press, so the legal discussions could be reported after trial.",
      "Ultimately, courts have to give the opportunity for defendants to appear, and if they refuse they must ensure the process is still fair, even if that leads to long delays.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service said the trial \"was extremely unusual\".",
      "\"The lack of participation meant that straightforward and non-controversial evidence could not be agreed as would usually happen when a defendant is present and represented,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"This meant that some witnesses had to give evidence to the jury and have statements read out in full that would otherwise have been treated as agreed facts.\"",
      "A number of recent sentencings - including Kyle Clifford and Axel Rudakubana - saw defendants refuse to appear, and as a result the prime minister has promised to give judges the power to make criminals appear in the dock.",
      "Judge Pepperall said that he would write to the governor of HMP Norwich, where Brooks is currently held, to request that he attend in person for his sentencing hearing, which is due to be held on 3 June.",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

      "She said after a series of relapses and months of treatment over the course of last year, she had received a stem cell transplant in December and had been declared cancer-free.",

      "She later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward.",
      "Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites.",
      "Out of the blue",
      "A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England.",
      "Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time.",
      "After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives \u2013 close or distant.",
      "Six years later she received a message out of the blue.",
      "The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling.",
      "\"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says.",
      "Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.",
      "He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.",
      "Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.",
      "Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.",
      "The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.",
      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",
      "Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.",
      "The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.",
      "In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.",
      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",
      "From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.",
      "This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades.",
      "She grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role.",
      "Other than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\".",
      "\"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\"",
      "If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\".",
      "\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.",
      "On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.",
      "\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.",
      "\"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\"",
      "She remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\".",
      "As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult.",
      "She has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked.",
      "\"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes.",
      "She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.",
      "But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy.",
      "\"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says.",
      "\"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\"",
      "Susan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother.",
      "\"I'd still like to know a bit more about her \u2013 what she was like and all that \u2013 but I never will, so there you go,\" she says.",
      "\"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\"",
      "Historic mistake",
      "Susan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this.",
      "She needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology.",
      "Last year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas.",
      "Susan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago.",
      "\"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks.",

    "story": [
      "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.",
      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",
      "\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"",

      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",

      "The prime minister joked that his children, aged 14 and 16, were uncharacteristically interested in the news.",
      "\"They don't take that much interest in the announcements I'm making every day, I have to admit, but this one has really caught their eye,\" said Starmer, speaking on a visit to Kimberley College in nearby Stewartby.",

      "In the open letter, the Labour MPs said \"this government will only succeed if it is able to get a grip on illegal migration\".",
      "A key part of this, the letter said, \"must be tackling illegal off-the-books employment, which is a major draw for migrants entering our country unlawfully\".",

    "summary": "The move could see some taxpayer-funded organisations not directly controlled by ministers scrapped.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of public bodies are to be reviewed in a bid to cut spending and give ministers more decision-making powers.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has written to government departments asking them to justify the existence of every taxpayer-funded organisation not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "Some of these organisations, known as quangos, could be closed, merged, or have their responsibilities handed over to departments.",
      "The BBC has been told ministers are considering passing a new law that would make it easier to scrap multiple quangos at once.",
      "A government source said the review had no completion date, and ministers had not set a target for how many quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, they wanted to abolish.",
      "The source said the review be particularly focused on quangos dealing with policy issues of national importance.",
      "The review comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to abolish NHS England, which Labour has described as the world's biggest quango.",
      "The organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "The move is part of the government's drive to slim down the Civil Service, with a view to saving money and restructuring how the state works.",
      "Last month, Sir Keir told his ministers they should take more responsibility for decisions rather than \"outsourcing\" them to regulators.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Abolishing NHS England is radical - why do it?",
      "Quangos are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",
      "The Cabinet Office's review will consider four key principles, including the importance of ministerial oversight of key policy areas and government efficiency.",
      "There will be a presumption that all quangos could be scrapped unless there is a compelling reason to keep them, the Cabinet Office said.",
      "But some quangos that scrutinise the government or protect the rule of law will remain unaffected.",
      "McFadden said the government wants to \"ensure decisions of national importance that affect everyone in this country are made by those who have been elected to do so\".",
      "He added: \"The review will aim to drive out waste and inefficiency across Whitehall, reducing duplication and bureaucracy - saving the taxpayer money and cutting the cost of 'doing government'.\"",
      "'Handle it properly'",
      "Since Labour won the general election last year, government has set up a number of new quangos, including Great British Energy, which invests in clean power sources.",
      "Previous governments have taken an axe to these organisations, with the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition getting rid of hundreds in a so-called bonfire of quangos from 2010.",
      "But trade unions are wary of further cuts, and fear they could mean jobs losses in the Civil Service.",
      "\"If they target up to 50% job cuts - as they are pursuing with the NHS England and DHSC merger \u2013 the government seriously risks undermining their own agenda,\" said Lucille Thirlby, assistant general secretary of the FDA, a union representing senior civil servants.",
      "Fran Heathcote, boss of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants below the senior rank, said ministers \"must ensure that there is proper engagement with the unions\".",
      "She said: \"If these changes are to be a success, our members will obviously need guarantees on their job security and pay and conditions.",
      "\"This is a big opportunity to change the civil service for the better and the government must handle it properly.\""

      "\"I want to make sure that the views and voices of disabled people are at the heart of what we do in this area, [as well] as elsewhere across the government.\"",
      "The Spring Statement, announced in March, outlined that a benefit shake-up to make savings of \u00a35bn would include tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payment, a non-means tested benefit to support people with everyday tasks. It also outlined that people under the age of 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.",
      "Fazilet Hadi, head of policy at Disability Rights UK, a DDPO, said there was an \"anger and sense of betrayal\" felt by millions of disabled people over the cuts which she described as \"the Government's massive attack on the incomes of disabled people\".",
      "Ms Hadi said: \"Currently, Disability Rights UK, continues to have dialogue with ministers, as we believe it is important to express the depth of opposition to government plans.",
      "\"Having said this, we will reconsider our position, should the wider disabled people's movement decide to take a different stance.\"",
      "Svetlana Kotova, director of campaigns and justice at Inclusion London, another DDPO, said it was also \"considering its position on engagement\".",
      "She said: \"Massive cuts to financial support will push disabled people, including children, into poverty, the government is not even consulting on the most significant cuts\"",
      "Suspended Labour MP, John McDonnell, who represents Hayes and Harlington in Parliament and previously held the position of shadow chancellor, also told Access All of his \"shock and anger\" at the plans, and said he was \"praying\" for a government U-turn.",
      "Initially, the government's reforms to benefits were intended to make savings of \u00a35bn a year by 2030, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised government figures, projecting a lower net saving of \u00a33.4bn.",
      "The government says that without radical reforms to the benefit system it could cost the tax payer as much as \u00a370bn annually by the end of the decade.",
      "To make savings, other planned changes include freezing extra payments for existing claimants of Universal Credit and almost halving them for new applicants.",
      "The government says some of the money saved will be reinvested into work programmes targeting youth unemployment.",
      "Alongside the 12-week consultation, which ends on 30 June, the government has announced the formation of \"collaboration committees\" which will involve civil servants working with disability experts and those with lived experience to  \"provide discussion, challenge, and recommendations\" to inform government proposals.",

      "Speaking on the Kuenssberg programme, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that retaliatory tariffs were not a solution because they would only harm UK consumers.",
      "However, she said she did not agree that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only \"fragmentation\", adding \"we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries\".",

      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",

      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",

      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",

      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",

      "Badenoch told the BBC that Israel had a right to \"control its borders\", adding it was \"very significant\" there were Labour MPs other countries did not want to let in.",

      "The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to \"document the security forces\".",
      "Badenoch first made her comments when asked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show whether Israel was entitled to refuse entry to the MPs.",
      "\"Countries should be able to control their borders,\" she said. \"What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour who other countries will not allow through, I think that's very significant.\"",
      "She continued: \"I believe that the people who represent us in Parliament should be people who should be able to go anywhere in the world and people not be worried about what they're going to do when they go into those countries.\"",
      "Badenoch said the reason given by the Israelis was that \"they don't believe that they're going to comply with their laws\" and \"there are many people that we don't allow into our country and I don't think we should be setting precedents in a different way\".",
      "Tagging a video of the Conservative leader's comments on X, Lammy posted: \"It's disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs.",
      "\"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?",
      "\"This government will continue to stand up for the rights of our MPs to speak their mind, whatever their party.\"",
      "Reposting the criticism, Badenoch said: \"Unlike China, Israel is our ally and a democracy. A good Foreign Sec would be able to make that distinction.",
      "\"Perhaps Labour MPs could put UK national interest first and do their jobs instead of campaigning for airports in Kashmir or promoting Hamas propaganda in parliament.\"",
      "Further criticism came from Davey on X, who posted: \"Kemi Badenoch has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel.",
      "\"Yet another complete shocker.\"",
      "Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Dame Emily Thornberry told Sky News she was \"completely gobsmacked\" by Badenoch's comments.",
      "\"This is nonsense,\" the Labour MP said. \"You have to stand up for what's right, Kemi Badenoch, and you should stand in solidarity with other parliamentarians who were just going to Israel and the West Bank to find out what was going on.\"",
      "Badenoch was also contradicted by Tory MP Fuller, who told LBC that Conservative MPs had experienced similar issues in China and he wanted to support the right to travel to other countries.",
      "\"I want to support my colleagues,\" said Fuller. \"This isn't a partisan thing, as a parliamentarian, we live in a difficult world at the moment.",
      "\"Democracies are under threat, we should support them in those circumstances, whether China, Israel, or anywhere...",
      "\"On this, my personal view is, parliamentarians should be allowed free passage to other countries, to our allies. We should look at that in a poor light. We should be supporting them.\"",

      "Ms Ghey's child Brianna, 16, was murdered in February 2023 by two 15-year-olds, one of whom had been watching violent content online. Brianna herself had viewed material that encouraged self-harm.",
      "Her comments came amid reports that the Online Safety Bill - part of which came into force in March - could be watered down in a bid to secure favourable trade terms with US President Donald Trump, a suggestion Ms Ghey described as \"shocking\".",
      "A government minister said the protections already in law were \"not up for negotiation\".",

      "The pair had a fascination with violence, torture and murder, and had planned the killing for weeks using a messaging app.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Ms Ghey said of the Online Safety Bill: \"While we are... questioning whether it's strong enough or whether it should be watered down, young people are at harm, and young people are losing their lives.\"",
      "She was speaking in support of the new Behind Our Screens campaign to encourage young people to share their experiences online.",

      "Some campaigners and opposition politicians are concerned legislation around online safety could be watered down, with the Liberal Democrats among those warning of pressure from Donald Trump to dilute regulations in exchange for improved trading terms.",
      "Asked about that prospect, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Online Safety Act was \"not negotiable, because it's the principle that if it's illegal offline, it should be illegal online\".",

      "But the true measure of these changes will be significant changes to long-standing global avenues of trade.",

      "The tariffs on Asian nations are truly remarkable. They will break the business models of thousands of companies, factories, and possibly entire nations.",
      "Some of the supply chains created by the world's biggest companies will be broken instantly. The inevitable impact will surely be to push them towards China.",
      "Is this just a grand negotiation? Well the US administration appears to be claiming the tariff revenue for planned tax cuts. The scope for quick adjustment seems limited. As one White House official said bluntly: \"This is not a negotiation, it's a national emergency\".",
      "The US's formula for the so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" basically just charges a country for having a goods trade surplus with the US, exporting more to America than it imports. Then even if there is no surplus it whacks up the charge at the universal baseline of 10%.",
      "All this reveals two things. The aim of policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero. That is a remarkable rerouting of world trade flows and explains the specific punitive focus on Asia.",

      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",
      "\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.",

    "summary": "A toxic algae bloom in southern California has sickened dozens of animals, causing them to have seizures and act erratically.",
    "story": [
      "For 20 years, Rj LaMendola found peace while paddling in the water on his surfboard.",
      "But last month off the coast of Southern California, the ocean turned hostile after a sea lion lunged at him, bit him and dragged him off his board.",
      "\"It looked possessed,\" Mr LaMendola wrote in a Facebook post, saying the animal involved in the encounter just north of Los Angeles was \"feral, almost demonic\".",
      "The surfer later learned the animal was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis- a neurological condition caused by a harmful algal bloom. It's one of dozens of sickened animals that have been spotted across California beaches recently - many suffering from symptoms like seizures or intense lethargy. The toxin often leads to death.",
      "This particular algae bloom has appeared four years in a row across California, raising concerns it might be turning into an annual event. The bloom of algae started earlier than normal this year and has spread roughly 370 miles of the iconic Southern California coastline.",
      "When Mr LaMenolda made it to shore, his wetsuit ripped open, he was bleeding and went to the hospital. \"It felt like I was being hunted,\" he said.",
      "South of where he was attacked, 15-year-old Phoebe Beltran was doing a swim test in Long Beach to become a lifeguard when a sea lion repeatedly bit her.",
      "\"I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,\" the teen told local US media.",
      "The two back-to-back attacks have garnered global headlines and caused some anxiety among those who call California and its iconic beaches home. While attacks are rare, experts say the number of animals sickened by the toxic algae bloom appears to be increasing.",
      "John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles - which is treating sea life sickened by the bloom - told the BBC these animals aren't \"naturally aggressive or actually attack people\" but the toxins impact their behaviour.",
      "\"These animals are reacting to the fact that they are sick,\" he explained. \"They're disoriented, and most likely, most of them are having seizures, and so their senses are not all fully functional as they normally would and they're acting out of fear.\"",
      "Domoic acid builds up in smaller fish like sardines and anchovies, which are eaten by marine predators such as dolphins, seals and sea lions in large quantities, causing them to get sick.",
      "Exposure to the acid causes serious neurological issues in sea lions, including seizures, disorientation and a telltale head-tilting behaviour known as \"stargazing.\"",
      "Some animals fall into a lethargic and comatose state, while others can turn aggressive.",
      "\"Their behaviour changes from what we're used to, to something more unpredictable,\" Mr Warner said. \"But in this particular bloom, we're seeing them really comatose and rather taken out by this toxin.\"",
      "The Marine Mammal Care Center is currently overwhelmed with the influx and severity of sick animals.",
      "According to Mr Warner, the nonprofit has admitted at least 195 sea lions from Feb 20 to the end of March. During the same time frame last year, the centre saw only 50 of the animals.",
      "If treated promptly, sea lions have a 50% to 65% chance of recovery, but Mr Warner says the centre is running out of space and money to treat the animals. Treatment includes anti-seizure medication and sedation, followed by twice-daily tube feeding and hydration.",
      "On top of that, the recovery pace this year has been slower, he said.",
      "While sick sea lions in 2023 typically began eating within a week, many this year are still lethargic five weeks into care.",
      "Recovery comes in stages: from a comatose state to disorientation, then aggressive reawakening\u2014when the animals are most dangerous due to lingering neurological effects.",
      "Adult sea lions can weigh hundreds of pounds, and aggressive behaviors make housing them complicated. If their behaviour doesn't normalize, it could signal permanent brain damage, and humane euthanasia becomes necessary.",
      "\"If they're still aggressive or not foraging properly, it tells us their brains aren't functioning the way they should,\" Mr Warner said.",
      "For now, beachgoers are urged to stay well away from stranded animals - at least 50 feet - and resist the temptation to intervene.",
      "\"These are still the same charismatic, really fun-to-watch expert cuddle puddlers that we see along the coast all the time,\" Mr Warner said. \"We need to remember they are wild animals. They can be unpredictable even in normal circumstances.\""

      "A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours.",
      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",
      "Rarely seen Titanic artefacts kept in secret warehouse",
      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",
      "\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.",

      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",
      "The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.",
      "Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.",
      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",
      "\"Because extinction is still forever,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?",

      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",

      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

    "summary": "More clean electricity was generated in 2024 but there was a rise in the amount of coal and gas burnt too.",
    "story": [
      "More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.",
      "But carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.",
      "That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.",
      "Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.",
      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",
      "In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.",
      "Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.",
      "But this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Solar revolution",
      "Cheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.",
      "China continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Though it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India.",
      "Wind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.",
      "Back to the 1940s",
      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",
      "In the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.",

      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",

      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",

      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",

      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",

      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",

      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",

      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",

      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",

    "story": [
      "Instagram's owner Meta and Pinterest have made significant donations to a charity set up in the name of 14-year-old Molly Russell, the BBC understands.",
      "Molly, from Harrow in northwest London, took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to a stream of suicide and self-harm content on the two platforms. A coroner concluded the negative effects of online material contributed to her death.",
      "The donations are thought to have gone to the Molly Rose Foundation, which campaigns for internet safety. Meta and Pinterest declined to comment.",
      "Molly's family said they had decided not to take legal action against the tech companies and would \"never accept compensation\" over Molly's death.",
      "In a statement via their solicitor, the family said that they would \"pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online\".",
      "Meta and other social media companies face multiple lawsuits in the US from families who claim their children were harmed by social media. The cases also involve attorneys general from more than 40 states, who claim that the design of the platforms caused harm to children.",
      "The first trial is expected to be heard in November.",

      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Molly Russell coroner urges social media changes",
      "Details of payments to the Molly Rose Foundation have not been publicly disclosed. Rose was Molly's middle name.",
      "The charity's annual report states: \"The Molly Rose Foundation has received grants from donors that wish to remain anonymous. Having considered their obligations, the Trustees have agreed to respect these wishes.\"",
      "The BBC believes that this refers to the payments to the charity from the two social media companies. These payments started in 2024 and are expected to be paid over a number of years.",
      "It's not known exactly when any agreement over donations was reached.",
      "Within the last nine months the charity has recruited a CEO, two public policy managers, a head of communications and a fundraising manager.",
      "Asked about the donations, the charity repeated in a statement that it would \"respect these wishes\" for anonymity.",
      "It is understood that no members of the Russell family have received any money from the donation.",
      "After approaching the family's solicitor, a statement was released saying: \"Following the coroner's inquest into Molly's death, we have decided that we will pursue the aims we share with Meta and Pinterest through the Molly Rose Foundation to help ensure young people have a positive experience online, instead of pursuing legal action. We, Molly's family, have always made clear that we would never accept compensation consequent upon Molly's death.\"",
      "The Molly Rose Foundation has become a leading voice in highlighting the dangers of unregulated social media and remains highly critical of Meta.",
      "It has called on the government to strengthen the existing Online Safety Act with more robust legislation.",
      "It is not calling for a children's social media ban, as planned in Australia, but is demanding that technology companies take more responsibility for the content channelled to young people through social media algorithms.",
      "In March this year, in association with publisher Pan Macmillan, the charity sent a copy of a book written by Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams to every MP in the country. In it Ms Wynn-Williams, who used to be the company's global public policy director, makes a series of critical claims about what she witnessed during her seven years at Facebook.",
      "Molly's father Ian Russell is an unpaid trustee of the foundation and remains an outspoken campaigner.",
      "In January Mr Russell wrote to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling on the government to act urgently to protect young people online. In his letter, Mr Russell said the UK was \"going backwards on online safety\".",
      "He singled out Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg for specific criticism after the company scrapped its fact-checking programme on Facebook.",
      "He said Mr Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, the owner of X, were part of a \"wholesale recalibration\" of the online world, moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\".",
      "He told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg: \"By turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money.\"",
      "Matthew Bergman, a US lawyer and founder of the Social Media Victims Law Centre, welcomed the news of the donations and paid tribute to the \"indefatigable efforts\" of Molly's father \"to hold social media companies accountable\".",
      "Meta and Pinterest were approached by BBC News, but declined to comment.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 23:51:01 GMT",
    "summary": "There's a lot of excitement about the new console - but also concern about the high price of its games.",
    "story": [
      "Nintendo has been the talk of the gaming world this week after it finally unveiled details of the much-anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, the sequel to the third-best selling console ever made.",
      "Despite excitement over its upcoming launch in June, fan conversations have been dominated by one topic - the price of its games.",
      "The console itself is priced similarly to its rivals - Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.",
      "But the games are a different story: Mario Kart World, which is being launched alongside the Switch 2, comes in at \u00a374.99.",
      "\"It makes it inaccessible, it's a lot to drop on one game,\" said Chloe Crossan, one of several gamers the BBC spoke to at a gaming store in Glasgow.",
      "I played the \u00a375 Mario Kart World on Switch 2 - was it worth it?",
      "She told the BBC she was excited about the console and its various games, but was concerned about the cost involved.",
      "\"I guess you could argue you're paying for a game that four people could play,\" she said.",
      "\"So there is that element - but it is \u00a375 for a game which is a lot.\"",
      "It's not expected that all of the Switch 2's titles will be so expensive - but charging so much for its best-known game still represents a big change in Nintendo's pricing strategy.",
      "It also risks confusing customers, as the same games can be purchased for different amounts depending on whether they are buying the physical game or the digital-only version.",
      "Experts don't think Mario Kart World will be a one off.",
      "Christopher Dring, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Game Business, said he expected to see price rises elsewhere too - particularly for the most anticipated titles, such as the latest edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.",
      "\"I think if you're going see a game that's going to be able to charge more, look out for when GTA 6 gets a release date later in the year,\" he said.",
      "He says there are lots of reasons prices might go up, part of which is that modern games are a lot of work.",
      "\"These games are taking longer to make, they require more people to make them,\" he said.",
      "But there's also the fact, he says, that video game prices have not kept up with inflation.",
      "\"I bought N64 games for \u00a350 in the turn of the century and that's \u00a380 today,\" he pointed out.",
      "For some time developers have got round that by monetising transactions in games and relying more on cheaper digital downloads.",
      "But that process, Mr Dring says, is running out of road.",
      "\"That growth has started to slow, so they're now relying on price increases.\"",
      "But it's clear those kinds of prices won't put everyone off.",
      "Another gamer the BBC spoke to, Kathryn Brown, said she and her family were excited about the Switch 2 - even if it was \"more expensive than usual\".",
      "\"If it gets good reviews, and I wait until people have bought it first, then we'll think about it,\" she said.",
      "And Lewis Tocher - who's had the original Switch since the day it launched - said he would get the console as soon as he could afford it, despite the cost of the games.",
      "But he said considering the cost of game development nowadays, he was \"surprised\" it hadn't gone up in price sooner.",
      "But what will retailers make of it?",
      "Mr Dring told the BBC this was the first time a console's physical and digital games were being priced differently.",
      "He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games.",
      "\"When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital.",
      "\"By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line.\"",
      "But of course it will be worse for the retailers who miss out on sales of the physical game.",
      "The price of failure",
      "One thing Nintendo will be hoping to avoid replicating is the disastrous launch of its handheld 3DS in 2011.",
      "It came hot off the heels of the DS, the best-selling handheld in history, with fans seemingly desperate for an upgrade.",
      "But the price tag of over \u00a3200 - more than double that of the original handheld - sparked consternation amongst fans who weren't willing to shell out so much for it.",
      "Within six months, Nintendo had slashed the price by almost half, and over time it picked up traction.",
      "It is fair to say the 3DS faced other problems such as a lacklustre list of launch games, whereas the Switch 2 is launching with the first Mario Kart game in a decade.",
      "Nonetheless Nintendo has form with price decisions backfiring.",
      "The N64 launched at \u00a3250 back in 1997, and within a year it had tumbled down to \u00a399.",
      "And in 2002 the firm cut \u00a321 off it widely-expected \u00a3150 price for the GameCube just two weeks before its launch.",
      "By bringing back the likes of Mario and Donkey Kong for the Switch 2, Nintendo has consciously looked to the past with its new console.",
      "It will be hoping it won't be forced to do the same with its decisions around prices.",

      "After months of speculation, Nintendo has confirmed the successor to its wildly popular Switch console will be released on 5 June, when it will cost \u00a3395.99 to buy in the UK.",
      "But it's not so much the price of the Switch 2 but its games that have been raising eyebrows, with the new Mario Kart World that is being released alongside it coming in at a whopping \u00a374.99 for a physical copy.",
      "Fans will have to wait weeks before seeing what the new console and game are like - and whether they are worth that sort of money - but here's what I found when Nintendo gave me a chance to try them both out.",
      "When I first got my hands on the Switch 2, one thing became very clear to me - like the name suggests, Nintendo wants you to know this is a direct sequel to the Switch.",
      "This isn't like the jump from the Wii to the confusingly named Wii U, swapping motion controllers for a tablet that looked dated even back when the console released.",
      "Instead, the Switch 2 looks and feels just like its predecessor, with buttons in the places you'd expect - and a much larger (and nicer) screen.",
      "What's it like to play?",
      "It's fair to say Mario Kart World makes a fantastic first impression, thanks to the console having more power under the hood.",
      "It looks spectacular compared to previous Switch titles, though we're still talking about cartoony graphics - make no mistake, the console is more powerful but it's no match for the higher spec PlayStation 5, let alone PS5 Pro.",
      "And in my three races the standout feature wasn't the swishy new graphics or the controller, it was a trick that is becoming Nintendo's hallmark: making the new feel familiar.",
      "Despite having never picked up a Switch 2, I stormed my way to consecutive first place finishes, much to the chagrin of those around me.",
      "But it doesn't come cheap.",
      "The digital version of the game costs \u00a366.99, it's another \u00a38 on top of that for a physical copy - or pay an an extra \u00a335 for a version of the Switch 2 with it built-in, something which pushes the console price to \u00a3429.99.",
      "According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz.",
      "\u201cThese cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,\u201d he said.",
      "In the US, Mario Kart World will be priced at $79.99, with the console selling for $449.99 (or $499.99 with Mario Kart bundled in).",
      "Mouse control and Donkey Kong destruction",
      "But there\u2019s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart.",
      "Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4,  the first game in the series in 18 years.",
      "But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the \"A\" button - there\u2019s a significant new feature too.",
      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",
      "It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.",
      "Rivals and originals",
      "Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch.",
      "Like the other Switch 2 games, they looked good - and of course they will benefit as the new console, like the original, can play games on the go.",
      "The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system.",
      "But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit.",
      "Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games.",
      "Nintendo would say something its rivals don\u2019t have is that long list of exclusive titles.",
      "But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity.",
      "The console is the Switch 2, rather than having a completely new name. Many of those exclusives Nintendo is so proud of are new games in established series, while others are remasters of modern classics.",
      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",
      "Will the Switch 2's slick nostalgia hit provide that? We'll start to find out in June."

    "summary": "India wants to boost the domestic trainer industry but will small domestic makers suffer?",
    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",
      "\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

      "The US does not normally see high interest rates on its debt as its bonds are viewed as a safe investment, but on Wednesday rates spiked sharply to touch 4.5%.",
      "The rise came after Trump pressed ahead with sweeping tariffs on goods being imported into the US, while Washington's trade war with China escalated further - although Trump on Wednesday did put a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for some countries.",
      "After the US implemented a 104% tariff on products from China at midnight on Wednesday, Beijing hit back with 84% levy on American products. Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.",
      "Stock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.",
      "However, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.",

      "\"Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,\" he added.",

      "Mohammed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former boss of the biggest bond manager Pimco, said one reason US borrowing costs had shot up was because there had been an \"erosion\" of bonds being seen as a safe haven.",
      "He added concerns over the impact of tariffs on inflation and US government budgets were also reasons.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve step in?",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank - the US Federal Reserve -  might be forced to step in if turbulence continues, in a move reminiscent of the Bank of England's emergency action in 2022 following Liz Truss's mini-Budget.",
      "\"We see no other option for the Fed but to step in with emergency purchases of US Treasuries to stabilise the bond market,\" said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank.",

      "Economists have predicted US tariffs, which will be paid for by American companies importing goods from abroad, will raise consumer prices domestically.",
      "Trump's plan is aimed at protecting American businesses from foreign competition and also to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "However, tumbling stock markets resulting from fears extra taxes will hit the profits of companies, could lead ultimately to firms cutting jobs and an economic downturn.",
      "'US recession a coin toss'",
      "JP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.",
      "He said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.",
      "This is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",

      "Four people died - including two British tourists - and several more were seriously injured when the two aircraft hit each other in January 2023, near Sea World on the Gold Coast.",
      "An investigation by Australia's Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) found one of the pilots did not hear a vital radio call shortly before the accident, and that a series of changes by Sea World meant risk controls were over time eroded.",
      "The accident rocked the Gold Coast, one of the nation's biggest tourist hotspots.",
      "The two helicopters collided around 20 seconds after one had taken off and as the other was landing.",
      "Those who died were all travelling in the helicopter which was taking off. The other aircraft managed to make an emergency landing, with passengers suffering a range of injuries.",
      "The ATSB report found that in the months leading up to the accident, Sea World had tried to improve its offering of leisure flights by adding a second helipad location and introducing larger Eurocopter EC140 B4 helicopters.",
      "\"Over time, these changes undermined risk controls used to manage traffic separation and created a conflict point between... helicopters,\" it said.",
      "The aircraft preparing to take off also had a faulty antenna.",
      "In the run-up to the collision, a call from the arriving helicopter was either not received or not heard by the pilot on the ground, who was loading passengers at the time.",
      "However, once the passengers were on board, a ground crew member advised the departing helicopter pilot that the airspace was clear. By the time the chopper took off, though, that information was no longer correct.",
      "Meanwhile the pilot who was wanting to land after a five-minute scenic flight had seen the other helicopter on the ground but didn't deem it a threat, the report said.",
      "He would have expected to have been alerted by a \"taxiing\" radio call if that situation changed. However the faulty antenna likely prevented the broadcast of the taxiing call, the report said.",
      "\"Without the taxiing call being received, the pilot of the inbound helicopter, who was likely focusing on their landing site, had no trigger to reassess the status of the departing helicopter as a collision risk.\"",
      "Among those who died were Diane Hughes, 57, and her 65-year-old husband Ron who were from Neston, Cheshire. They had married in 2022 and were on holiday visiting relatives after being separated by COVID.",

      "Shortly after the accident, the passengers on the flight that was returning hailed the pilot as a \"hero\" for landing the helicopter safely.",
      "In all, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau made 28 findings that underline \"key lessons\" for operators and pilots.",
      "\"The most fundamental lesson from this investigation is that making changes to aviation operations, even those that appear to increase safety, can have unintended consequences,\" ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said.",
      "\"It is therefore critical that changes to aviation operations are managed through the implementation of a defined process to ensure overall safety is not adversely affected.\""

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has called President Donald Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, a \"moron\" over comments he made about his electric vehicle firm, Tesla.",
      "Musk - who is also a member of the Trump administration - said Navarro was \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" in posts on his social media platform X.",
      "It was in response to an interview Navarro gave in which he criticised Musk. \"[He's] not a car manufacturer. He's a car assembler, in many cases,\" Navarro said.",
      "Navarro was being interviewed about Trump's sweeping tariff policy and said he wanted to see parts made in the US in the future instead.",
      "Musk, who has hinted at his opposition to White House trade policy, said Navarro's claims about Tesla were \"demonstrably false\".",
      "The spat was the most public sign of disagreement yet between Trump's trade team and Musk,  the world's richest man who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) which is tasked with slashing the size and spending of the federal government.",
      "Later on Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt was asked about the row between Musk and Navarro. \"These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs,\" she told reporters.",
      "\"Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Trump has in part justified his global wave of tariffs by saying he wants to revive manufacturing in the US. This is an argument Navarro made during an appearance on CNBC on Monday.",
      "\"If you look at our auto industry, right, we're an assembly line for German engines and transmissions right now,\" he said.",
      "\"We're going to get to a place where America makes stuff again, real wages are going to be up, profits are going to be up,\" Navarro added.",
      "Responding to the comments on Tuesday, Musk posted a link to a 2023 article by car valuation firm Kelley Blue Book, which cited Cars.com findings that Tesla vehicles had the most parts produced in the US.",
      "\"By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content,\" Musk wrote in a follow-up post.",
      "Technology industry analyst Dan Ives said the company was less exposed to tariffs than other US car makers such as GM, Ford, and Stellantis.",
      "But he too claimed the company sourced the majority of its parts from outside the US, particularly China.",
      "\"The tariffs in their current form will disrupt Tesla, the overall supply chain, and its global footprint which has been a clear advantage over the years vs. rising competitors like BYD,\" he said.",

      "\"Seventy-nine percent of them said they're embarrassed in front of international partners, and 89 percent said this is needlessly taking us into a recession and a misguided economic policy,\" Mr Sonnenfeld told the BBC, referring to a survey taken at the event he hosted.",

      "A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House blocked the news agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\".",
      "District Judge Trevor McFadden on Tuesday said the administration's restriction on AP journalists was \"contrary to the First Amendment\", which guarantees freedom of speech.",
      "The dispute arose when the AP refused to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" in its coverage, following an executive order by President Donald Trump.",
      "The ban has meant that the AP has been unable to access press events at the White House as well as Air Force One.",
      "Judge McFadden, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, also paused the ruling's implementation until Sunday to allow administration's lawyers time to appeal.",
      "\"The Court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,\" he wrote in his ruling. \"The Constitution requires no less.\"",
      "The AP had argued that the administration violated the news agency's  constitutional right to free speech by restricting access due to disagreements over  language.",
      "In February, Judge McFadden had declined to immediately restore its access to presidential events.",
      "After Tuesday's ruling, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said the agency was \"gratified by the court's decision\".",
      "\"Today's ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the US Constitution,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Shortly after the judge's ruling, though, two AP journalists were turned away from covering an event that Trump attended on Tuesday night, the agency reported in an update on Wednesday.",
      "A photographer and reporter were blocked from blocked from joining Trump's motorcade that was traveling to a dinner held by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the agency reported.",
      "The ruling was also welcomed by other organisations who had criticised the  initial restrictions on the AP.",
      "\"This is a careful, well-reasoned opinion that properly describes the exclusion of the Associated Press from the press pool as retaliatory, viewpoint-based, and unconstitutional,\" said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.",
      "The AP sued three senior Trump administration officials \u2014 Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich \u2014 claiming the restrictions were unlawful and infringed on press freedom.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the Associated Press was not entitled to \"special access\" to the president.",
      "Soon after taking office in January, the Trump administration issued an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", a move the White House said reflects the gulf's status as \"an indelible part of America\".",
      "The AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to rename it.",
      "In response, the White House restricted the AP's access to events covered by the \"pool\" of journalists who report back to other media outlets.",
      "Trump has targeted several US media outlets since his return to office, including shuttering the government-funded Voice of America network, which was set up during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda, and Radio Free Asia, a move that was welcomed by the Chinese government.",
      "He has also threatened funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS, saying the radio and tv outlets, which only receive a portion of their budget from the federal government, are biased against conservatives. Under his watch, the Federal Communications Commission has also opened lawsuits against the major networks ABC, CBS and NBC.",
      "At the same time, his administration has opened up access to the White House for up-and-coming media, including newer networks that skew more conservative, as well as podcasters and social media influencers.",

    "summary": "The BBC's James Landale looks at how Iran might respond to Trump's threat to agree to a deal or face military action",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is a man in a hurry.",
      "In the few short months he has been in office, the US president has sought and failed to bring peace to Gaza and Ukraine. He has bombed Yemen. He has launched a global trade war. Now he is turning his attention to Iran.",
      "This has always been on the president's jobs list. For Trump, Iran is unfinished business from his first term.",
      "The issue remains the same as it was then: what can stop Iran seeking a nuclear weapon?",
      "Iran denies it has any such ambition. But other countries believe the Islamic republic wants at the very least the capacity to build a nuclear warhead, a desire that some fear could spark an arms race or even all-out war in the Middle East.",
      "In 2015, Iran agreed a deal with the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. It was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).",
      "Under its provisions, Iran would limit its nuclear ambitions - and allow in international inspectors - in return for getting economic sanctions lifted.",
      "But Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, claiming it rewarded terrorism by funding Iran's proxy militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The US reimposed sanctions.",
      "Iran subsequently ignored some of the deal's restrictions and enriched more and more uranium nuclear fuel.",
      "Analysts fear Iran could soon have enough weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear warhead.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) watchdog estimates Iran's stockpile of 60% enriched uranium could make about six bombs if it was enriched to the next and final level.",
      "Within days of his inauguration, Trump restored his former policy of so-called \"maximum pressure\" on Iran.",
      "On 4 February, with his trademark fat felt-tip pen, he signed a memorandum ordering the US Treasury to impose further sanctions on Iran and punish countries violating existing sanctions, especially those buying Iranian oil.",
      "Now the White House is hoping to match that economic pressure with diplomacy.",
      "Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.",
      "The president offered to begin negotiations and sought a deal within a couple of months.",
      "Now he has agreed to direct discussions between US and Iranian officials in Oman at the weekend.",
      "The US threat to Iran is explicit: agree a deal or face military action.",
      "\"If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,\" Trump said on Monday.",
      "So how might Iran respond?",
      "Some policymakers in Tehran appear keen to agree a deal that could get sanctions lifted.",
      "Iran's economy is in dire straits, with soaring inflation and a plunging currency.",
      "But any such deal might involve compromises some hardliners could find hard to stomach.",
      "Iran has suffered huge reverses in recent months, seeing its proxy militias severely weakened by war with Israel and its regional ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, ousted. Some in Tehran argue now may be exactly the time to build a nuclear deterrent.",
      "Both the US and Iran seem far apart. Their negotiating positions are not explicit.",
      "But the US has made clear it wants the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear programme, including a complete end to any further uranium enrichment, plus no further support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.",
      "That might prove too much for Iran to accept.",
      "A complete ban on any nuclear enrichment - even for civilian purposes - has long been seen as an absolute red line for Tehran.",
      "There is also the problem of Iranian technological expertise: its scientists simply know more now about how to make a nuclear weapon than they did 10 years ago.",
      "As for Israel, it has made clear it would accept only the complete end to any Iranian nuclear capability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would agree to \"the way it was done in Libya\".",
      "This is a reference to the decision by late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to dismantle his entire nuclear programme in 2003 in return for getting sanctions lifted.",
      "But Iran is unlikely to follow this precedent.",
      "What if talks fail?",
      "Israel has long considered military options to try to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. But many are buried deep in underground bunkers.",
      "Military analysts say Israel would need not just US help to bomb Iran, it might also need special forces on the ground to guarantee the destruction of its nuclear facilities.",
      "This means military action would be risky and its success by no means guaranteed.",
      "Trump also came to office promising not to start any more so-called \"forever wars\", and an all-out regional conflict involving Iran could become one of those.",
      "That has not stopped the US president from reportedly giving Israel more air defences and deploying more long-range B2 bombers to the region.",
      "So, for now, Trump seems to be looking for a diplomatic solution - one Israel might have to accept as a fait accompli, regardless of its provisions.",
      "But if there is no agreement, he is reserving the right to use force, the consequences of which could be devastating.",
      "In the meantime, the president is allowing two months for both sides to agree a deal.",
      "He may have forgotten it took negotiators two years to agree the JCPOA. Rushed diplomacy is not always successful diplomacy.",

      "C\u00e9sar (not his real name) is a member of the Latin Kings, a criminal drug gang in Ecuador. He was recruited by a corrupt counternarcotics police officer to work for the Albanian mafia, one of Europe's most prolific cocaine trafficking networks.",
      "The Albanian mafia has expanded its presence in Ecuador in recent years, drawn by key trafficking routes through the country, and it now controls much of the cocaine flow from South America to Europe.",
      "Despite Ecuador not producing the drug, 70% of the world's cocaine now flows through its ports, Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa says.",
      "It is smuggled into the country from neighbouring Colombia and Peru \u2013 the world's two largest producers of cocaine.",
      "Police say they seized a record amount of illicit drugs last year, the majority of it cocaine, and that this indicates total exports are on the rise.",
      "The consequences are deadly: January 2025 saw 781 murders, making it the deadliest month in recent years. Many of them were related to the illegal drug trade.",
      "We spoke to people in the supply chain to understand why this crisis is worsening \u2013 and how rising European cocaine consumption is fuelling it.",
      "C\u00e9sar, 36, first started working with cartels when he was 14 years old, citing poor job opportunities as one factor.",
      "\"The Albanians needed someone to solve problems,\" he explains. \"I knew the port guards, the transport drivers, the CCTV camera supervisors.\"",
      "He bribes them to help smuggle drugs into Ecuador's ports or to turn a blind eye \u2013 and the occasional camera.",
      "After cocaine arrives in Ecuador from Colombia or Peru it is stashed in warehouses until his Albanian employers become aware of a shipping container that will be leaving one of the ports for Europe.",
      "Gangs use three main methods to smuggle cocaine into shipments: hiding drugs in cargo before it reaches the port, breaking into containers at the port, or attaching drugs to ships at sea.",
      "Sometimes C\u00e9sar has made up to $3,000 (\u00a32,235) for one job, but the incentive is not just money: \"If you don't do a job the Albanians ask for, they'll kill you.\"",
      "C\u00e9sar says he feels some regret over his role in the drugs trade, particularly what he calls the \"collateral victims\".",
      "But he believes that the fault lies with the consumer countries. \"If consumption keeps growing, so will trafficking. It will be unstoppable,\" he says, adding: \"If they fight it there, it will end here.\"",
      "Ordinary workers, not just gang members, get caught in this supply chain.",
      "Juan, not his real name, is a truck driver. One day he picked up a tuna shipment to take to the port. He says that something seemed off.",
      "\"The first alarm bell was when we went to the warehouse and it only had the cargo, nothing else. It was a rented warehouse, no company name,\" he recalls.",
      "\"Two months later, I saw on the news that the containers had been seized in Amsterdam, full of drugs. We never knew.\"",
      "Some drivers unknowingly transport drugs; others are coerced \u2013 if they refuse, they are killed.",
      "European gangs are drawn to Ecuador for its location but also its legal exports, which provide a convenient way to hide illicit cargo.",
      "\"Banana exports make up 66% of containers that leave Ecuador, 29.81% go to the European Union, where drug consumption is growing,\" explains banana industry representative Jos\u00e9 Antonio Hidalgo.",
      "Some gangs have even set up fake fruit import or export companies in Europe and Ecuador as a front for illicit activities.",
      "\"These European traffickers pose as businessmen,\" says \"Jos\u00e9\" (not his real name), a prosecutor who targets organised crime groups and who spoke anonymously due to threats he has received.",
      "One notorious example is Dritan Gjika, accused of being one of the most powerful Albanian mafia leaders in Ecuador.",
      "Prosecutors say he had stakes in fruit export companies in Ecuador, and import companies in Europe, which he used to traffic cocaine. He remains on the run, but many of his accomplices faced convictions after a multinational police operation.",
      "Lawyer Monica Luz\u00e1rraga defended one of his associates and now speaks candidly about her knowledge of how these networks operate.",
      "\"In those years, banana exports to Albania boomed,\" she says.",
      "She appears frustrated that authorities did not put two and two together sooner that criminal groups were using this as a front: \"The entire economy here is stagnant. Yet one item that has increased in exports is bananas. So, two plus two equals four.\"",
      "Why exports are rising",
      "At Ecuador's ports, the police and armed forces try to control the situation.",
      "Boats patrol the waters, police scan banana boxes for bricks of cocaine \u2013 even police scuba divers search for drugs hidden beneath ships.",
      "Everyone is heavily armed, even those simply guarding banana boxes before they are loaded into shipping containers. This is because if drugs are found during a search, a corrupt port worker would likely be involved, and it could trigger a violent incident.",
      "Despite these efforts, police say the amount of cocaine being successfully smuggled out of Ecuador has reached a record high. Rising demand and economic factors are blamed.",
      "Nearly 300 tonnes of drugs were seized last year \u2013 a new annual record, according to Ecuador's interior ministry.",
      "Major Christian Cozar Cueva of the National Police says that \"there has been about a 30% increase in seizures headed for Europe in recent years\".",
      "This increase in cocaine shipments has made it more dangerous for those caught up in the supply chain.",
      "Truck driver \"Juan\" says the rise of \"container contamination\" makes him more vulnerable.",
      "He says officials seized a container the day before with two tonnes of drugs: \"It used to be kilos, now we talk about tonnes.\"",
      "\"If you don't contaminate the containers, you have two options: leave the job or end up dead.\"",
      "An economy battered by the Covid pandemic left more Ecuadoreans vulnerable to gang recruitment.",
      "A state that was financially stretched post-pandemic, a security force which had less experience dealing with organised crime, and previously lax visa rules facilitated European gangs' presence there post-2020.",
      "Monica Luz\u00e1rraga says 2021 was the year when the \"Albanian mafia infiltration took off\".",
      "She says this period coincided with an \"influx\" of Albanian citizens and a spike in banana exports, including to Albania.",
      "\"This is a lucrative business that harms Ecuador and benefits criminal organisations. How can we accept an economy built on suffering?\"",
      "A message to Europe",
      "This ire toward foreign cartels is unsurprising, given their contribution to rising violence.",
      "But one thing some traffickers and those fighting them agree on: the trade is fuelled by consumers, particularly in Europe, the US and Australia.",
      "UN data shows global cocaine consumption has hit record levels. Its surveys suggest the UK has the world's second highest rate of cocaine use.",
      "The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates the UK consumes about 117 tonnes of cocaine annually and has the biggest market in Europe.",
      "Evidence suggests consumption in the UK is rising.",
      "The UK Home Office's analysis of wastewater suggests cocaine consumption increased by 7% from 2023 to 2024. NCA operations seized about 232 tonnes of cocaine in 2024, compared with 194 tonnes in 2023.",

      "\"In Europe there are citizens willing to pay large amounts of money to have the drugs they consume. The drugs that are ultimately costing the lives of Ecuadorean citizens.\"",

      "At the second edition of Startup Mahakumbh, a government-led start-up conclave last week, Goyal seemed to take a hard look at India's consumer start-ups as he urged entrepreneurs to explore more innovations in technology in order to help the country progress.",
      "Poking fun at the rise of food delivery apps, artisanal brands and online betting apps in the country, he compared them with the innovations being made by the \"other side\", which many took to mean China.",
      "He said that while \"they\" were making leaps in machine learning, robotics and building \"next-gen factories that can compete with the rest of the world\", India's start-ups were still largely focussed on lifestyle products like gluten-free ice creams.",
      "His comments sparked a flurry of reactions from India's top innovators, with some arguing that he was only encouraging creators to be more ambitious and others calling it an unfair criticism of the start-up ecosystem, a major contributor to the country's economy.",
      "To be sure, Goyal also praised the pace at which new businesses were popping up in the country, hailing India as the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world. He also urged Indian investors to do more to support Indian creators.",
      "But he seemed to want to see more happen, and faster.",
      "\"We have to be willing to evolve and learn. [If] we want to be bigger and better, then we have to be bolder and we should not fight shy of the competition,\" the minister said.",
      "At one point, he asked the audience - brimming with entrepreneurs and investors - \"Do we want to make ice creams or [semiconductor] chips?\"",
      "Aadit Palicha, co-founder of the quick-commerce app Zepto, was quick to call out the minister.",
      "In a post on X, he argued that it was consumer internet companies like his that have led innovation in the technology space, in India and globally.",
      "Can tech stop India wasting so much of its harvest?The private firms helping India aim high in space",
      "Can tech stop India wasting so much of its harvest?",
      "The private firms helping India aim high in space",
      "He pointed out that Amazon - originally a consumer internet company - had scaled cloud computing while the big players in AI today, like Facebook and Google, were once consumer internet companies too.",
      "He urged Indian investors to support consumer internet companies so that they can grow and use their profits for making more ambitious innovations.",
      "Mohandas Pai, a prominent angel investor, told news channel Economic Times Now that there was a dearth of capital investment in deep-tech start-ups from the government and private players.",
      "He explained that investors made a beeline for lifestyle-focused start-ups because they gave quick returns.",
      "Deep-tech innovations take a long time to develop and require expensive infrastructure. \"People are not willing to take long-term risks. We need long-term 'patient' money [for deep tech start-ups to thrive],\" he said.",
      "He also said that regulatory curbs on foreign investments in Indian start-ups were hurting innovation.",
      "\"Deep tech start-ups also struggle to find a market,\" he added, citing the example of an Indian firm that recently pioneered a quick-charging battery for buses but found no takers for its product.",
      "Many social media users also spoke about the challenges they faced when they tried to start their own tech businesses.",
      "Some said they struggled to get loans, others highlighted high import taxes on certain foreign raw materials and equipment, while some others spoke about unnecessary red tape that made getting documents and approvals a nightmare.",
      "But some entrepreneurs also defended the minister, saying that his comments were well-intentioned and a much-needed reality-check for the start-up ecosystem.",
      "Vironika S, founder of edtech app Proxy Gyan, agreed that India's future leadership of the global economy depended on breakthroughs in AI and semiconductors but added that there were realistic barriers to doing so and that the government could help by easing them.",
      "Indian investor Kushal Bhagia said in a post on X that Goyal was right about ambition and a lack of deep tech start-ups in India. \"We just don't meet enough founders who are doing something truly deep tech or going after big ambitious problem statements,\" he said.",
      "He attributed this to India's tech talent leaving the country to work in US firms and to a dearth of deep-tech founders for people to learn from and be inspired by.",
      "The minister's comments also got the media analysing different journeys of Indian and Chinese start-ups.",
      "Journalist Abhijeet Kumar wrote in the Business Standard newspaper that in 2023, just 5% of Indian start-up funding went into deep-tech sectors, compared to 35% in China. He also pointed out how Beijing actively promoted high-tech innovation - in 2024, it had slashed $361bn in taxes and fees for high-tech firms, including $80.7bn in research and development deductions.",
      "In an editorial published on Monday, the newspaper also noted that India's start-ups are more consumption-driven, focused on using technology to solve local problems at scale rather than global ones by creating path-breaking foundational models.",
      "It pointed out that India currently had 4,000 deep-tech start-ups and that this number was expected to jump to 10,000 by 2030 and quoted a Nasscom report which said that India's deep tech-start-ups attracted $1.6bn in funding in 2024, marking a 78% year-on-year increase.",
      "But there's still a long way to go.",
      "\"As the deep-tech race intensifies globally, it is clear that India will have to do a lot to catch up with these countries,\" the editorial said, adding that Goyal's comments should \"serve as a call to action\" for start-ups and investors and also for the government.",
      "\"This can include setting up deep-tech innovation funds, building strong academia-start-up bridges and offering incentives for faster developments in hardware, AI, biotech and clean energy,\" it said.",

    "story": [
      "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "Agents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas.",
      "According to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members.",
      "The government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".",
      "But despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case.",
      "A Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.",
      "On Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.",
      "Immigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.",
      "\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.",
      "\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"",
      "The Trump administration pushes back",
      "US District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.",
      "She ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".",
      "Yet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.",
      "\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.",

      "US judge scolds Trump officials for failing to return man deported in error",
      "US Supreme Court pauses order requiring return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia",
      "Nicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.",
      "She also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.",
      "Prof Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.",
      "The US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.",
      "\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.",
      "Mr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.",
      "The Department of Justice, however, has resisted calls to take such action.",
      "US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that \"it was an administrative error as to why he was deported,\" but maintained the allegation that Mr Garcia belonged to a gang.",
      "\"We believe he should stay where he is,\" she said.",
      "Mr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.",
      "Mr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.",
      "He was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.",
      "Such orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.",
      "\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.",
      "A judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.",
      "Department of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".",
      "The Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.",
      "Supreme Court showdown looms",
      "The Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.",
      "President Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"",
      "Immigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.",
      "\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

      "\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.",
      "\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.",

      "The case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.",
      "Their first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.",
      "But prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "Over the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.",

      "We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held under Israel's Unlawful Combatants Law, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group.",
      "The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks - a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal.",
      "Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees.

      "It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be \"examined by the relevant authorities\". It added that others \"were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine\".",

In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.\"",

      "The five Palestinians interviewed in depth were returned earlier this year under the ceasefire deal with Hamas - the group that led the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.",
      "They were among about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees exchanged for 33 Israeli hostages, eight dead and 25 living, some of whom have described being abused, starved and threatened by their Hamas captors.",

      "They said they had been abused at every stage of the process.",
      "More than a dozen other released detainees, whom the BBC spoke to more briefly as they arrived home in Gaza, also gave accounts of beatings, hunger and disease.",
      "These, in turn, align with testimony given by others to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem and the United Nations, which in July detailed reports from returning detainees that they had been stripped naked, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burned with cigarettes, and had dogs set on them.",
      "A further report by UN experts last month documented cases of rape and sexual assault, and said using this as a threat was \"standard operating procedure\" for the IDF. Israel responded to say it \"categorically rejects the unfounded allegations\".",

      "Warning: Graphic image below",
      "Soldiers mixed chemicals used for cleaning into a pot, he told us, and dunked his head in them. The interrogators then punched him, he said, and he fell to the rubble-strewn floor, injuring his eye. He said they then covered his eye with a cloth, which he said \"worsened his injury\".",
      "They also set him alight, he told us.",
      "\"They used an air freshener with a lighter to set my back on fire. I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out. It spread from my neck down to my legs. Then, they repeatedly hit me with the bottoms of their rifles, and had sticks with them, which they used to hit and poke me on my sides,\" he said.",
      "They then \"continued pouring acid on me. I spent around a day and a half being washed with [it],\" he told us.",
      "\"They poured it on my head, and it dripped down my body while I was sitting on the chair.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, soldiers poured water on his body, and drove him into Israel where he received medical treatment in hospital, including skin grafts.",
      "Most of his treatment, he said, took place at a field hospital at Sde Teiman barracks, an IDF base near Beersheba in southern Israel. He said he was cuffed naked to a bed and given a nappy instead of access to a toilet. Israeli doctors at this hospital have previously told the BBC shackling patients and forcing them to wear nappies is routine.",
      "When the BBC interviewed Mr Abu Tawileh shortly after his release, his back was covered in red welts. The residual pain from his burns still woke him up, he said, and his vision had been affected.",
      "The BBC was not able to speak to anyone who witnessed an attack on Mr Abu Tawileh, but a specialist eye doctor who treated him on his return to Gaza confirmed that he had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it. He also said Mr Abu Tawileh's vision was weakening, due to either the chemicals or other trauma.",
      "We showed images of his injuries and gave details of his testimony to several UK doctors, who said they appeared consistent with his account, though they noted there were limitations to what they could assess by looking at photos.",
      "The BBC gave extensive details of this account to the IDF, giving it five days to investigate. It did not respond directly to Mr Abu Tawileh's allegations but said it took any actions \"which contradict its values very seriously\".",
      "It said it would \"examine\" some of the cases, but did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this included Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Others we interviewed also described abuse at the point of arrest.",
      "\"They cuffed us and hit us. No-one would give me a drop of water,\" said Abdul Karim Mushtaha, a 33-year-old poultry slaughterhouse worker, who told us he was arrested in November 2023 at an Israeli checkpoint while following evacuation orders with his family. A report filed by a lawyer who later visited Mr Mushtaha noted he had been \"subjected to severe beatings, humiliation, degradation and stripping during his arrest until he was transferred to prison\".",
      "Two said they had then been left outside in the cold for hours, and two said Israeli soldiers stole their belongings and money.",
      "The BBC gave details of the allegations of theft to the IDF, which described it as \"contrary to the law and IDF values\". It said it would \"thoroughly\" examine the cases if more details were provided.",
      "All our interviewees, including Mr Mushtaha, said they were transferred to the Israeli barracks of Sde Teiman, where Mr Abu Tawileh also said he received treatment in its field hospital.",
      "One interviewee told us he was mistreated on the way there. He asked for his name not to be published for fear of reprisals, so we are calling him \"Omar\".",
      "He said Israeli soldiers stood and spat on him, and others with him, calling them \"sons of pigs\" and \"sons of Sinwar\" - referring to the Hamas leader and architect of the 7 October attacks, killed by Israel five months ago.",
      "\"They made us listen to a voice recording that said: 'What you did to our children, we will do to your children',\" said the 33-year-old, who worked for an electrical cable company.",
      "Sde Teiman has been the focus of previous serious complaints in the wake of the October 2023 attacks. Several soldiers stationed there were charged in February after they were filmed assaulting a detainee, resulting in his hospitalisation for a torn rectum and a punctured lung. In a separate case, a soldier at the base was sentenced after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza.",
      "Three of the men we spoke to alleged that dogs were used to intimidate detainees at Sde Teiman and other facilities.",
      "\"We would get beaten up when they took us from the barracks to the medical clinic or the interrogation room - they'd set [muzzled] dogs on us, tighten our cuffs,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh who was held in general detention in the barracks, as well as being treated there.",
      "The BBC asked the IDF to respond to allegations it frequently used dogs to intimidate and attack detainees. It said: \"The use of dogs to harm detainees is prohibited.\"",
      "It also said there were \"experienced terrorists considered to be very dangerous among the detainees held in IDF detention facilities\" and that \"in exceptional cases there is extended shackling during their detention\".",
      "Several detainees said they had been forced to assume stress positions, including having their arms lifted above their heads for hours.",
      "\"We would be sitting on our knees from 5am until 10pm, when it was time to sleep,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Hamad al-Dahdouh, another interviewee, said beatings at the barracks \"targeted our heads and sensitive areas like the eyes [and] ears\".",
      "The 44-year-old, who worked as a farmer before the war, said he had suffered temporary back and ear damage as a result, and his rib cage had been fractured.",
      "The IDF did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Mr Dahdouh and some of the other released detainees said electric shocks were also used during interrogations or as punishment.",

      "During these interrogations they had been accused of links with Hamas, the men added.",
      "\"Anyone who was imprisoned\u2026 they said: 'You are a terrorist',\" said Mr Mushtaha. \"They always tried to tell us that we had taken part in 7 October. They all had a grudge.",

      "He said interrogations would go through the night.",
      "\"For three nights, I couldn't sleep because they were torturing me. Our hands were tied and put above our heads for hours, and we weren't wearing anything. Any time you would say 'I'm cold'\u2026 they would fill a bucket with cold water, pour it on you and switch on the fan.\"",
      "Mr Dahdouh said their interrogators told them that whoever is from Gaza \"is affiliated with terrorist groups\", and when detainees asked if they could challenge this in court they were told there was no time for that.",
      "He said he was not given access to a lawyer. The IDF told the BBC: \"Israeli law grants the right to judicial review in a civil district court, legal representation by an attorney, and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.\"",
      "\"Omar\" said he was taken for three days of interrogation when he first arrived at Sde Teiman.",
      "He said the detainees were dressed in thin overalls and held in a freezing room, with loud speakers playing Israeli music.",
      "When the questioning was over, the men said they were led back to the barracks blindfolded.",
      "\"We didn't know if night had come or morning had come. You don't see the sun. You don't see anything,\" said Omar.",
      "The IDF said it had \"oversight mechanisms\", including closed-circuit cameras, \"to ensure that detention facilities are managed in accordance with IDF orders and the law\".",
      "Omar and Mr Mushtaha said they were then transferred to Ketziot prison, where they described a \"welcoming ceremony\" of beatings and other abuse.",
      "Omar said he witnessed sexual assault at Ketziot.",
      "\"They took the clothes off some of the guys and would do shameful acts\u2026 They forced guys to perform sex acts on each other. I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't penetrative sex. He would tell one guy to suck another guy. It was obligatory.\"",
      "The BBC did not receive any other reports of this nature, but the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which tracks conditions of Palestinians in Israeli jails, described sexual abuse of detainees held in Ketziot as a \"common occurrence\". This ranged from rape and sexual harassment to the beatings of genitals, it said.",
      "The group said that while it had not received testimony of forced sexual acts between detainees, it had been told some had been made to look at each other naked and had been thrown on top of each other naked.",
      "A report by B'Tselem has also gathered allegations of sexual violence, including from one prisoner who said guards attempted to rape him with a carrot.",
      "The BBC put the allegation that prisoners were forced to perform sexual acts on each other to the Israel Prison Service (IPS). It replied that it was \"not aware\" of the sexual abuse claim or any of the other claims made about treatment and conditions at Ketziot and other prisons that the BBC had gathered.",
      "It said: \"IPS is a law enforcement organisation that operates according to the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the state comptroller and many other official critiques.",
      "\"All prisoners are detained according to the law. All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. We are not aware of the claims you described and, as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.",
      "\"Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\"",
      "Omar said they were also hit with batons at Ketziot prison.",
      "\"After we got tortured, I was in pain all night - from my back to my legs. The guys would carry me from my mattress to the toilet. My body, my back, my legs - my whole body was blue from beatings. For nearly two months I couldn't move.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha described having his head slammed into a door, and his genitals hit.",
      "\"They would strip us naked. They would Taser us. They would hit us in a sensitive place. They would tell us 'We will castrate you',\" he said.",
      "He said beatings were \"meant to break your bones\", and that detainees would sometimes be grouped together and have hot water poured over them.",
      "\"The amount of torture was enormous,\" he added.",
      "Both he and Omar also described incidents of what they said amounted to medical negligence.",
      "\"My hands were all blisters and swollen,\" said Mr Mushtaha.",
      "\"If people could have seen my legs they would have said they needed to be amputated from the inflammation\u2026 [Guards] would just tell me to wash my hands and legs with water and soap.",
      "\"But how was I meant to do this, when there was only water for one hour a day [between us], and as for soap, every week they would bring [only] a spoon of shampoo,\" he added.",
      "Mr Mushtaha said he was told by guards that: \"As long as you have a pulse you are in good shape. As long as you are standing, you're in good shape. When your pulse is gone, we will come to treat you.\"",
      "A report by a lawyer who visited both Mr Mushtaha and Omar in Ketziot last September said of Mr Mushtaha: \"The prisoner, like the rest of the prisoners, suffers from pain due to boils on his hands, feet and buttocks, and there is no cleanliness and he is not provided with any kind of treatment.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha also provided the BBC with a report compiled by a doctor in Gaza, which confirmed he was still infected with scabies on the day of his release.",
      "Omar said detainees were beaten for requesting medical care.",
      "The lawyer noted that Omar needed attention for \"pimples spreading on the skin - in the groin and buttocks due to the harsh prison conditions\" including lack of toiletries and polluted water. \"The prisoner says that even when it is his turn to shower he tries to avoid it because the water\u2026 causes itching and inflammation.\"",
      "All the detainees added they had been given limited access to food and water while in detention at various facilities - several reported losing significant amounts of weight.",
      "Omar said he lost 30kg (4st 10lb). The lawyer said Omar told him food was \"almost non-existent\" in the first few months, though conditions later \"improved a little\".",
      "Mr Mushtaha described food there being left outside their caged compounds for cats and birds to eat from first.",
      "Another of our interviewees, Ahmed Abu Seif, said he was taken to a different prison - Megiddo, near the occupied West Bank, after being arrested on his 17th birthday.",
      "He said Israeli authorities would regularly storm their cells there and spray them with tear gas.",
      "\"We would feel suffocated and unable to breathe well for four days after each tear gas attack,\" according to Ahmed, who said he had been held in the prison's youth wing.",
      "\"There was no consideration of us being children, they treated us like the militants of 7 October.\"",
      "During interrogations he had his nails pulled out, he told us. When the BBC filmed him the day after his release, he showed us how several of his toenails were still affected, as well as scars on his hands he said had been caused by handcuffs and dog scratches.",
      "The IPS did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Two of the men said they had witnessed the deaths of fellow detainees in Sde Teiman and Ketziot - one through beatings, including the use of dogs, and one through medical negligence.",
      "The names and dates they gave of the incidents match media reports and accounts from human rights groups.",
      "At least 63 Palestinian prisoners - 40 of them from Gaza - have died in Israeli custody since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the BBC.",
      "The IPS did not respond to questions about deaths of Palestinians in custody, while the IDF said it was \"aware of cases of detainee deaths, including those who were detained with pre-existing illness or injury resulting from combat\".",
      "\"According to procedures, an investigation is opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) into every detainee death,\" it added.",
      "The abuse continued right up to the moment they were freed in February, some of the men said.",
      "\"On the release day, they treated us brutally. They tightened the handcuffs and when they wanted to make us move they put our hands above our heads and pulled us,\" Mr Mushtaha said.",
      "\"They said: 'If you interact with Hamas or work with Hamas, you will be targeted.' They said: 'We will send a missile directly to you.'\"",
      "Ahmed, 17, also said conditions worsened after the ceasefire deal was signed in January. \"The soldiers intensified the aggression against us knowing we were getting released soon.\"",
      "It was only once the detainees were transferred to the Red Cross bus for transportation back to Gaza that they felt \"safe\", Omar said.",
      "Footage showed some being returned in sweatshirts with the Star of David on them and the words: \"We do not forget and we do not forgive\" written in Arabic.",
      "An official at Gaza's European Hospital, which assessed the conditions of returned detainees, said skin conditions, including scabies, were common, and medics had observed many cases of \"extreme emaciation and malnutrition\" and \"the physical effects of torture\".",
      "Legal expert Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne told us: \"Certainly the use of chemicals to burn the detainee and submerge their head would meet the threshold of torture, as would the use of electric shocks, removal of toenails, and severe beatings. These, or comparable acts, have all been recognised to constitute torture by international bodies,\" as have the use of stress positions and loud music.",
      "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which conducts interviews with returning detainees, said it could not comment on individuals' conditions due to privacy concerns.",
      "It added that it was eager to be granted access to those still detained - something which has not been allowed since the 7 October attacks.",
      "\"The ICRC remains deeply concerned about the wellbeing of detainees and emphasises the urgent need for it to resume visits to all places of detention. We continue to request access in bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties,\" it told the BBC.",
      "Fifty-nine hostages are still being held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. The ICRC has never been granted access to them in their 18 months in captivity, and their loved ones have grave concerns over their wellbeing.",
      "For many of the released Palestinian detainees, returning to Gaza was both a moment of celebration and of despair.",
      "Mr Abu Tawileh said his family was shocked by his appearance when he was released, and added he was still affected by his experience.",
      "\"I am unable to do anything because of my injury, because my eye hurts, and it tears and feels itchy, and all of the burns on my body feels itchy as well. This is bothering me a lot,\" he said.",
      "Teenager Ahmed said he now wants to leave Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "More than 200 Venezuelans, who the White House alleges are gang members, have been deported from the US to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "Out of the 261 people deported, 137 were removed under the Alien Enemies Act, a senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.",
      "This broad, centuries-old law was invoked by President Donald Trump. He accused Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" on US territory.",
      "A lower court had temporarily blocked these deportations on 15 March, ruling that the administration's actions under the law needed further scrutiny. But in a 5-4 decision on 7 April, the Supreme Court lifted that block, siding with Trump while also mandating procedural safeguards.",

      "White House denies defying judge's order over deportations",
      "What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?",
      "What is the act?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without following the usual processes.",
      "It was passed as part of a series of laws in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.",
      "The act states that \"whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" against the US, all \"subjects of the hostile nation or government\" could be \"apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies\".",
      "When else has it been used?",
      "The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.",
      "It was last invoked in World War II, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "Federal judge James Boasberg attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "This led to a back-and-forth between the federal judge, located in Washington DC, and the government. Boasberg dismissed the government's response to his order as \"woefully insufficient\", and warned of consequences if the Trump administration had violated his ruling.",
      "Donald Trump hit back on social media, saying Boasberg should be impeached and calling him a  \"grandstander\".",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's original order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "The sharp fall in stock markets across the world shows no sign of letting up after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs and many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them?",
      "The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.",
      "On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls.",
      "That was most definitely a crash.",
      "In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.",
      "By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.",

      "This is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.",

      "Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.",
      "A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.",
      "How does it affect you?",
      "While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.",
      "That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.",
      "That is exactly what has happened here.",
      "Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.",
      "The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.",
      "There have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment \u2013 and pension savings is a long term game.",

    "summary": "Wigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.",
    "story": [
      "Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.",
      "Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.",
      "In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marl\u00e8ne-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.",
      "Her victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.",
      "Changes are slowly creeping in - last December Ang\u00e9lique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.",
      "But this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.",
      "Wigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).",
      "\"We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,\" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss C\u00f4te d'Ivoire organising committee, told the BBC.",
      "Ivory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.",
      "\"We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,\" he said.",
      "Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (\u00a325) to $50.",
      "\"This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.\"",
      "When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.",
      "\"I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,\" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.",
      "\"This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.\"",
      "The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.",
      "As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called \"protective style\", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.",
      "This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.",
      "\"I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,\" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.",
      "\"I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.\"",
      "The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.",
      "\"Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,\" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.",
      "\"This year, I feel more confident being myself.\"",
      "Should the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.",
      "Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.",
      "Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.",
      "\"This rule is not good for us,\" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC.",
      "\"Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.\"",
      "At her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.",
      "It shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.",
      "Natural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.",
      "It used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.",
      "According to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.",
      "\"Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,\" the trichologist told the BBC.",
      "\"These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,\" she warned.",
      "With the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.",
      "The outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was \"extraordinary\" and clearly showed it was having an impact.",
      "\"Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.\"",
      "He said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 2025.",
      "This extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.",
      "\"If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,\" Mr Yapobi said.",
      "For Doria Kor\u00e9, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: \"Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.\"",
      "Ms Dali said she was walking away with something even more valuable - self-confidence: \"I didn't win, but I feel proud. This is who I am.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:21:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Gangetic and Indus river dolphins are found in over two-dozen rivers in India.",
    "story": [
      "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.",
      "But these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.",
      "These are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.",
      "A new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.",
      "Both these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
      "Researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins.",
      "The origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists.",
      "When the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.",
      "Experts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.",
      "Conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.",
      "In 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.",
      "However, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.",
      "Dolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.",
      "Nachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble.",
      "Under Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines.",
      "River cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.",
      "\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.",
      "Mr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.",
      "River dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.",
      "Their poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.",
      "But Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on US imports on Wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 April as America's \"liberation day\".",
      "After two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the president's second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality.",
      "US stocks have been in a tailspin since Trump unveiled his tariffs at Wednesday afternoon's White House Rose Garden event, with signs that America's trading partners - Canada, the European Union and China, most notably - are not backing away from a fight.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days.",
      "The White House on Thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. The four big posters showing America's \"reciprocal\" tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between.",
      "Out on Pennsylvania Avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the White House grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-Trump demonstration at the nearby Washington Monument on Saturday. The first lady announced that a White House garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day had been postponed because of security concerns.",
      "Even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his journey to Florida.",
      "\"I said this would be exactly the way it is,\" he declared when asked about the day's stock market turmoil. The markets - and America as a whole - would soon boom, he said.",
      "The president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. He appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich American manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right.",

      "Israel has once again moved into Gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. The ceasefire that Trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with Ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory.",
      "\"If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it,\" Trump said of Russia. But he added that he still believes President Vladimir Putin wants to \"make a deal\".",
      "Evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to Jake Sullivan, who was President Joe Biden's national security adviser.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, he accused Trump of handing Russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change.",
      "\"So the current dynamic in these negotiations a) is not in fact producing Russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b) is actually stimulating a view in Moscow that if they just keep holding out, they're just going to keep getting concessions from the United States.

      "At some point, the US Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes.",

      "While the Republican candidates in Florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15%, which is about half of what Trump posted in those congressional districts in November.",
      "In Wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the Democratic-backed candidate won. Democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned there in person.",
      "Taken as a whole the results suggest that Democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against Musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff.",
      "That could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this November and the midterm congressional elections next year.",
      "The stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within Republican ranks.",
      "Ted Cruz, an arch-conservative senator from Texas, said on his podcast on Friday that Trump's tariffs \"could hurt jobs and could hurt America\" - particularly if other nations retaliate, as China has already done.",
      "\"If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs, and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, that is a terrible outcome,\" he continued.",
      "On Wednesday night in the US Senate, four Republicans joined with Democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies Trump's earlier Canada tariffs.",
      "And on Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa joined with Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington to back a measure that would require Congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days.",
      "Republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. They seem unwilling, or unable, to sway Trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vice-like grip on the party.",
      "But if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if Trump's standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years.",
      "And that would bring an unceremonious end to some of Trump's most ambitious efforts.",
      "Trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end."

      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",

      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",

      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's president has been removed from office after the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to uphold his impeachment.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duty in December after being impeached by parliament, following his failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "The ruling on Friday was met with tears of joy and sadness among Yoon's critics and supporters, who had gathered in various parts of Seoul to watch the verdict live.",
      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",
      "He cannot appeal, as the decision was made by South Korea's top court. But, having repeatedly vowed to fight to the end, he could still refuse to go quietly.",
      "The unravelling of Yoon Suk Yeol: South Korea's 'stubborn and hot-tempered' martial law president",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea.",
      "At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation.",
      "Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon's party, voted to overturn it.",
      "Yoon was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December.",
      "He is also facing separate charges for insurrection - making him South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged with a crime - which he will be trialed for at a later date. He is now on bail.",
      "Yoon is not the only South Korean politician to have faced impeachment in recent months.",

And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.",
      "Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.",
      "For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.",
      "\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"",

      "As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.",

      "The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.",

      "One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.",

      "It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.",
      "Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.",

      "Whatever happens to Agoa in the immediate term, it seems that Trump's sweeping tariffs have scuppered hopes of the legislation being renewed.",
      "The Clinton-era law, which in the current climate is beginning to feel like a relic of a bygone time, was up for renewal later this year.",
      "Since 2000, certain African countries had duty-free access to the US market for a raft of goods including clothing and textiles, cocoa products and wine, as well as crude oil.",
      "The access was tied to a number of conditions including free market policies, labour and human rights and political pluralism. Thirty-two countries from sub-Saharan Africa were eligible as of last year.",

      "If nothing changes, \"a tariff of 50% sounds like a death knell to the Agoa manufacturing in Lesotho\", says Mukhisa Kituyi, a former secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development and a former Kenyan trade minister.",
      "In 2018, the World Bank modelled a scenario where Lesotho experienced the sudden loss of Agoa privileges and found that the impact would \"reach 1% of GDP\" within two years. The report concluded that impact on welfare would be \"dramatic\".",
      "But, as witnessed with the aid cuts, arguing about the human impact or fairness will not fly in the current set-up, in the face of \"disruptive populism and post-fact, post-truth society\", Dr Kituyi argues.",
      "He thinks countries, like Kenya, that have the new tariffs set at 10%, could still try to hold ground in the US market, with the exporters and their American importers negotiating how to absorb the new taxes without raising prices for the consumer too much.",
      "As Dr Kituyi was involved in trade negotiations, including Agoa, he has seen first-hand the effort that goes into \"fine-tuning these processes\" to create a \"shared benefit from stable, predictable rules-based trading\".",

      "\"It looks like a withdrawal, an ignoring of an entire huge region of the world,\" Ms Gavin says.",
      "Coming shortly after the Trump administration severely pared back the US Agency for International Development (USAID), leading to the cancellation of both humanitarian and life-saving health assistance, the analyst says America appears to be \"destroying its own instruments of influence with abandon now\".",

    "summary": "Israeli air strikes on bases in Syria are a warning to Turkey to keep its military assets away.",
    "story": [
      "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.",
      "On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.",
      "Syria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.",
      "The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.",
      "Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.",
      "Some analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.",
      "Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.",
      "After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.",
      "But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.",
      "Syria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.",
      "He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.",
      "His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.",
      "But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.",
      "Once an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.",
      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",
      "Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.",
      "Charles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".",
      "Since the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria and the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".",
      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Syria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.",
      "At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.",
      "Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.",
      "Syrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.",
      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

    "summary": "E.A. Hanks says her father, actor Tom Hanks, was among the first to read \"The Ten,\" which traces her six-month road trip in search of answers about her late mother.",
    "story": [
      "Journalist E.A. Hanks shared that her father, actor Tom Hanks, and brother, Colin Hanks, were among the first to read her deeply personal new memoir, \"The Ten: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road,\" which details her childhood with her late mother.",
      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The book details Hanks' six-month journey along Interstate 10 from California to Florida, during which she sought to better understand Susan Dillingham \u2014 who died in 2002 \u2014 and reflect on her own difficult childhood.",
      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",
      "Hanks revealed that while growing up, she had language to understand addiction \u2014 her mother hosted 12-step programs in their home \u2014 but lacked vocabulary for mental illness.",
      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us. I had a language even from 8 years old about addiction, but there was no language for mental health and what was sort of wrong in the house,\" Hanks explained. \"A lot of the book is me trying to create that language and share it.\"",
      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",
      "She added, \"Identity and where you're from, that's the whole story. I learned that I'm the product of where I'm from.\"",

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "As of the latest CDC update on Friday, April 4, the U.S. has confirmed at least 607 measles cases so far this year, which is more than double the number of cases it saw in all of 2024. There have been cases in at least 21 states, including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and New York. The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as state health departments and the CDC continue to release data. This map is updated with new data from the CDC on Fridays.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine's safety. He is expected to launch a Make America Healthy Again tour across the southwestern U.S. early this week.",
      "Sunday, Kennedy said in a post on X that \"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\"",

      "\"We do need to have a population that is immune against measles,\" Garcia Carreno said. \"At least 95% of the population needs to be protected, either immune because of the vaccination or because they have a history of having had the infection.\"",
      "Garcia Carreno said the vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses. Babies as young as six months can get an early dose.",
      "\"Unvaccinated adults can receive the vaccine with doses at least 28 days apart,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "About 20%of unvaccinated children who get measles may need to be hospitalized, and between one to three cases in every 1,000 is fatal.",
      "\"If you get the measles and are unvaccinated, your immune system is going to be suppressed for weeks to months and seven to 10 years later, even more than that, you can have a very fatal, brain inflammation,\" Garcia Carreno said.",

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",

      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to support testing for the ongoing bird flu outbreak have been disrupted due to steep layoffs at the agency, multiple officials told CBS News Thursday, in the latest fallout from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",
      "\"Unfortunately, significant Reductions In Force (RIF), including a key quality assurance officer, at FDA's Human Food Program Moffett Center has caused immediate and significant impact on the Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network,\" read an email sent Thursday to members of the laboratory network, obtained by CBS News.",

      "The effort \"would have been critical to ensure confidence in the laboratory methods for food safety and animal health,\" the email read.",
      "Labs are testing milk both to detect the virus in sick cattle as well as for food safety purposes, an official said.",
      "The department has laid off some 10,000 workers under a plan drawn up by Kennedy and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force. The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",
      "The official said that HHS layoffs \"focused personnel cuts on redundant or unnecessary administrative positions.\"",
      "\"HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle,\" the statement said.",
      "Other federal labs have been gutted due to Kennedy's cuts, including U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs investigating STD and hepatitis outbreaks.",
      "Another disrupted bird flu effort was at the FDA's San Francisco-area food safety testing lab, two officials said.",
      "That lab is responsible for food safety testing for both humans and animals, officials said. One official said the lab had been setting up to begin testing pet food for bird flu, as part of the agency's regulatory response to outbreaks.",
      "Now the lab has been closed, with staff also completely eliminated as part of Kennedy's cuts on Tuesday. It is unclear whether the agency's remaining labs will be able to fill the gap.",
      "Several multistate recalls of pet food for bird flu contamination have been announced by health authorities in recent months, after cats and other animals were sickened. The virus has been especially lethal to pet cats.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on Monday, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier Wednesday it would\u00a0raise tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

    "summary": "U.S. tariffs on China could add hundreds of dollars to the cost an iPhone, a new analysis shows.",
    "story": [
      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "China's announcement signals Beijing isn't backing down in a global trade war sparked by Mr. Trump's April 2 decision to levy so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every nation. In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At Veterinary Emergency Group (VEG), this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG's most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer VEG hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",

      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",

      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",

    "summary": "A Senate-adopted budget resolution key to enacting President Trump's agenda is facing headwinds in the House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate's\u00a0budget resolution, which has been backed by President Trump and is key to extending his tax cuts, is opposed by a number of House Republicans who say it doesn't cut enough spending.",
      "The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",
      "The president met with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",
      "Johnson said he thought Mr. Trump helped change some minds. \"The president was very helpful and engaged. We had a lot of members whose questions were answered,\" the House speaker said after the White House meeting, adding that they're \"making great progress.\"",
      "But several holdouts said they didn't attend the meeting \u2014 or weren't invited.",
      "House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.",
      "The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of \"the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.\"",
      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",
      "He continued to put pressure on the holdouts in a Tuesday post that said, \"I AM FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS! WE ARE GOING TO DO REDUCTIONS, hopefully in excess of $1 Trillion Dollars.\"",
      "But many of the holdouts want assurances that there will be much more than $1 trillion in cuts.",
      "The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.",
      "The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.",
      "Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.",
      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.",
      "The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",
      "House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.",
      "Johnson met with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.",
      "\"It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,\" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.",
      "Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.",
      "\"They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,\" Roy said Tuesday. \"That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the hurdles ahead at the GOP leadership's news conference Tuesday morning, saying \"nobody said it would be easy.\" But the Louisiana Republican added that \"our commitment is firm in getting this done.\"",
      "\"There are members that have questions \u2014 that's not a surprise,\" Scalise said. \"Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.\"",
      "Johnson stressed that \"the budget resolution is not the law,\" noting that \"all this does is it allows us to continue the process, begin drafting the actual legislation that actually counts \u2014 and that's the one big beautiful bill.\"",
      "The speaker said adopting the resolution simply \"allows us to get off the sidelines and get on the field and start this game.\"",
      "\"It's the kickoff,\" he added.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:54:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

    "story": [
      "The U.S. will impose a 104% tariff on China beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Tuesday.",
      "Starting tomorrow, the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China, as President Trump follows through on a threat issued against Beijing on Truth Social Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products. China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in his Truth Social post that the U.S. would cease all negotiations with China, while proceeding with trade talks with other nations.",
      "China's commerce ministry on Tuesday asserted that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if Mr. Trump did not walk back his latest threat.",
      "In the press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said retaliatory tariffs on roughly 90 countries were designed to open negotiations with the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "\"To countries around the world, bring us your best offers and he will listen,\" Leavitt said of Mr. Trump. \"Deals will only be made if they benefit American workers.\"",
      "She added that 70 nations have already approached the White House to begin negotiations and presumably lower their assigned tariff rates in exchange for concessions that Mr. Trump deems beneficial to the U.S.",
      "\"On the other hand, countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate, and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers are making a mistake,\" Leavitt said.",
      "She also reiterated Mr. Trump's \"firm belief\" that the U.S. needs to prioritize the bringing of manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has a spine of steel and will not break,\" she said, later adding that \"a strong America cannot be solely dependent on foreign countries for our food, medicines and critical minerals.\"",
      "Critics of Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including some prominent Wall Street figures, say levies could stoke inflation and slow the U.S. economy.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.",

    "summary": "Small business owner Emily Ley says new U.S. tariffs on China will devastate her stationery store, calling the added costs \"catastrophic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Many U.S. small businesses could face a financial crunch as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs take effect on Wednesday, slapping new import duties on products from almost every nation across the globe.",
      "Some small businesses told CBS News they're worried about the impact from the sharp increase in tariffs that they'll soon be required to pay to the federal government. After paying the levies, they said they'll be left with two choices: raise the prices they charge customers or swallow the costs and take a financial hit.",
      "Small businesses, generally defined as enterprises with fewer than 500 employees and revenue of less than $7.5 million, account for almost half of all private-sector employment in the U.S. But they're also more vulnerable to tariff costs because they don't have the deep pockets or financial flexibility of large businesses, noted Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, which provides payroll and HR services to small and midsize businesses.",
      "\"For many small businesses, this is a one-two punch,\" Terrazas said. \"They are getting higher prices from suppliers, and their customers are more skittish\" just as they're grappling with heavier tariffs.",
      "Among those businesses reckoning with the added costs is Simplified, an online stationery business that has manufactured its colorful planners in China since 2013. Its owner, Emily Ley, told CBS News that the new reciprocal tariffs \"will have a devastating impact\" on her business, costing her an additional $630,000 in fees over the next year.",
      "On April 3, Ley filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority in dictating the import duties. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs and regulate foreign commerce.",
      "\"This additional tax burden is catastrophic to our business,\" Ley added. \"We've already raised our prices as much as possible to absorb previous tariff increases. There's a limit to how much we can increase prices before we price ourselves out of the market.\"",
      "To cope with the costs, she said the company is reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans.",
      "Recipe for a revival?",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs will revive American manufacturing by incentivizing both domestic and foreign companies to build factories in the U.S. But small businesses, which typically operate on thin margins, generally don't have the capacity to quickly shift their supply chains or build local production facilities given the higher cost of labor in the U.S.",
      "Even large businesses that have the financial heft to move its plants back to the U.S., such as Apple, would require years to build a factory in the U.S., noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 8 research note.",
      "\"Maybe over time, we will build a supplier base, but that takes time,\" Terrazas said. \"But in the interim there is this transition period that is very perilous for small businesses.\"",
      "Not all small businesses can wait that long. Alyssa Chambers, the founder of NOVA Essence Inside Out, which makes candles and other wellness products, said she plans to absorb the cost of tariffs applied to the Chinese-made candle jars and waxes she relies on \u2014 for now.",
      "Chambers said she would reassess her business' pricing toward the end of summer and depending on the state of the economy.",
      "For small businesses, buying from American manufacturers isn't really an option, Chambers added, noting that a U.S.-made candle jar costs about $12 each. By contrast, she can buy a 15-pack of jars made in China for about $20. Although she expects that price to rise to about $40 after the tariffs hit home, it's still cheaper than buying domestically.",
      "Other small businesses simply don't have the option of buying from domestic manufacturers, said Matt Weyandt, co-founder of chocolate maker Xocolatl. Because cocoa is grown near the equator, very little of it can be grown in the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"Despite that, we'll now be paying an additional 10% or more for all of our cocoa beans on top of their already elevated prices,\" Weyandt said. \"This is not going to bring cocoa farming jobs to the U.S. or increase American manufacturing \u2014 it's just going to hurt American chocolate manufacturers.\"",
      "To be sure, there are some small businesses that could continue to thrive even with higher tariffs Terrazas said. That includes domestic food manufacturers or health care businesses that don't rely on imports, such as elder or child care companies.",
      "Skittish consumers",
      "Small businesses are coping with the tariffs just as Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low last month.",
      "\"In the long term, American consumers are really remarkable. But in the short term, it's hard,\" said Kevin Klowden, an economist with the Milken Institute, a think tank. \"It is definitely different because this is an intent to force a structural shift.\"",
      "But, Klowden added, Mr. Trump is doing so \"by significantly putting pressure on the cost structure of the entire system.\"",
      "Whether inflation-weary consumers will accept price hikes from businesses remains to be seen. If the tariffs aren't reduced, inflation could pick up this year, reaching as high as 4% by year end, up from about 2.8% currently, according to Wall Street economists.",
      "\"This is a moment of elevated risk for the economy,\" Terrazas said.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:18:39 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect Wednesday. Here's what to know about the import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced last week\u00a0\u2014 an import tax blitz on long-standing global trade partners he referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The additive tariffs were unveiled alongside an across-the-board levy of 10% on\u00a0dozens of nations and territories, from major exporters to the U.S. such as China to the British-controlled Falkland Islands, which has fewer than 4,000 residents.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in the April 2 news conference, touting the tariffs as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with countries he said impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But economists note that that in addition to roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses, the tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners are hard to structure.",
      "While the 10% baseline tariffs on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on April 5, the reciprocal levies are\u00a0 set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But applying tariffs that match other countries' exactly would be an administratively complex task given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products, noted Jacquez.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" he said.",
      "Other experts have suggested that Trump's goal behind the levies is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S., or generating federal revenue, than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals with the Trump administration.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-specific tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs across the board, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on April said his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. In calculating the percentage of taxes charged by each nation on U.S. exports, the White House said it included not just levies, but all trade practices on a country-by-country basis that it deemed unfair, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Mr. Trump characterized the discounted tariff rates as \"kind.\"",
      "For example, the U.S. said it would match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. China retaliated last week, saying it would impose its own\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, to which Mr. Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. If Mr. Trump carries through with the threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "At 50%, Lesotho, an African nation, and French territories Saint Pierre and Miquelon face the highest country-specific tariff rates. Vietnam, where Apple produces some of its iPhones, is subject to a 46% tariff under Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration, anticipated that the White House would \"come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods.\"",
      "As a result, the U.S. would tax some other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours, in a scenario Jacquez predicted would lead to retaliation against the U.S.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",

      "While the levies have not yet gone into effect, experts say any reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "Consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply for products for which there are no comparable substitutes.",
      "\"The more price-insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",
      "Prices could also fall later on, if Mr. Trump lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations, he noted.",

      "Mega Millions has rolled out several changes, including new ticket prices, jackpots and an increase in the odds of winning, according to the multistate lottery game. The first drawing under the changes is set for later today.",
      "How much is a Mega Millions ticket?",
      "Players now need more than $2 and a dream to win. After last Friday's drawing, tickets now cost $5 each, Mega Millions said in a statement. An optional add-on to potentially increase nonjackpot prizes for an additional dollar and a $3 feature for two plays for just the jackpot have been discontinued.",
      "What are the new Mega Millions odds?",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize have improved from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize are still astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336. The change makes the odds of winning Mega Millions' jackpot closer to winning Powerball's, where the odds\u00a0are 1 in 292.2 million.",
      "One thing that hasn't changed is people are still less likely to win the jackpot than to be struck by lightning, the odds of which are 1 in 15,300 in a lifetime, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Players win a Mega Millions jackpot by matching the five white balls and the gold Mega Ball. The game's smallest prize is won by matching just the Mega Ball. The changes in the game's odds come from removing one of the Mega Balls.",
      "The size of the prizes are also changing. The jackpot will be a minimum of $50 million, up from $20 million. Mega Millions estimates that the average jackpot win with the new changes will be over $800 million, an increase from about $450 million. A random multiplier will also be added to the smaller prizes.",
      "\"Players who had won $2 in the old game will now take home $10, $15, $20, $25 or $50 under this game,\" Joshua Johnston, lead director of the Mega Millions Consortium, said in a statement. \"Those who had won $500 under the old rules will now take home $1,000; $1,500; $2,000; $2,500 or $5,000 in this new game.\"",
      "When does Mega Millions draw?",
      "Mega Millions drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays at 11 p.m. Eastern time. Tickets are sold in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",

      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "Ackman said that the\u00a0reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"",
      "As a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.",
      "He took aim at Mr. Trump directly, saying \"The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe\" and that if he doesn't pause the tariffs from going into effect, the U.S. is headed for a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\"",
      "Tariff \"errors\"",
      "Other prominent investors that are chiming in include billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Family Office, who wrote in a\u00a0social media\u00a0post, \"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\"",
      "And hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, CEO of Third Point, on X posted an American Enterprise Institute analysis of Mr. Trump's tariff formula, which he said highlighted its \"conceptual as well as practical errors.\"",
      "\"It will be a test of the administration's judgment versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days,\" Loeb wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Financial markets landed with a thud Friday as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",

    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",

      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on Monday, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier Wednesday it would\u00a0raise tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",

      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",

John Sauer said the district court orders reinstating Cathy Harris to her role on the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the removals unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",
      "The bid for the Supreme Court's intervention comes as the justices have been faced with a flurry of requests for emergency relief from the Trump administration. More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that Mr. Trump's firings of them were unlawful. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",

      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judges in New York and Texas temporarily blocked the deportations of certain Venezuelan migrants facing removal under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is trying to break through Republican opposition that's threatening a budget plan that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, he told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version.\u00a0The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, with a possible floor vote later in the day, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "The dynamic comes as the congressional leaders have pushed to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution the House is now considering. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process, and didn't say how he'd vote.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",

We'd have to go \u2026 the cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president ordered.\"",
      "LaPook provided Kennedy with an example of a $750,000 University of Michigan grant focused on adolescent diabetes, which was eliminated.",
      "\"I didn't know that, and that's something that we'll look at,\" Kennedy said. He added that he could not speak to if it should be considered a DOGE cut.",
      "\"I just, I'm not familiar with that particular study. But there's a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that's important.\"",

What Elon said is that, when you do a disruption of this, a lot of times, 80% of the people that get cut ... You may make mistakes, as much as 20[%], and then you go back and remedy that.\"",
      "With billions of dollars in cuts at stake, Kennedy addressed the cost of health care.",
      "\"People have a choice about how sick they are going to be, many people. If you don't have any choice, then we should give you all the resources that you want, but I mean... it's a moral question too, and it's a philosophical question,\" the secretary said. \"If you're smoking three packs of cigarettes a day, should you expect society to pay when you get sick?\"",

As we focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer, we are also in the midst of breaking down data silos that for too long have stood in the way of identifying waste, fraud, and abuse and bringing criminals to justice,\" a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Krause is planning to resign after opting into the agency's recently offered Deferred Resignation Program, the source told CBS News on Tuesday. The Washington Post was the first to report on her resignation.",
      "Krause could leave as soon as April 28.",
      "Kathleen Walters, the IRS chief privacy officer, Teresa Hunter, IRS chief financial officer, and Mike Wetklow, IRS chief risk officer, are also leaving the agency, two sources familiar with the situation said. Walters' departure is through the Deferred Resignation Program as well and is related to the Department of Homeland Security-data sharing agreement, one source said.",
      "Late Monday, the IRS disclosed its memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security in a court filing in a lawsuit filed by Public Citizen, which seeks to bar the Treasury Department from disclosing tax return information to immigration enforcement authorities.",
      "According to the exhibit, the IRS will review all requests and account for disclosures made under the memorandum. While some of the memo is highly redacted, it reveals that the IRS will disclose to ICE the names and addresses of immigrants, among other information.",
      "The new data-sharing arrangement will allow ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally with their IRS tax records.",
      "Treasury argues that the agreement will help carry out President Trump's agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Advocates say the IRS-DHS information sharing agreement violates longstanding privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the agency's thinking on the agreement said the basis for the agreement is founded in \"longstanding authorities granted by Congress, which serve to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals.\"",
      "Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, told reporters at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix on Tuesday that the agreement would help ICE find people who are collecting benefits they aren't entitled to and are \"kind of hiding in plain sight\" using someone else's identity.",
      "Working with Treasury and other departments is \"strictly for the major criminal cases,\" Lyons said.",
      "The IRS has already been called upon once to help with immigration enforcement earlier this year.",
      "Noem in February sent a request to Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS' boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back.",
      "Tax law experts for the NYU Tax Law Center wrote Monday that the agreement \"threatens to violate the rights that many more Americans have under longstanding laws that protect their tax information from wrongful disclosure or dissemination.\"",
      "\"In fact, it is difficult to see how the IRS could release information to DHS while complying with taxpayer privacy statutes,\" they said, \"IRS officials who sign off on data sharing under these circumstances risk breaking the law, which could result in criminal and civil sanctions.\"",

Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024. A member of Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail spotted his rifle in the tree line and opened fire at the suspect, who didn't fire back. He fled by car, and Routh was detained about 50 miles north of the golf course.",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation on March 14 invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants who are allegedly members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority, but clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. But the same day,\u00a0three flights\u00a0carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men \u2014 137 of whom were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "The March 15 order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court\u00a0on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to lift the lower court orders.",
      "On Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation. Top White House officials had argued migrants subject to deportation under the law are not entitled to due process. But, the Supreme Court said on April 7 that going forward, Alien Enemies Act detainees must receive notice \"that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" and the notice must allow them to challenge their detention.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

      "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 China said Tuesday it would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.'s imposition of \"so-called 'reciprocal tariffs'\" on China was \"completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.\"",
      "China, the world's second-largest economy, has imposed retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.",
      "\"The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,\" the ministry said. \"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens and economists have warned that the odds of a global recession are rising fast.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.",
      "\"If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" the president wrote on his own Truth Social platform. \"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\"",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union.",
      "European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on China to negotiate with the EU to come up with solutions to the global challenges presented by the sweeping U.S. tariffs.",
      "During a phone call with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday, Von der Leyen \"stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field,\" according to a statement from her office.",
      "The statement said the leaders had discussed establishing a mechanism to track any diversions of goods caused by the U.S. levies on trade, amid concern in Europe that China could try to divert cheap exports that had been destined for the U.S. to the EU market. Such diversions could amount to what is called \"dumping\" in international trade, a practice that can saturate a market with underpriced goods at the expense of domestic producers and sellers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate's\u00a0budget resolution, which has been backed by President Trump and is key to extending his tax cuts, is opposed by a number of House Republicans who say it doesn't cut enough spending.",
      "The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",
      "The president met with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",
      "Johnson said he thought Mr. Trump helped change some minds. \"The president was very helpful and engaged. We had a lot of members whose questions were answered,\" the House speaker said after the White House meeting, adding that they're \"making great progress.\"",
      "But several holdouts said they didn't attend the meeting \u2014 or weren't invited.",
      "House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.",
      "The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of \"the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.\"",
      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",
      "He continued to put pressure on the holdouts in a Tuesday post that said, \"I AM FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS! WE ARE GOING TO DO REDUCTIONS, hopefully in excess of $1 Trillion Dollars.\"",
      "But many of the holdouts want assurances that there will be much more than $1 trillion in cuts.",
      "The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.",
      "The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.",
      "Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.",
      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.",
      "The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",
      "House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.",
      "Johnson met with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.",
      "\"It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,\" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.",
      "Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.",
      "\"They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,\" Roy said Tuesday. \"That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the hurdles ahead at the GOP leadership's news conference Tuesday morning, saying \"nobody said it would be easy.\" But the Louisiana Republican added that \"our commitment is firm in getting this done.\"",
      "\"There are members that have questions \u2014 that's not a surprise,\" Scalise said. \"Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.\"",
      "Johnson stressed that \"the budget resolution is not the law,\" noting that \"all this does is it allows us to continue the process, begin drafting the actual legislation that actually counts \u2014 and that's the one big beautiful bill.\"",

    "summary": "The executive orders are meant to reenergize the coal industry, which has been steadily declining for years.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed four executive actions on Tuesday aimed at reversing policies that transitioned the country away from coal production and aimed at boosting America's \"beautiful clean coal industry,\" as the White House put it.",
      "The actions are meant to help the U.S. achieve affordable and reliable energy by \"slashing unnecessary regulations,\" Mr. Trump said. The president said he's using the Defense Production Act to \"turbocharge\" coal mining in America. Mr. Trump also said his administration is working through the legalities of making it harder for companies to shut down coal plants.",
      "\"Today, we're taking historic action to help American workers, miners, families and consumers,\" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room, flanked by men in coal mining uniforms and hard hats. \"We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all. And it wasn't just Biden, it was Obama, and there were others. But we're doing the exact opposite. And all those plants that have been closed are going to be opened.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has had a long affinity for coal, as previous Democratic administrations and many developed nations have worked to move away from the fossil fuel toward renewable resources. The term \"clean coal\" typically refers to processes designed to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, but environmental groups say any coal combustion is harmful.",
      "The president's move Tuesday defines coal as a \"mineral,\" which the administration says will give it more leeway on its use. The government has traditionally classified it as a nonrenewable fossil fuel. One of the executive orders directs agencies to lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands and prioritize coal leasing, formally ending an Obama-era moratorium against coal leasing on federal land. The president also directed federal agencies to rescind any policies transitioning the country away from coal production.",
      "Another executive order the president signed Tuesday is meant to promote grid reliability, including by using fossil fuels. And yet another executive order Mr. Trump signed Tuesday directs the Justice Department to investigate states that are discriminating against coal.",
      "\"For years, people would just bemoan this industry and decimate the industry for absolutely no reason, because with modern technology and all of the other things that we do, it's one of the great, great forms of energy,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to harness U.S. coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power, and this executive order is one of a number of actions he has taken to reverse Obama and Biden administration energy policies. The president has also withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, and declared a national emergency on energy, and he ended predecessor Joe Biden's efforts to encourage widespread EV adoption.",
      "The president said coal miners want to mine coal, not work in high-tech jobs or other fields.",
      "\"You could give 'em a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and a different kind of job, and they'd be unhappy,\" Mr. Trump said, with the miners behind him. \"They want to mine coal. That's what they love to do.\"",
      "But despite Mr. Trump's emphasis on coal in his first term, coal production decreased slightly between 2016 before he took office and 2020, his final full year in office, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And, in keeping with a trend in declining coal employment, there were fewer Americans working in the coal industry in January 2020 ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic than there were in January 2017 when he took office, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "No new coal plant has come online since 2013, during the Obama years, and the average age of the current fleet is 53 years old. Currently,\u00a0coal makes up about 16%\u00a0of the electricity mix in the U.S., down from 50% two decades ago.",
      "As of this year, only about 41,000 Americans work in the coal industry. By comparison, solar energy employed nearly 280,000 Americans in 2023, according to the National Solar Job Census.",
      "Environmental groups suggested Mr. Trump's executive order to reinvigorate coal will be a step backward.",
      "\"What's next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?\" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the National Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.",
      "\"Trump's coal orders take his worship of dirty fossil fuels to a gross and disturbingly reckless new level,\" said Jason Rylander of the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. \"Forcing old coal plants to keep spewing pollution into our air and water means more cancer, more asthma and more premature deaths.\"",

      "President Trump's debt to New York from a civil fraud judgment passed $500 million on Tuesday, as interest continues to accrue while he appeals.",
      "The figure has been growing ever since a lengthy civil fraud trial ended with Mr. Trump, two of his sons and a former Trump Organization executive ordered to pay back $364 million in disgorgement for \"ill-gotten gains\" and $100 million more in interest dating back years.",
      "They appealed the February 2024 judgment but interest has continued to build, at a rate of more than $114,000 per day. The total for all defendants hit $500 million on Dec. 29.",
      "That figure is now nearly $512 million, and Mr. Trump's personal share \u2014 98% of the total judgment \u2014 was at $500,070,167.42 on Tuesday morning, according to a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the case against Trump and others.",
      "James's office has said the judgement reflects the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud. The defendants were accused of a multi-year scheme to cheat banks and insurers by inflating property valuations and estimates of Mr. Trump's wealth.",
      "James declined to comment Tuesday. Attorneys for Mr. Trump did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "Judge Arthur Engoron said evidence proved \"over and over again\" that the defendants provided \"blatantly false financial data\" to Mr. Trump's business partners.

      "Soon after the judgment, Trump and his co-defendants brought the case to New York's Appellate Division, First Department. In September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel appeared skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",

      "Bacon argued that the Constitution is clear on the issue, giving Congress \"the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch,\" which he called a \"mistake.\"",
      "Bacon's bill is companion legislation to a measure introduced in the Senate last week by Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The Trade Review Act of 2025 would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to cancel the tariff with a joint resolution.",
      "\"We have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate,\" Bacon said, adding that he plans to unveil his House bill, with some beginning support, on Monday.",
      "Bacon thinks the legislation will be difficult to pass in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority, but he believes that there are scenarios that would ease its path.",
      "\"I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate, they'll put pressure on the House to look at this,\" Bacon said. \"And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction, or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.\"",
      "On Sunday, the White House Budget Office said Mr. Trump would veto an attempt to curb his tariff power.",
      "Mr. Trump announced 10% tariffs on imports from all countries last week, as well as higher levies effective this week on dozens of countries that have trade surpluses with the U.S. Meanwhile, the president urged Americans to \"hang tough\" as financial markets saw their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Bacon said the bill \"will not pass tomorrow or maybe in the next couple weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use.\"",
      "Cantwell, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said seven Republicans signed on as cosponsors on the first day the Senate measure was introduced.",
      "\"So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board, but I think it shows the anxiety that people have,\" Cantwell said, while noting that industry groups have also backed the effort.",
      "But whether the measure will get a vote in the GOP-led Senate remains to be seen. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Senate Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said the Senate legislation \"will get a thorough hearing.\"",

      "\"China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding, \"It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president.\"",

      "In addition to a universal baseline tariff of 10% on goods imported into the U.S., Mr. Trump also announced \"reciprocal\" duties for imports coming from certain countries, which are set to take effect Wednesday. China was hit with the highest of those additional taxes, initially 34%, although Mr. Trump then upped it to 104% after Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",

    "story": [
      "Tattoos of crowns, a clock and other symbols have been used by the Trump administration to allege Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But experts and police in a Colorado city who have investigated the gang say tattoos aren't reliable markers of affiliation.",
      "The administration alleges the deportees it sent to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison are gang members, mostly with Tren de Aragua, and some with MS-13. It has also acknowledged that \"many\" of them have no criminal records.",
      "President Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act, claiming Tren de Aragua is invading the United States, to deport many of the men. The administration also declared Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization.",
      "Court documents, lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have said their tattoos were reasons they were determined to be alleged Tren de Aragua members.",
      "The wife of Franco Jose Caraballo, a barber from Venezuela with no criminal record, said officers kept asking questions about his tattoo of a pocket watch that marks the time of their daughter's birth.",
      "A lawyer for Caraballo says he's not a gang member and his wife said he is innocent when asked what worries her about his detention in the Salvadoran prison.",
      "Another man, Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, has crown tattoos over the words \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" Hern\u00e1ndez Romero is a makeup artist who identifies as gay. He faced discrimination and threats in Venezuela because of his sexual orientation and political views and was seeking asylum in the U.S., his attorney said in a court filing.",
      "A questionnaire, used in correctional facilities to assess potential gang affiliation, appears to show that Hern\u00e1ndez Romero's tattoos were the only basis to allegedly connect him to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member,\" an officer wrote in the filing.",
      "Many experts disagree that tattoos can identify members of the gang.",
      "\"Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang,\" Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, told 60 Minutes.",
      "Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Florida, wrote in a court filing for the case that there are no tattoos, symbols or hand gestures associated with the group.",
      "\"The TdA, and gangs more generally in Venezuela, do not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership,\" she said. \"TdA members may, of course, have tattoos, but this is not part of a collective identity.\"",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, which Mr. Trump has claimed is a \"war zone\" overrun by the Tren de Aragua, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said it's very difficult to identify Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Chamberlain said he would not describe the city as a \"war zone,\" but said Aurora has been \"ground zero\" for the gang's activities. The city saw organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes, one of which is now shuttered.",
      "The Aurora Police Department likely has the best understanding of the Tren de Aragua gang of any U.S. law enforcement agency, he said.",
      "\"It's unlike MS-13, it's unlike a Crip or a Blood,\" he said. \"If you go back to gangs in the early '80s or the '90s again, the way they walked, the way they talked, what they wore, they had very obvious signs.\"",
      "But Tren de Aragua does not, he said.",
      "Rather than focusing on trying to identify gang members, Chamberlain said his department has focused on criminal activity.",
      "\"For us, it wasn't about what gang they were involved in. It's about what criminal activity they were involved in, and we knew that there was criminal activity,\" he said. \"If we could connect it to TdA as we were evolving this process, that's great.\"",
      "Chamberlain said his department counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "Jeanette Rodriguez, who serves as a liaison between local law enforcement and the Venezuelan migrant community in Aurora, said Tren de Aragua members don't flaunt obvious signs of gang membership.",
      "\"If you compare it to like MS-13, they're very proud of who they are, and they would tattoo them on their faces, and are very proud of who they are. Tren de Aragua, they know the value of laying low,\" she said.",
      "Hanson noted that the Trump administration's partial reliance on tattoos to conclude migrants are members of Tren de Aragua \"appears to result from an incorrect conflation of gang practices in Central America and Venezuela.\"",
      "It's different than in El Salvador and Honduras, where \"gangs have long used tattoos to indicate membership and identity,\" she said.",
      "At CECOT, the El Salvador prison, many of the inmates have prominent tattoos. One, Marvin Vazquez, who is an MS-13 member, said \"you gotta kill\" to get a tattoo like the \"MS\" ones he showed on his chest and abdomen.",
      "Vazquez was arrested in El Salvador after the government declared war on the gangs in 2022.",
      "Gustavo Villatoro, El Salvador's minister of justice and public security, said tattoos are one way the government identifies gang members. He said not all the prisoners in CECOT have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Top White House officials have argued the Trump administration does not need to follow due process to remove individuals from the U.S. under the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act. However, on Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court said detainees must receive notice that they are subject to removal under the law and must be allowed to challenge their detention.",
      "Asked if he was worried some migrants were incorrectly identified as gang members, Mr. Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan said he's not.",
      "\"I'll trust the men and women at ICE,\" Homan said. \"I've been assured numerous times that everybody in that plane from Venezuela was a TdA member. The rest of 'em were MS-13.\"",

    "summary": "More than 16,000 probationary workers at six different agencies were fired in mid-February.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to halt a lower court order that required six federal agencies to rehire more than 16,000 probationary workers who had been fired.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration, which sought to move forward with its efforts to drastically scale back the size of the federal government as legal proceedings continue. In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court said the injunction issued by the district court in mid-March \"was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations'\" legal right to sue, a concept known as standing.",
      "Its stay will remain in place will litigation plays out. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would have denied the Justice Department's request for relief.",
      "Probationary workers, generally those who were still in one or two-year trial periods, were the early targets of mass firings that are part of President Trump's government-cutting initiative. Many have been left in limbo since mid-February, when they were fired and then had their employment restored weeks later as a result of court orders.",
      "Labor unions and nonprofit groups that brought the lawsuit challenging the firings vowed to continue fighting for probationary workers.",
      "\"There is no doubt that thousands of public service employees were unlawfully fired in an effort to cripple federal agencies and their crucial programs that serve millions of Americans every day,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"Today's order by the U.S. Supreme Court is deeply disappointing but is only a momentary pause in our efforts to enforce the trial court's orders and hold the federal government accountable.\"",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after thousands of probationary workers received notices that they had been terminated. The letters, many of which used similar language, based the firings on individual performance, though federal workers argued in court filings that they had received positive performance reviews.",
      "In response to the firings, a group of labor unions and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit in federal district court in California. The lawsuit claimed that the Office of Personnel Management directed the mass terminations of probationary workers, acting outside of its authority.",
      "In late February, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued a temporary restraining order deeming earlier guidance from OPM to federal agencies about the firing of probationary workers \"illegal\" and invalid. The judge also concluded that the mass firings were likely unlawful.",
      "On the heels of that decision, OPM acting director Charles Ezell issued revised guidance clarifying that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"",
      "Following a hearing last month, the judge ordered six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affair \u2014 to immediately offer reinstatement to all probationary workers who were fired the previous month.",
      "Human resources officials at the half-a-dozen agencies told the court that they had rehired the fired employees and placed them on administrative leave before returning them to full-duty status.",
      "The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause that decision while it appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the request.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district judge did not have the power to grant reinstatement to thousands of probationary workers, and refuted that OPM had directed the firings in the first place.",
      "\"An order directing reinstatement of thousands of employees across six agencies is intolerable,\" she wrote in a filing. \"The injunction appears to prevent the agencies from terminating the employees based on an exercise of the agencies' independent judgment \u2014 and would even seem to prevent the employees' termination based on newly arising grounds like new instances of poor performance or misconduct without, at a minimum, obtaining permission from the district court.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, told the justices that Alsup's order is a \"profound invasion\" of the executive branch's ability to direct its internal affairs.",
      "She also warned that the reinstatements have posed logistical burdens that require significant resources, and said that the obligation to pay the fired probationary employees \"inflicts massive financial costs\" that cannot be recovered.",
      "\"Each day the preliminary injunction remains in effect subjects the Executive Branch to judicial micromanagement of its day-to-day operations,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the unions and organizations challenging the firings said that the harms alleged by the government are self-inflicted.",
      "\"While the government complains that the reinstatement of more than 16,000 employees at the six covered agencies is an 'enormous' task that would interfere with agency functioning (without presenting evidence supporting that assertion), the scale of the task is simply a reflection of the scale of the Government's own unlawful action and its 'move fast and break things' ethos,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote in a filing.",
      "They called OPM's directives \"hasty and sloppy,\" and said that the government can still fire employees, as long as it complies with the law.",
      "\"The district court's reinstatement merely orders the government to return to the situation that existed before it embarked on illegal mass termination of probationary employees,\" the legal team for the unions and nonprofits wrote. \"If there are 'practical burdens' associated with the return to the status quo, they are of the government's own making.\"",
      "The case brought by the unions and groups is one of two challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. A group of 19 states filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland arguing the terminations were unlawful, and in March, a judge ordered affected probationary workers at more than a dozen agencies be reinstated.",
      "The judge then granted a preliminary injunction in early April, which applies to probationary workers at 20 agencies who live or work in the states involved in the lawsuit.",

They were typically given notices to appear in immigration court, to begin the asylum process, as well as a two-year grant of immigration parole, which allowed them to work in the U.S. lawfully. The policy was designed to dissuade migrants from crossing the border unlawfully.",
      "But the Trump administration has started sending notices to those who entered through the CBP One system, informing them that their parole status is being terminated over 7 days.",
      "\"If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States \u2014 unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here,\" the message sent by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by CBS News reads.",
      "The notification encourages migrants to sign up for self-deportation through the very same app that allowed them to enter the U.S. It is now called CBP Home.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice says. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the status cancellations, saying in a statement to CBS News that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"has full authority to revoke parole.\"",
      "\"Canceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,\" the department added. \"Formal termination notices have been issued, and affected aliens are urged to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home App. Those who refuse will be found, removed, and permanently barred from reentry.\"",
      "The Trump administration's actions should not immediately affect migrants who entered via CBP One and applied for asylum and have pending cases in immigration court. The government generally has to wait for those cases to be adjudicated or terminated before moving to deport them.",
      "The move to strip those who entered under the app of their legal status is the latest effort by the Trump administration to dismantle Biden-era immigration programs and expand the pool of migrants eligible to be arrested and deported.",

      "He stole to support his addiction, cycled in and out of jail and treatment, and overdosed 10 times, he said. His mother once gave him CPR on their bathroom floor.",
      "Life was \"hell on Earth,\" said Julian, now 43 and in long-term recovery.",
      "Like tens of thousands of others who have suffered similarly, Julian filed claims for compensation from pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis.",
      "Earlier this year, he received his first payout: $324.58.",
      "That's enough to fill his car with gas about eight times or pay about a tenth of the rent for an apartment he shares with his fiancee and two children.",
      "Meanwhile, Maine's Cumberland County, where Julian lives, has received more than $700,000 in opioid settlement money and expects nearly $1.6 million more in the coming years, according to a newly updated database from KFF Health News. Jurisdictions throughout his state have received more than $68 million to date, and governments nationwide have raked in upward of $10 billion, the database shows.",
      "That discrepancy between individuals' and governments' compensations highlights a sense of injustice felt by people directly affected by the crisis who say their suffering is the reason that governments secured these settlements.",
      "Opioid settlements with companies like Purdue Pharma, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson have led to headline-grabbing multibillion-dollar payouts, but most of the windfall is flowing to state and local governments, not directly to victims of the crisis.",
      "Only a handful of companies \u2014 those that filed for bankruptcy, including Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt, Endo, and Rite Aid \u2014 have set aside payouts for individuals. To qualify, people must have filed claims within a certain window and provided documents proving they were prescribed painkillers from that company. Even then, many victims will receive just a few thousand dollars, lawyers and advocates estimate. Most of these companies have not started paying yet, so victims might have to wait months or years more before seeing the cash.",
      "In contrast, state and local governments have already received settlement\u00a0money. To understand the size of those payouts, KFF Health News in January downloaded data from BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, and used it to update a searchable database that allows users to determine how much their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Governments are receiving that money because attorneys general argued that their states' public safety, health, and social service systems were harmed by the opioid crisis. Jurisdictions are supposed to spend settlement money on addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. But many affected individuals and families say governments have failed to adhere to that mission.",
      "\"At the very minimum, they could spend these dollars right to prevent the future loss of life,\" said Ryan Hampton, a national recovery advocate and previous co-chair of a committee in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, where he represented victims. \"That is the opposite of what we've seen to date.\"",
      "In Pennsylvania, a group of bereaved family members raised similar concerns to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who finalized opioid settlements when he was attorney general.",
      "\"Instead of directing funds toward evidence-based solutions, you and your administration have allowed counties to divert these resources into law enforcement, ineffective programs, and initiatives that already have other funding streams available \u2014 disrespecting both our families and the lives lost,\" they wrote in a letter dated Feb. 14. \"Meanwhile, bereaved families \u2014 many of whom have lost everything \u2014 have no financial relief.\"",
      "\"Governments were way more powerful\"",
      "To be sure, many governments have spent millions of settlement dollars on treatment programs, recovery supports, distribution of overdose reversal medications, and other efforts. Some officials in charge of the money say those services, which reach many residents, can have a greater impact than individual payouts.",
      "Will Simons, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that the Shapiro administration has invested nearly $90 million of settlement funds into treatment, recovery, harm reduction, and prevention initiatives, including prevention programs for youths, a drug and alcohol call center, and loan repayment programs aimed at retaining workers in the addiction treatment and recovery field.",
      "Many of the awarded organizations \"support families who have lost loved ones to this crisis, providing counseling and other family supports,\" Simons said.",
      "A few jurisdictions have created fairly modest funds directed at individuals, such as one in Boston to aid families who have lost loved ones to addiction, and a fund in Alabama for grandparents having to raise children because of parental substance use.",
      "But nationwide, there's little that resembles the widespread cash payments that many advocates, like Hampton, originally envisioned.",
      "In the mid-2010s, Hampton said, he and other advocates considered filing class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies but realized they didn't have the resources.",
      "A few years later, when state attorneys general began pursuing cases against those companies, victims were thrilled, thinking they would finally get compensation alongside their governments. Hampton and other advocates held rallies, shared their stories publicly, and galvanized support for the states' lawsuits.",
      "In 2019, when Hampton became co-chair of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy and arrived at the negotiating table with state attorneys general and other entities, he thought \"everybody was there to take on the big bad pharmaceutical company and to put victims' interests first,\" he said. But as the negotiation proceeded among various creditors vying for the company's assets, he said, \"governments were way more powerful than victims and believed that they were more harmed than victims in terms of cost.\"",
      "Details of the Purdue settlement are still being finalized, and payments are unlikely to start until next year, but estimates suggest state and local governments will receive the lion's share, while more than 100,000 victims will split a fraction of the bankruptcy payout.",
      "Mallinckrodt, a manufacturer of generic opioids, is the only company that had begun paying victims as of early 2025, said Frank Younes, a partner at the Nebraska-based law firm High & Younes, which is representing personal injury claimants in several opioid bankruptcies.",
      "After paying roughly 25% in administrative fees to the national trust overseeing the bankruptcy and an additional 40% in attorney fees, some of his clients have received between $400 and $700, Younes said.",
      "He expects payouts from two other companies \u2014 Endo and Rite Aid \u2014 \"will be even lower.\"",
      "But many victims won't receive anything. Some didn't know they could file claims until it was too late. Others struggled to obtain medical records from shuttered doctors' offices or pharmacies that didn't retain older documents.",
      "Out of nearly 20,000 people who contacted Younes' firm to participate in the various opioid bankruptcies, he said, only about 3,500 were able to file.",
      "\"Do something for these families\"",
      "John McNerney was told his Purdue Pharma claim didn't qualify, because he hadn't been prescribed enough OxyContin to meet the threshold. He submitted claims for Mallinckrodt and Endo instead.",
      "McNerney, 60, who lives in Boca Raton, Florida, said he suffered a spinal injury decades ago from a fall during a plumbing repair. For years afterward, he was prescribed various painkillers. Once his doctors cut him off, he began using pills a friend bought off the street. McNerney spent about $30,000 on rehabs before he entered long-term recovery.",
      "Now when he sees governments spending settlement money on police cars or library books about addiction \"instead of putting 100% of it into rehab,\" he said, \"it really bothers the heck out of me.\"",
      "\"I haven't received a nickel,\" he said.",
      "In Ohio, a group of affected families were similarly frustrated that money wasn't reaching them or the places where they thought it was needed most.",
      "The families teamed up with local nonprofits to submit grant applications to the OneOhio Recovery Foundation, which controls most of the state's opioid settlement funds. They asked for several million dollars to put toward family support groups, training for family members who take in children whose parents have substance use disorders, and emergency cash aid for families to buy cribs or school supplies and cover funeral costs.",
      "Jackie Lewis, a member of the group, said that when her 34-year-old son, Shaun, died of an overdose, she had to pay his funeral costs by credit card. She has filed a claim in the opioid bankruptcies but hasn't received any money yet.",
      "\"Too many families didn't have a credit card to do that with,\" Lewis said. \"There are families I've talked to that couldn't do flowers. Some had to do a cremation instead of a traditional funeral.\"",
      "Her group did not receive funding in the first round of grants from the OneOhio Recovery Foundation.",
      "Connie Luck, a spokesperson for the foundation, said the legal documents that established the foundation do not allow direct payments to individuals affected by the crisis. The foundation has awarded over $45 million to 245 projects throughout the state, including dozens that provide family support services like child care and rental assistance.",
      "\"We deeply empathize with those who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic \u2014 their pain is real, and it fuels the Foundation's mission to end this crisis and prevent it from happening again,\" Luck said in a statement.",
      "In Maine, Julian has made peace with his $325 payout, deciding to consider it a surprise bonus rather than compensation for his years of suffering.",
      "But he hopes governments will use their more substantial sums to provide real help \u2014 food and rental assistance for people in recovery and more treatment beds so no one has to wait six months to enter rehab as he once did.",
      "\"They're getting millions of dollars,\" said Julian, who has lost numerous close friends to overdose. \"They could do something for these families that have suffered great losses.\"",

      "METHODOLOGY",
      "For more than two years, KFF Health News has been tracking how state and local governments use \u2014 and misuse \u2014 billions of dollars in opioid settlement funds. This database marks our third update of data showing how much money state and local governments have received through national settlements with companies that made or distributed prescription painkillers.",
      "BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, tracks how much money it has delivered to various state and local governments, as well as how much is allocated to those jurisdictions for future years. It initially kept this information private.",
      "In 2023, KFF Health News negotiated to obtain that information and made it public for the first time. Five months later, BrownGreer began posting updated versions of the information on a public website.",
      "Last year, KFF Health News downloaded BrownGreer's data on payouts from pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen (now called Cencora), Cardinal Health, and McKesson, as well as opioid manufacturer Janssen (now known as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine), and used the state-by-state spreadsheets with separate entries for each settling company to create a searchable database.",
      "This year, KFF Health News has updated that database with new data from BrownGreer, including payouts from opioid manufacturers Allergan and Teva, as well as CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart pharmacies.",
      "KFF Health News downloaded data from BrownGreer's website between Jan. 20 and 24, 2025, concerning payouts from all companies. Users can use the database to determine the total dollar amount their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Although this is the most comprehensive data available at a national scale, it provides just a snapshot of all opioid settlement payouts. Other settlements, including with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, are still pending. This data does not reflect additional settlements that some state and local governments have entered into beyond the national deals, such as the agreement between Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio and regional supermarket chain Meijer. As such, this database undercounts the amount of opioid settlement money most places have received and will receive.",
      "Payment details for some states are not available, because those states were not part of national settlement agreements, had unique settlement terms, or opted not to have their payments distributed via BrownGreer. A few examples:",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 West Virginia declined to join several national settlements and instead reached individual settlements with many of these companies.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Texas and Nevada were paid in full by Janssen outside the national settlement, so their payout data reflects payments only from other companies with which they entered national settlements.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Florida, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, among others, opted to receive a lump-sum payment via BrownGreer then distribute the money to localities themselves.",
      "BrownGreer shows that several states received some of their anticipated 2027 payment from the distributors (AmerisourceBergen \u2014 now called Cencora \u2014 Cardinal Health, and McKesson) early in 2024. However, for three states \u2014 Colorado, Michigan, and Washington \u2014 BrownGreer does not provide data on how much of this prepayment went to each locality. As such, locality payments in these states may be undercounted for 2024 and overcounted for 2027.",
      "For Oregon, BrownGreer shows 2024 payments from Walmart as fully paid in its statewide data but lists some August 2024 payments for localities as \"projected.\" Since the data was downloaded well past that August 2024 date, we have included those \"projected\" amounts in the 2024 paid total for Oregon localities. No other states had this discrepancy.",

      "Three litters of dire wolf puppies yielded two males, named Romulus and Remus, and a female, named Khaleesi after the \"Game of Thrones\" character \u2014 a nod to the HBO fantasy drama that featured dire wolves.",
      "However, critics say the physical and genetic resemblance to an extinct species falls short of a full revival.",
      "\"All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else,\" Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research, told the AP.",
      "\"Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can't perform those functions\" in today's environment, Lynch said.",

      "Colossal was also able to create two litters of cloned red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolf in the world.",
      "The company says its de-extinction process could help support conservation efforts globally. \"Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Colossal, Dr. George Church.",
      "In 2021, Colossal announced plans to de-extinct the woolly mammoth \u2014 a concept Church had been developing for years. He told \"60 Minutes\" in 2019, \"I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice, and maybe pigs and elephants. And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade.\"",
      "Last month, the company said its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair \u2014 dubbing its creation\u00a0the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "While the results and images of the the shaggy-haired mice were posted online, Colossal did not publish its research in a peer-reviewed journal and it has not been vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The scientists edited mouse genes related to their hair and fat metabolism \u2014 two qualities woolly mammoths needed to survive in their Arctic habitat. After confirming the gene modification process works in mice, they planned on testing it with elephants, which are woolly mammoth's closest living relatives. But, since Asian elephants are endangered, the company will face a number of additional hurdles. It is also doing work aimed at protecting the world's\u00a0elephant populations.",

    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "summary": "The craft carrying astronaut Jonny Kim and two Russian cosmonauts docked with the space station. They're scheduled for an eight-month stay.",
    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

      "The next total solar eclipse with a path of totality visible from the continental U.S. is still about two decades away.",
      "Millions of Americans witnessed a total solar eclipse chart its way across the United States in 2024. Viewers in\u00a0the path of totality\u00a0saw the moon completely block the sun.",
      "The awe-inspiring experience won't happen in the U.S. again until 2044, with only three states in the path, and 2045, with more than a dozen states in the path.",
      "\"A total solar eclipse is one of the most spectacular things anyone can see in their lifetime,\" Virginia Tech astrophysicist Nahum Arav told CBS News. The eclipse \"looks like a black hole in the sky,\" said Arav, who watched the paths of totality of eclipses in 1991 and 2017.",
      "The 2024 eclipse started on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and then moved into Texas. The eclipse's visibility tracked\u00a0through 15 states\u00a0\u2014 Oklahoma, Illinois, Ohio,\u00a0Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont,\u00a0New Hampshire\u00a0and Maine, among them \u2014 before heading northward into Canada and then exiting North America.",
      "Even with spotty weather in some states, millions of people from coast to coast saw a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon partially covers the sun. However, only those within the path of totality experienced the darkness of the total solar eclipse.",
      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",
      "This next eclipse will mainly be observed in Canada, Arav said.",
      "Path of totality for the 2044 total solar eclipse",
      "The 2044 eclipse will start in Greenland on Aug. 23, 2044, and will continue its path through Canada.",
      "The total solar eclipse will be short, mostly appearing in Canada. It will be visible from just three states in the U.S.: Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",
      "There will be numerous U.S. cities where eclipse watchers can view the total eclipse, including Reno, Nevada; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Orlando, Florida.",
      "Future solar eclipses in North America after 2045",
      "In addition to the 2017 and 2024 total solar eclipses, scientists have predicted six more will appear in the contiguous states  in the 21st century.",

    "summary": "SpaceX's third all-civilian privately chartered flight was the first to carry a crew into polar orbit.",
    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",

      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on Monday, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier Wednesday it would\u00a0raise tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",

      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",

      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to halt lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firings of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board while a legal challenge to the removals plays out.",
      "In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court orders reinstating Cathy Harris to her role on the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the removals unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",
      "The bid for the Supreme Court's intervention comes as the justices have been faced with a flurry of requests for emergency relief from the Trump administration. More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that Mr. Trump's firings of them were unlawful. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "Both agencies, he said, exercise \"substantial\" executive power in executing laws governing the workforce or labor relations.",

    "story": [
      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

    "story": [
      "South Carolina is set to execute another death row inmate by firing squad, a little more than a month after a convicted murderer was executed the same way.",
      "The March 7 execution of Brad Sigmon marked the first execution by firing squad since 2010. Before Sigmon, only three people i the U.S. had been executed by firing squad since the 1970s.",
      "Mikal Mahdi is set to be executed on Friday, April 11. He chose firing squad over lethal injection or electrocution, just as Sigmon did.",
      "Mahdi, 41, was convicted of the 2004 death of Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers. Authorities said that Mahdi had killed a store clerk in North Carolina and stole a vehicle at gunpoint in Columbia when he hid in Myers' shed at his Calhoun County farm after he couldn't buy gas for the stolen car.",
      "Myers was shot eight or nine times. His wife found his burned body in the shed, which had been the backdrop for their wedding 15 months earlier. Mahdi was arrested several days later in Myers' unmarked police truck in Florida.",
      "Mahdi also pleaded guilty to shooting Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk Christopher Boggs twice in the head three days before Myers was killed. He was sentenced to life in prison for Boggs' death.",
      "South Carolina's highest court rejected Mahdi's last major appeal earlier this week. Mahdi's lawyers argued that his original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life and failed to call on relatives and others who knew him in his sentencing defense, but the state Supreme Court ruled that many of those arguments had been made in earlier, also unsuccessful appeals.",
      "South Carolina is legally required to keep some protocols for the execution method secret, but Sigmon's death last month reveals a few key details. Here's what to know about how the execution will go.",
      "Mahdi will wear black, have a target on his chest",
      "The execution process will begin just before 6 p.m. Friday, when the prison warden calls Governor Henry McMaster and asks if he is granting clemency. The warden will also ask the Attorney General's Office if there are any legal blocks to the execution.",
      "If both answers are no, Mahdi will enter the death chamber at the Broad River Correctional Institute in Columbia, South Carolina, the same prison where Sigmon was put to death. He will likely wear black jogging pants and a T-shirt, as Sigmon did, instead of the green prison jumpsuits usually worn by death row inmates. There will be a target with a red bull's-eye on his chest.",
      "Mahdi will then be secured to a chair, with straps around his waist, ankles and arms. Then a curtain to the witness room will open. The right side of Mahdi's face and body will be toward the window.",
      "Mahdi's lawyer or a prison official can read a final statement, if he wishes. A hood will then be placed on his head by a prison employee, who will then walk across the room and open a black pull shade covering the rectangular window where three volunteer shooters are waiting.",
      "All three volunteers are prison employees. Not much is known about them. Prison officials said they have \"completed all required training.\" A shield law passed in 2023, in part to keep the name of any supplier of lethal injection drugs secret, also keeps secret many details about the firing squad, including the names of anyone on the execution team and what specific training they received.",
      "The three volunteers will hold rifles about 15 feet from Mahdi. There won't be any kind of countdown before the three open fire. Shortly afterwards, a doctor with a stethescope will come out to confirm Mahdi is dead. Witnesses will sign an official document stating they saw the execution, then leave.",
      "Specialty bullets designed to destroy the heart",
      "While few details about the volunteer shooters have been made public, a few details about firing squad protocols came out in 2022 during an unrelated trial that ultimately led the state Supreme Court to rule the firing squad, electric chair and lethal injection were all legal and didn't violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The state will use .308-caliber Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often found in police rifles, said Colie Rushton, the director of Security and Emergency Operations at the Corrections Department.",
      "The round is designed to break apart as soon as it hits something firm, in this case the prisoner's rib cage. Fragments will spread out, and the intent is to destroy as much of the heart as possible.",
      "A medical expert for the state said at the 2022 trial that if the heart is heavily damaged an inmate would lose consciousness almost immediately and likely not feel pain. The doctor said survivors of gunshots often report first feeling like they were punched and pain only following a few seconds later.",
      "But a doctor testifying for inmates said it could take longer for an inmate to lose consciousness. He said that, anyone who has broken a rib knows, breathing becomes extremely painful once the bones in the chest are cracked.",
      "If the aim of the executioners is not true, death could take even longer. Damaged hearts can continue to pump blood.",
      "The information released by the state to the public gives no indication what might happen if an inmate survives the initial shots. At the 2022 trial, a doctor testifying on behalf of inmates said his review of protocols indicated the squad could fire again.",
      "\"There was no sound\"",
      "Jeffrey Collins, one of three media witnesses for the firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon, detailed his experience in an essay\u00a0published by the Associated Press. He described many of the details listed above, including Sigmon's black clothing and the lack of warning for witnesses before the shots were fired.",
      "\"There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me,\" Collins wrote. \"And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.\"",
      "Collins described the site of the impact as a \"jagged red spot about the size of the small fist.\"",
      "\"His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound,\" Collins continued. Sigmon was declared dead about two minutes later, he said.",

In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",

      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill in recent days, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",

    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At Veterinary Emergency Group (VEG), this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG's most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer VEG hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",

    "summary": "President Trump is trying to break through Republican opposition that's threatening a budget resolution key to extending his tax cuts and agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is trying to break through Republican opposition that's threatening a budget plan that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, he told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version.\u00a0The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, with a possible floor vote later in the day, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "The dynamic comes as the congressional leaders have pushed to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution the House is now considering. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process, and didn't say how he'd vote.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",
      "\"I will not vote for this bill,\" Roy said. \"Because it is not responsible.\"",

    "summary": "Asa Ellerup has come under public scrutiny following her husband's arrest for three of the Gilgo Beach murders, but the daughters of notorious serial killers BTK and the Happy Face Killer have come to her defense.",
    "story": [
      "When Rex Heuermann was charged in July 2023 for the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Lynn Costello, authorities announced he was also the prime suspect in the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Finally, investigators believed they had caught the elusive murderer of the \"Gilgo Four\" \u2014 the women discovered buried near Long Island's Gilgo Beach in 2010 and long suspected to be the victims of a serial killer.",
      "After his arrest, Heuermann's quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park, Long Island, was overrun by investigators and media, which focused intense scrutiny on his ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann; and his wife of more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "\"Their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of suspected serial killer,\" said Bob Macedonio, Ellerup's attorney.",
      "Macedonio, as well as co-workers of the suspect and the victims' families and friends, spoke to \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty, who has reported on the case since the beginning. An encore of her latest report, \"The Gilgo Beach Serial Killings,\"\u00a0airs Saturday, April 12, 2025 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Macedonio began representing Ellerup shortly after Heuermann's arrest, when she filed for divorce. He says Ellerup was as stunned as anyone by the accusations against her estranged husband.",
      "\"She had no idea any of this was going on,\" said Macedonio of the accusations against Heuermann. \"Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.\"",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on Heuermann. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney says investigators found strands of female hair on two of the victims that they believe could belong to Ellerup.",
      "\"One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent,\" said Tierney. \"And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.\"",
      "Investigators have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred. Tierney says that her hair may have simply gotten on the victims thanks to transfer.",
      "\"You live at home with a spouse, little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's,\" said Tierney. \"Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.\"",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders. When asked if he believed she might be involved in any way, Tierney said there is \"no evidence to indicate that.\"",
      "While Ellerup has received public scrutiny, she has also found sympathy \u2014including from Muriel Henriquez, a former co-worker of Rex Heuermann's at the architectural firm he owned called RH Consulting & Associates.",
      "Henriquez spoke to \"48 Hours\" exclusively and says that Heuermann gave her a sweater in 2007 that Ellerup had picked up while she was on a trip to her native Iceland. Henriquez wonders if Ellerup's trip out of the country might have given Heuermann the opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who disappeared that same summer. Henriquez has held onto the sweater and says it is a reminder of two women she believes are victims.",
      "\"Because the wife's a victim as well,\" said Henriquez. \"For him to ask her to bring back gifts for his employees, and then he's also \u2026 betraying her.\"",
      "Ellerup has also found support from those who perhaps know all too well what she might be going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\" Another person who has spoken out is Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jesperson, a serial killer known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" who taunted authorities with letters signed with a happy face.",
      "\"Today I have an opportunity to use my voice to help Asa,\" Moore said in a TikTok video she posted.",
      "Moore set up a GoFundMe page for Ellerup, which has raised over $50,000. It is money Ellerup's attorney says will largely go to medical bills, since she is battling breast and skin cancer. He says that because Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "\"Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received,\" Macedonio said in a news conference announcing the GoFundMe page. \"She is going through a very difficult time.\"",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Victoria Heuermann, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and Christopher Sheridan are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she is also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "\"She has no one else to turn to at this time,\" said Macedonio. \"Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention.\"",
      "For the moment, Ellerup and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged when police searched it shortly after Heuermann's arrest. It is a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes Rex Heuermann is charged with, as well as of the investigation that continues.",
      "\"We're going to prepare the 'Gilgo Four' case for trial,\" said Tierney. \"And we are going to expand our investigation.",
      "On Jan. 16, 2024, six months after his arrest, Rex Heuermann was charged with the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.",
      "Since then, Heuermann has been charged with the 1993 murder of Sandra Costilla and the 2003 murder of Jessica Taylor and the 2000 murder of Valerie Mack.",

      "Dave\u00a0Schaller: He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.",
      "Police back then knew the client was using a burner phone. That's a prepaid phone that anyone can buy and use anonymously. And they knew that Maureen, Melissa and Megan had all been in contact with burner numbers right before they disappeared.",
      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, they determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park. They called it \"the box.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: So how large an area is that box?",
      "Ray Tierney: It's, you know, a couple of blocks within \u2014 within Massapequa Park.",
      "The new task force began the search for a large-built man who also lived in that small area and owned a Chevy Avalanche at the time of the disappearances.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was there a \"aha!\" moment when, all of a sudden, his name came up?",
      "Rodney Harrison: Once we were able to attach the \u2026 Avalanche inside of that Massapequa box, which then attached to Rex Heuermann, that was a moment where we said, OK, there's something here.",
      "The task force now had a prime suspect. And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they found that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact a victim in Massapequa Park or in midtown Manhattan.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): it was always consistent.",

And prosecutors say that Heuermann was using a burner phone to send these selfies to \"solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\"",
      "One of those accounts linked to Heuermann, prosecutors wrote, was used to conduct \"thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography.\"",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): There was a lot of torture, porn, and \u2026 depictions of women, being abused, being raped, and being killed.",
      "Investigators also say that while they were busy watching Heuermann, Heuermann was trying to watch them \u2014 conducting searches on the task force and the Gilgo victims.",

      "The circumstantial evidence was building, but investigators also had physical evidence from the Gilgo Four\u2014including one male hair that was found in the burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" Megan Waterman's body. They wanted to see if they could link it to Heuermann.",

      "Ray Tierney: That was a remarkable day. It was, you know, the weekend and, you know, you read, you get the report and you read it and then you read it again, and then you read it a third time and then you read it a fourth time, and then you start making calls.",
      "With the DNA, the search histories and the burner phone evidence, the team felt it was time.",

      "Plainclothes officers arrested him around the corner from his office.",
      "Rodney Harrison: I don't think he had any clue. I don't think he had any clue that we were onto him.",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's home, pulling those guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. They say it will take some time to comb through what they have now, and they were tight lipped about what they found.",

      "RODNEY HARRISON: Great question and the answer's yes.",
      "REPORTER 2: \u2026 Can you elaborate on fruitful? You said yes, it's fruitful.",

      "And one more big piece of evidence taken into possession: a first-generation Chevy Avalanche Heuermann once used. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): We were able to seize that Chevy Avalanche pursuant to a search warrant. And we're certainly going to analyze that.",

      "THE FAMILY OF A SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER",
      "After Rex Heuermann's arrest, his quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park was overrun by investigators and media, focusing intense scrutiny on the ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann, and his wife more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "Bob Macedonio: So, their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of (a) suspected serial killer. That's what it's gonna be from now on.",
      "Attorney Bob Macedonio represents Ellerup, who has since filed for divorce from Heuermann. He says she was as stunned as anyone by the accusations.",
      "Bob Macedonio: She had no idea any of this was going on \u2026 The allegations are shocking. Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on her husband. Investigators say they've identified strands of female hair that were found on two of the victims.",
      "D.A. Ray Tierney | Suffolk County: One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent. And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.",
      "Although prosecutors have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred, they will have to explain how those hairs got on the victims. Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney says it could be as simple as transfer.",
      "Ray Tierney: You live at home with a spouse a little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's. Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You don't believe that Rex Heuermann's wife was involved in this in any way?",
      "Ray Tierney: There's no evidence to indicate that. No.",
      "Along with the public scrutiny of Ellerup, there has also been support from people that perhaps know all too well what she's going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\"",
      "MELISSA MOORE (at news conference): I can tell that they are going through hell.",
      "And from Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jesperson \u2014 a serial killer known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" for taunting authorities with letters signed with a happy face.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): She reached out immediately to myself and we put her in contact with Asa.",
      "At a news conference, Macedonio announced Moore set up a GoFundMe page for Ellerup, which raised over $50,000. It is money he says will largely go to medical bills \u2014 Asa is battling breast and skin cancer. And because Rex Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, Macedonio says she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received. Um, she is going through a very difficult time.",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Her daughter, Victoria, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and her son, Christopher, are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she's also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How is she getting through every day?",
      "Bob Macedonio: Honestly?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Yeah.",
      "Bob Macedonio: Minute by minute. \u2026 She has no one else to turn into at this time. \u2026 Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention. She gets followed wherever she goes.",
      "For the moment, she and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged during the police search. It's a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes her estranged husband is charged with and the investigation that continues into what else he may have done.",
      "THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY?",
      "Rex Heuermann, awaiting trial, is locked inside a Suffolk County jail in a 60-square-foot cell. He denies killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello \u2014 their voices now silent as the sand where they had been ruthlessly discarded.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How sure are you as you're sitting here now that Rex Heuermann is the Long Island serial killer?",
      "Ray Tierney: So, we're just at the beginning stage of this case \u2026 but we would not have brought this indictment if we weren't confident in our case.",
      "Rodney Harrison: He took away somebody's mother, somebody's daughter, somebody's sister \u2014 not just one person, multiple individuals.",
      "Heuermann is currently the prime suspect for the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.",
      "And for investigators, an obvious question still hangs heavy: if Heuermann is a killer, are there other victims?",
      "Erin Moriarty: I mean, isn't there a real concern that there may be other victims out there?",
      "Ray Tierney: Always.",
      "Rodney Harrison: Who's to say there's not more bodies out there that we need to investigate?",
      "In 2011, police did find other bodies along Ocean Parkway after finding the Gilgo Four.",

And while \"48 Hours\" cannot substantiate her story, Brass claims she can't shake her memory of the night she says she was solicited for sex by Rex Heuermann, and says she fled the restaurant where they met.",
      "Nikkie Brass: I had never gone anywhere and like felt, fear. My gut was telling me I needed to get away and I never had that before.",
      "Brass says what she found most disturbing is that Heuermann himself brought up those bodies bound in burlap by Gilgo Beach.",

And I said, like, I've never been over there. \u2026 I've never even seen Gilgo Beach. \u2026 And his response was, well, it's really dark and desolate.",

      "Rodney Harrison: It's an unfortunate incident, but right now we believe that she just ran into the marsh and unfortunately drowned.",
      "A former investigator told us that he believes Shannan was high on drugs that night and says her death was an accident \u2014 something John Ray just can't believe. While he doesn't think Shannan was a victim of Heuermann, he does believe she was murdered and points to that 911 call.",

      "While questions remain about Shannan's last hours, there's no question she's the reason so many families may finally be getting answers they have long waited for. \"48 Hours\" spoke to her sister, Sherre Gilbert, in 2011.",

    "summary": "The IRS has agreed to share immigrants' tax data with ICE for to help authorities identify and deport undocumented immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service is expected to resign after the agency disclosed that it has agreed to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify and deport undocumented immigrants.",
      "According to a source familiar with the situation and a statement from the Treasury Department, Melanie Krause is leaving the agency due to disagreement over the Treasury Department's decision to share IRS taxpayer data with the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Melanie Krause has been leading the IRS through a time of extraordinary change. As we focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer, we are also in the midst of breaking down data silos that for too long have stood in the way of identifying waste, fraud, and abuse and bringing criminals to justice,\" a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Krause is planning to resign after opting into the agency's recently offered Deferred Resignation Program, the source told CBS News on Tuesday. The Washington Post was the first to report on her resignation.",
      "Krause could leave as soon as April 28.",
      "Kathleen Walters, the IRS chief privacy officer, Teresa Hunter, IRS chief financial officer, and Mike Wetklow, IRS chief risk officer, are also leaving the agency, two sources familiar with the situation said. Walters' departure is through the Deferred Resignation Program as well and is related to the Department of Homeland Security-data sharing agreement, one source said.",
      "Late Monday, the IRS disclosed its memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security in a court filing in a lawsuit filed by Public Citizen, which seeks to bar the Treasury Department from disclosing tax return information to immigration enforcement authorities.",
      "According to the exhibit, the IRS will review all requests and account for disclosures made under the memorandum. While some of the memo is highly redacted, it reveals that the IRS will disclose to ICE the names and addresses of immigrants, among other information.",
      "The new data-sharing arrangement will allow ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally with their IRS tax records.",
      "Treasury argues that the agreement will help carry out President Trump's agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Advocates say the IRS-DHS information sharing agreement violates longstanding privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the agency's thinking on the agreement said the basis for the agreement is founded in \"longstanding authorities granted by Congress, which serve to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals.\"",
      "Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, told reporters at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix on Tuesday that the agreement would help ICE find people who are collecting benefits they aren't entitled to and are \"kind of hiding in plain sight\" using someone else's identity.",
      "Working with Treasury and other departments is \"strictly for the major criminal cases,\" Lyons said.",
      "The IRS has already been called upon once to help with immigration enforcement earlier this year.",
      "Noem in February sent a request to Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS' boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back.",
      "Tax law experts for the NYU Tax Law Center wrote Monday that the agreement \"threatens to violate the rights that many more Americans have under longstanding laws that protect their tax information from wrongful disclosure or dissemination.\"",
      "\"In fact, it is difficult to see how the IRS could release information to DHS while complying with taxpayer privacy statutes,\" they said, \"IRS officials who sign off on data sharing under these circumstances risk breaking the law, which could result in criminal and civil sanctions.\"",
      "The memo states that the IRS and ICE \"will perform their duties in a manner that recognizes and enhances individuals' right of privacy and will ensure their activities are consistent with laws, regulations, and good administrative practices.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 07:28:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Lawyers for the women say their litigation has resulted in one of the largest cumulative awards against a single individual in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Starting in the 1980s, New York law enforcement and health officials fielded sexual abuse complaints from the young patients of a respected pediatrician who ran his practice out of a basement office in his home on Long Island.",
      "But Stuart Copperman was never charged with any crime, and it was only as he approached retirement in 2000, at the age of 65, that he was stripped of his medical license over the complaints.",
      "Now, 25 years later, more than 100 of his former patients have some vindication in their yearslong fight: a court has ordered him to pay a total of $1.6 billion.",
      "The Rev. Debbi Rhodes, who was awarded $25 million, says the completion of the litigation in late March in state Supreme Court brought a mix of relief and frustration.",
      "\"I'm not sure if he's facing justice. He kind of got away with it for all these years,\" the 63-year-old Episcopal priest in Las Vegas said by phone. \"But to have a court say, definitively, 'I believe you.' To hear that -- that's heavy medicine right there.\"",
      "A Manhattan lawyer who has represented Copperman over the years didn't respond to multiple messages seeking comment in recent days.",
      "Copperman has steadfastly denied the allegations, suggesting he was simply being \"thorough\" in his examinations, which his former patients say were typically conducted after he had ushered their parents out of the room.",
      "A lengthy history of complaints",
      "Some of the women filed complaints with local police and medical boards over the years, but no criminal charges or disciplinary actions were ever imposed, according to Rhodes' lawsuit and others. Then a state medical board revoked his license after hearing from six accusers.",
      "Statute of limitations laws, however, prevented Copperman's accusers from filing lawsuits until passage of New York's Child Victims Act, a 2019 law that temporarily allowed people to file suits over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.",
      "The Catholic Church and other major institutions have reached huge settlements to resolve sexual misconduct claims, but lawyers for the women say their litigation has resulted in one of the largest cumulative awards against a single individual in the U.S.",
      "\"For decades, these women were silenced and dismissed,\" said Kristen Gibbons Feden, a Philadelphia lawyer representing the women. \"Now, they cannot be ignored.\"",
      "Copperman never responded to the litigation",
      "The Long Island court ruled for the women because Copperman never responded to the litigation. But some of the special referees, in assessing damages, said they believed the women.",
      "\"The psychological scars from the abuse suffered by Plaintiff are profound and permanent,\" wrote William Bodkin in awarding $27 million to a woman identified as \"Jane Doe T.A.\" in April 2024.",
      "\"Here, there can only be outrage at Copperman's reprehensible conduct,\" he wrote in Rhodes' $25 million judgment in December 2024.",
      "The last of the 104 awards were handed down March 28, with amounts ranging from $500,000 to $32 million, according to Michael Della, a Long Island-based attorney also representing the women.",
      "The women also sued local hospitals and health care networks, but those claims were dismissed.",
      "\"Nobody can grow if they are living in shame\"",
      "Like many of the accusers, Rhodes says Copperman sexually abused her during routine visits at his home office in Merrick, some 35 miles east of Manhattan. She says the abuse started in 1968 when she was 7 years old, and led to an eating disorder and alcohol and drug problems at an early age.",
      "Rhodes says she speaks openly and often about her childhood trauma as part of her ministry, which includes working with prison inmates. She still wrestles with anxiety, depression and other mental health impacts.",
      "\"Nobody can grow if they are living in shame. Nobody can really change,\" said Rhodes, who has two now-grown children and whose husband is also an Episcopal priest. \"I'm not even sure you can love if you're living in shame.\"",
      "The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Rhodes has.",
      "Another woman who was awarded $27 million but declined to be named said revisiting childhood trauma during her deposition was painful but, in a way, healing.",
      "\"It feels good to know that someone heard us,\" the woman, identified in the litigation as \"Jane Doe A.W.,\" said in a phone interview. \"People now understand the magnitude of what he did.\"",
      "Lawyers for the women say they have retained a collections specialist to begin pursuing compensation from Copperman.",
      "But Rhodes and other plaintiffs say they've accepted the possibility they may never see much, if any. Copperman is now 89 years old and lives in South Florida.",
      "\"I'm not sure what justice looks like even if I got a million dollars tomorrow,\" Rhodes said. \"For me, it's about saying to other women who are facing this that someone will listen to you. I wasn't believed for a very long time. Don't stay silent. Speak your truth.\"",

      "In a filing Monday, the government said that in August, \"Routh sought to purchase the devices online from an associate Routh believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons.\"",
      "Routh allegedly told an associate to \"'send me an rpg [rocket propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'\" according to the court document.",
      "\"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh told his associate.",
      "The government said Routh also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle the same month, and this rifle would have been an even more destructive and powerful version of the one he had already allegedly obtained. Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024. A member of Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail spotted his rifle in the tree line and opened fire at the suspect, who didn't fire back. He fled by car, and Routh was detained about 50 miles north of the golf course.",
      "According to the Secret Service, Routh did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was playing a few holes away from where Routh was allegedly located.",

    "story": [
      "Measles is still making headlines in 2025, prompting questions about the life-threatening disease and how to prevent it. Here's what to know as the U.S. grapples with its biggest measles outbreak in years.",
      "Measles outbreak",
      "The largest measles outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, where health officials have confirmed more than 500 cases since late January. State and local health officials say the Texas outbreak is primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status.",
      "In late February, a child died of measles after being hospitalized in that outbreak. State and local health officials said the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child. A second child, an 8-year-old girl who was also unvaccinated, died from measles in early April.",
      "Measles cases have also been reported in more than 20 other states.",
      "An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico tested positive for\u00a0measles\u00a0after their death, health officials announced in March, but said\u00a0the official cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "How deadly is measles?",
      "Without vaccination, measles\u00a0can be dangerous or even deadly. While most people's symptoms improve, 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who catch measles will be hospitalized, 1 out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to\u00a03 of every 1,000 will die.",
      "The measles virus is airborne and extremely contagious. Before the first measles vaccine became available in the 1960s, almost everyone would catch it at some point during childhood, and between 400 and 500 Americans \u2014 mostly children \u2014\u00a0died every year from measles.",
      "Measles symptoms",
      "Symptoms typically begin about seven to 14 days after a person is exposed to the measles virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that the initial symptoms may appear similar to those of many other common viral illnesses, including:",
      "FeverCoughRunny noseRed eyes",
      "Fever",
      "Cough",
      "Runny nose",
      "Red eyes",
      "Another characteristic sign is a rash that begins to develop a few days later. A patient's fever may spike to 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, the CDC says.",
      "In some cases, serious complications can develop, including pneumonia or encephalitis, a swelling of the brain. Encephalitis may lead to convulsions and can cause deafness or leave a child with a lifelong intellectual disability, health officials warn.",
      "As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, which the CDC says is the most common cause of death from measles in young children.",
      "\"The predominant issues that we talk about, and that have led patients to be admitted to the hospital, are those respiratory issues, and so that is a frequent cause of death,\" Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, said at a news conference on Feb. 26. At the time, she said, the hospital had seen about 20 patients admitted with confirmed measles cases, including several who needed intensive care.",
      "\"There are also neurological issues that can happen acutely \u2014 encephalitis, swelling of the brain, blindness, other issues along that line that can also be a part of acute measles,\" Johnson said.",
      "She added, \"There are lots of childhood rashes and fevers, and as parents, we all know that our kids get these here and there. This is not that. This is a much more serious illness that has much greater risk of serious complications.\"",
      "Measles rash",
      "Several days after the first symptoms begin, characteristic tiny white spots develop inside the mouth, and a facial rash spreads to the rest of the body.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, described the rash as a \"flat, blotchy red rash.\"",
      "Measles immune amnesia",
      "Measles can also impact someone's immunity long after the infection is gone in a process called \"immune amnesia,\" which can last months to a couple of years.",
      "The virus can damage the immune system, Gounder recently explained, raising the risk of other infections even after the person has recovered.",
      "\"Measles infects immune cells, and when it does so, it damages immune cells and it partially wipes out your immune system's memory to certain infections, so that leaves you more susceptible to getting some of those infections,\" she said. \"The best thing is not to get measles in the first place, and the best way to do that is to get vaccinated.\"",
      "Why is there a measles outbreak?",
      "With\u00a0safe, effective vaccines\u00a0available, experts are pointing to lower vaccination rates as a reason why we're seeing these increasing cases. Health officials confirmed that nearly all of the patients in the Texas outbreak were not vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.",
      "\"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins, recently\u00a0told CBS News. \"What we're seeing is, one of the places in Texas \u2014 it has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination \u2014 having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "While measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, doctors and public health officials say the vaccine is safe and highly effective. It is normally given in two doses as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been used for decades.",
      "But nationwide, at least 10 states have seen childhood vaccination rates\u00a0decline, jeopardizing communities'\u00a0herd immunity\u00a0from widespread outbreaks.",
      "Like Texas, some Florida schools \u2014 such as an elementary school in Broward County last year \u2014 have\u00a0seen measles outbreaks. The vaccination rate for Florida kindergartners has fallen to 88.1%, according to the CDC, the lowest in decades.",
      "As concerns grew about the latest outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history as a\u00a0vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy said in\u00a0an interview with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook on April 8.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",
      "RFK Jr., measles and Vitamin A",
      "Kennedy has previously shared some misleading information about the potential role of vitamins in measles treatment and prevention.",
      "In some studies, Vitamin A has been shown to reduce the severity of measles and the risk of death from the virus \u2014 but these studies were among highly malnourished populations in low-income countries. Research shows Vitamin A supplements are\u00a0not a substitute for measles vaccination, even among severely malnourished groups.",
      "\"Vitamin A reduces the risk of some complications among severely malnourished kids who have Vitamin A deficiency. It does not prevent measles or the damage the infection does to the immune system,\" Gounder said. \"Vitamin A is not a substitute for measles vaccination.\"",

      "When do you get the measles vaccine?",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0recommends children get vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, with their first dose between the ages of 12 to 15 months.",
      "\"That's after the antibodies you get from your mom, through the placenta and through breast milk, have faded away, so that the vaccine will actually work \u2014 so there's a logic to when we vaccinate,\" Gounder explained.",
      "Then the second dose is recommended at about 4 to 6 years of age.",
      "One dose is 93% effective against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective,\u00a0research shows. The vaccine also protects against\u00a0mumps and\u00a0rubella, also known as German measles, which are caused by different viruses.",
      "Studies have also shown\u00a0that the MMR vaccine, which was first introduced in 1971, may be given safely and effectively in combination with other vaccines.",
      "But according to recent\u00a0KFF polling, about 17% of parents say they have skipped or delayed a vaccine dose for their children.",
      "\"This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,\" Gounder said.",
      "How long does the measles vaccine last?",
      "For most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life, Gounder said.",
      "\"If somebody is fully vaccinated against measles and has a normal immune system, they don't need to worry about measles,\" said Adalja. \"You're not going to be at risk for contracting measles because the vaccine is very, very effective.\"",
      "Who should get a measles booster?",
      "While most people have protection that lasts for life after getting vaccinated in early childhood, people born after 1957 but vaccinated before 1968 should consider a booster shot, Gounder said.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" she said.",
      "There are also other people who could potentially benefit from getting a booster, she added, including those working in health care, overseas or in places where there is an active measles outbreak.",
      "If you're unsure if or when you were vaccinated against the measles, start by tracking down your vaccination records if possible, Gounder advised. But, if you can't find those records, there is \"no harm in getting an extra dose,\" she said, adding that no blood test confirmation is needed.",
      "\"That's actually what we would advise to do, as opposed to getting a blood test to see if there are antibodies \u2014 just get a booster if you're in doubt,\" she said.",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation on March 14 invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants who are allegedly members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority, but clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",
      "The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.",

      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation. Top White House officials had argued migrants subject to deportation under the law are not entitled to due process. But, the Supreme Court said on April 7 that going forward, Alien Enemies Act detainees must receive notice \"that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" and the notice must allow them to challenge their detention.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives.

      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

      "The three Americans convicted for participating in a botched coup attempt in Congo last year have been repatriated to the United States, days after their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, Congo's presidency said Tuesday.",
      "The three will serve their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama said on X.",
      "Federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint in the District of Utah Wednesday, charging all three defendants \u2014 Marcel Malanga, 22; Tyler Thompson, 22; and Benjamin Zalman-Polun, 37 \u2014 and a fourth man, Joseph Peter Moesser, 67, with multiple charges connected to conspiring to unlawfully carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Malanga, Thompson and Zalman-Polun will make their initial court appearances in federal court in Brooklyn, the Department of Justice said in a statement. Further legal proceedings are set to take place in Salt Lake City, Utah. Moesser is expected to appear on April 10 at the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City.",
      "The State Department said it was aware of their transfer into U.S. custody and referred questions to the Justice Department.",
      "\"They're in our custody and we also strongly condemn the armed attacks of May 19 and support the DRC authorities in holding those responsible appropriately accountable,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a news briefing Tuesday. \"At the same time, we seek consistent, compassionate, humane treatment and a fair legal process on behalf of those U.S. citizens.\"",
      "Malanga is the son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the foiled coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who live-streamed from the palace during the attempt, was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said.",
      "Malanga, who had declared himself \"President of New Zaire,\" was a rich businessman and former captain in the Congolese army. He stood for elections in 2011 but was arrested and detained for several weeks. Marcel Malanga has said his father forced him to take part in the botched coup attempt that left six people dead.",
      "Also repatriated were Thompson, a friend of the younger Malanga who flew to Africa from Utah for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Zalman-Polun, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.",
      "The news of their repatriation brought joy to families. Thompson's stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told the AP they didn't have all the details on the return, \"but we're so excited to have him on American soil again.\"",
      "The pardon and repatriation came amid efforts by Congolese authorities to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. in exchange for security support that will help Kinshasa fight rebels in the country's conflict-hit east.",
      "The release of the U.S. citizens comes a week after the Department of State announced it appointed Massad Boulos\u00a0as senior adviser for Africa. Boulos traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on April 3 and met with the government officials and business leaders \"to advance efforts for durable peace\" and to \"promote U.S. private sector investment in the region,\" according to Bruce's office.",

      "Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. But on Wednesday afternoon the president announced he is pausing most of the new import taxes for 90 days and lowering the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately,",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump said he's increasing the tariff on Chinese imports to 125%.",

In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",

Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",

      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

    "story": [
      "It was another wild ride on Wall Street, with stocks swinging sharply Monday as economists raised the specter of a U.S. recession and President Trump threatened to escalate U.S. tariffs against China.",
      "Leading indexes fell sharply in the morning, briefly rebounded on a false report that President Trump was considering a 90-day tariff freeze for all countries except China, then rode the roller-coaster back down in the afternoon.",
      "\"Could things get worse? Of course they could,\" said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. \"We're not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course you're going to have back and forth\" in markets.",

      "Stocks wavered in afternoon trading as Mr. Trump escalated his threats against China, saying on social media that the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products.",
      "Mr. Trump said in the post that \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "Recession concerns",
      "Investors have panned President Trump's tariffs, saying they are likely to hit U.S. economic growth and drive up inflation. Goldman Sachs economists cited the barrage of levies on Monday in raising the odds of a recession to 45%.",
      "\"The combination of larger tariffs, greater policy uncertainty, declining business and consumer confidence, and messaging from the administration indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of its policies increase downside risk,\" Goldman analysts said in a report.",
      "Stocks plummeted last week after Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% global duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries. The new trade measures sent markets into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their biggest two-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses Monday, continuing their skid from last week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% \u2014 its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, while Taiwan's Taiex fell 9.7%, its heaviest loss on record. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 7.8%, the Shanghai Composite index sank 7.3%, South Korea's Kospi dropped 5.6% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 4.2%.",

      "CBS News asked the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem about the incident and Rabee's father's claim that American officials had accepted the Israeli military's explanation of the shooting; the embassy said it had referred the query to the U.S. State Department. A State Department spokesperson offered condolences to the family and said the U.S. was aware of the IDF's statement, but said out of respect for the family's privacy would have no other comment at this time.",
      "Rabee's father said it appeared his son had been shot with two different guns, and that two bullets had entered his heart, two had struck his head, two had hit his shoulders, and then five others had hit his body.",
      "\"It was a field execution,\" Rabee's father said.",
      "Asad Ayub Ahed, the other 14-year-old U.S. national who was shot alongside Rabee and al-Rahman, was still in a hospital in serious condition on Monday.",

The global tariff took effect on Saturday, while the matching tariffs are set to hit on April 9.",
      "The scale of the tariffs has surprised investors, sending U.S. stocks into their sharpest decline in five years and wiping out trillions in investor wealth. Many economists warn that imposing broad tariffs on goods shipped into the U.S. could drive up inflation, chill spending by consumers and hurt economic growth.",
      "Retaliating against the U.S., China said Friday it will place a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. Beijing in March also started charging a 15% tax on American farm products, including chicken, pork and soy beans.",

      "Speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs are \"definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. The president needs to reset global trade.\"",

      "\"Our assumption is that, over the next few months Trump will make 'deals' with many countries, although China may be the exception,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"Once it becomes clear that he is willing to accept relatively minor concessions in exchange for scaling back those tariffs, equities should rebound.\"",

The state of New Jersey needs to step up and take care of this problem. They have the resources, and bussing people in from all over to Toms River is not a safe situation.\"",

But it was like a restaurant where people go, and they pay for their meal, and they feel good that the money's going to be used for something. But this pop-up thing at the library was primarily geared toward making the library, the public library, ground zero for homelessness,\" Rodrick said.",
      "The pop-up restaurant opened on Feb. 11 and is one of a total of four locations in the state. It allows diners to pay it forward and cover a suggested $12 cost for those who can\u2019t afford a meal there.",

We are not here to just move people around or force them into the shadows. Our Foundation has built nearly a thousand\u00a0units of affordable and supportive housing.\"",
      "\"Through our JBJ Soul Kitchen, we connect people to resources and services.\u00a0Whether they need employment, mental health support, or housing, we try to remove the barriers that are keeping them from thriving, not\u00a0just\u00a0surviving.\"",

      "Prior to Bon Jovi's organization, Rodrick told Fox News Digital his concerns began after he took office about a year ago, when he was able to close down two homeless encampments and get individuals into housing. But then the Ocean County Board decided to open a warming center, and according to Rodrick, nonprofits began \"bussing people into town.\"",
      "Rodrick said he raised his concerns to the board, but \"they did it anyway and engaged a nonprofit that has various warming centers across the state and, inevitably, they start bussing people into town. Because if their beds are full in one town, they're incentivized to hang on to these people, and they start putting them in your warming center.\"",
      "\"We wound up with dozens and dozens of people being dropped off downtown every single day at the library no less, where a mom should feel comfortable walking into the library with her daughter and get a book. You shouldn't have to walk through gangs of two dozen intoxicated or mentally ill homeless individuals, and that's the real issue here,\" adding there have been numerous police and EMS calls since March from the library.",
      "He also claims that there is \"a lot of money that chases around this issue.\"",
      "\"One of these nonprofits, he formed a nonprofit, this guy, and within a few short years he's bringing in almost a million dollars in revenue, $750,000 according to charitable organization reports,\" Rodrick said, while declining to call out a specific charity.",

It's a big problem.\"",
      "He continued, \"I feel they're bussing them in to create the appearance of a problem so that the solution will be to open up a shelter, which will not improve the situation. It will drastically worsen the situation because then you'll have people dropping people [off in Toms River] from all over the place. And what do you do with them when you can't keep them? It's a real problem. It's a mental health problem, and it's a substance abuse problem.\"",
      "\"I'm not accusing Jon Bon Jovi of being in this for profit,\" Rodrick noted. \"We all like his music. And I think he means well and what he's doing is the right thing, trying to feed people. We could all agree on that.\"",
      "\"However, bussing dozens of people from all over the state of New Jersey, all over the County of Ocean \u2026 I've had people come in from as far away as North Carolina and Philadelphia that wind up in housing that I have to then provide, hotels and such.

      "\"This study shows that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an effective and safe weight-loss approach.\"",
      "\"TRE involves limiting the daily window of food intake to eight to 10 hours or less on most days of the week \u2013 for example, 16/8 or 14/10 protocols.\"",
      "In the study \u2014 which was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 the participants had a fast day calorie goal that was 80% less than their baseline energy requirements, which equates to about 400 to 600 calories per day for women and 500 to 700 calories for men.",
      "On fast days, participants consumed about 400 to 600 calories per day for women and 500 to 700 calories per day for men. (iStock)",
      "The three fast days could not be back to back, the researchers noted, and on the four \"non-fast\" days, participants could eat what they wanted without counting calories, but were encouraged to make healthy choices.",
      "\"This study shows that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an effective and safe weight-loss approach and can be considered as an option among the many other evidence-based dietary strategies for adults seeking weight loss,\" said Ostendorf.",
      "STUDY REVEALS EXERCISING EVERY DAY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY: \u2018BETTER THAN NONE\u2019",
      "In several other recent trials, different versions of IMF, such as 5:2, have been tested without any significant difference compared to DCR, the study noted.",
      "\"Once we completed our trial, we were actually somewhat surprised to see that our data didn\u2019t align with these prior published studies of IMF versus DCR,\" Ostendorf said.",
      "The study concluded that 4:3 IMF resulted in \"modestly greater weight loss\" among adults who are overweight or obese. (iStock)",
      "The researchers believe that three-day fasting is the \"sweet spot for an IMF paradigm,\" as it\u2019s not too rigid but still effective.",
      "For those interested in trying the 4:3 IMF method, Ostendorf suggests starting with one fasting day \u2014 eating about 500 calories \u2014 and adding the others over time, allowing the body to acclimate.",

      "\"[This] likely played a large role, because it provided participants in both groups with support for the randomized dietary paradigm, including nutrition information, accountability, behavioral change strategies and social support.\"",

      "The study, led by The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in collaboration with researchers across multiple institutes, assessed 100 participants following a long-term keto diet who developed elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (known as the \"bad\" type).",

      "High cholesterol has long gotten a bad rap for causing poor heart health \u2014 but a new study suggests that the low-carb ketogenic diet may not be linked to cardiovascular disease. (iStock)",
      "Using advanced cardiac imaging, the researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with changes in plaque levels in the heart\u2019s arteries or with baseline heart disease over a one-year period.",
      "Instead, existing plaque levels seemed to be a better predictor of future plaque accumulation.",
      "\"This population of people \u2014 metabolically healthy with elevated LDL due to being in ketosis \u2014 are not automatically at increased cardiac risk simply because their LDL is elevated,\" Bret Scher, MD, medical director of Baszucki Group, which provided funding for the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "'I'M A HEART SURGEON AND THIS IS WHAT I COOK FOR DINNER'",
      "\"Therefore, we should likely shift away from LDL and ApoB and toward vascular imaging with CAC or CTA for better risk prediction and informing how or if to treat someone's cardiac risk factors,\" added the California-based doctor.",
      "The study findings were published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances.",
      "Using advanced cardiac imaging, the researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with changes in plaque levels in the heart\u2019s arteries or with baseline heart disease over a one-year period. (iStock)",
      "Previous studies have also shown that people qualifying as LMHR have similar levels of coronary plaque to otherwise comparable groups that have normal LDL levels, \"underscoring that ketogenic diet-induced LDL increases may not indicate a higher risk of coronary plaque,\" the researcher said.",
      "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, noted that this is the first study to isolate very high LDL and ApoB as risk factors for heart disease.",

      "This is the first prospective trial of its kind in a unique population often labeled \u2018high-risk\u2019 by traditional guidelines, one doctor said, raising important questions about how cardiovascular risk is assessed in the context of low-carb, high-fat diets. (iStock)",
      "According to Norwitz, cardiac imaging, including a CAC score, has \"far more value\" than cholesterol levels in predicting plaque progression.",
      "\"Thus, CAC scores can be used to risk-stratify patients and help individualize care,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Scher noted that \"ketogenic therapy\" can be effective in treating certain metabolic-related conditions, but some people are afraid of continuing a keto diet because of their cholesterol.",
      "\"This study provides support that they do not necessarily need to stop the diet or treat their cholesterol \u2014 rather, they can work with their healthcare team for a more individualized and appropriate cardiac workup,\" he advised.",
      "Raising important questions",
      "Dr. Ken Berry, a family physician and\u00a0diabetes specialist in Tennessee, was not involved in the research but shared his thoughts on what he described as a \"groundbreaking\" study.",
      "\"The study found no association between LDL-C, ApoB and progression of coronary plaque over one year using high-resolution CT angiography,\" he said to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Instead, the strongest predictor of plaque progression was pre-existing plaque, not cholesterol levels \u2014 leading researchers to conclude that \u2018plaque begets plaque, ApoB does not.\u2019\"",

      "Potential study limitations",
      "Dr. Bradley Serwer, a cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, a Cincinnati-based company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, reviewed the study and pointed out some potential limitations.",

      "The cardiologist does, however, agree with the authors\u2019 conclusions that \"improved risk stratification tools\" are essential for identifying individuals at higher risk of coronary artery disease.",
      "The effects of a ketogenic diet can be measured using a ketosis meter. \"I hope doctors will embrace this research and treat this specific population of people differently from the rest of their patients, understanding the unique physiologic state of ketosis and the metabolic benefits it provides,\" a researcher said.

      "Former \"MythBusters\" star Adam Savage is exploring the science of longevity, asking how lifestyle choices, stress and even sleep affect how long we live.",
      "Savage, now a YouTube creator and head of the channel Tested, has partnered with health technology company Medtronic to engage in discussions about longevity. While not a researcher himself, he has taken a deep dive into scientific insights from experts and reflected on his own experiences.",
      "\"Longevity has always been a fascination for me,\" Savage told Fox News Digital\u00a0in an exclusive interview.\u00a0\"I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to know how to live better and maybe even longer? But the real question is what actually works?\"",

      "Adam Savage speaks at MegaCon Orlando 2025 at the Orange County Convention Center Feb. 8, 2025, in Orlando, Fla. (Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",
      "He credits his \"MythBusters\" experience with fueling his passion for scientific exploration.",
      "\"Making that show legitimized the practice of science and engineering to me,\" Savage said. \"It made me realize how much of our world can be tested, questioned and improved through experimentation.\"",
      "Through his discussions with people on the street for Medtronic, Savage has uncovered key lifestyle factors affecting longevity. He noted a cultural shift in what we consider to be old age, highlighting that people today consider themselves \"young-ish\" for longer.",
      "Savage also pointed to Blue Zones, regions known for long life expectancy, but questioned whether longevity there stems simply from location or cultural practices.",
      "\"We assume people in these areas live longer because of where they are, but what if it\u2019s really just the way they live? That\u2019s the part that fascinates me,\" he said.\u00a0AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "\"There\u2019s no magic secret. It\u2019s a mix of daily habits \u2014 what you eat, how you move, how you interact with your community, how you handle stress. All those things matter.\"",
      "Savage has taken a personal interest in testing different longevity strategies in his own life. He spoke candidly with Fox News Digital about his journey with intermittent fasting, which helped him lose 25 pounds and eliminate sleep apnea.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy how much of a difference it made,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t just lose weight. I felt sharper, I slept better and I stopped snoring. It was like flipping a switch on my health.\"",
      "He also reflected on his past smoking habits and what it took to quit.",
      "\"I had to admit I wasn\u2019t smoking for enjoyment,\" Savage said. \"I was just doing it out of habit. Once I realized that, it was easy to quit.\"",
      "Medtronic is investigating how science can extend our lives. Savage believes that lifestyle choices and community have been beneficial in his own life. (iStock)",
      "On alcohol, Savage dismissed the idea of a universal approach, arguing that studies conflict. While he personally cut back, he emphasized that people shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about their lifestyle choices.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in not feeling guilty about the things that you do to the core, whether it's smoking, whether it's watching something dumb or puzzling for 100 hours at a time,\" he said. \"I don't care about any of those. We all do these things to sort of bring relaxation and down regulate. I just think that alcohol is an especially poor down regulator in the final analysis.\"",
      "Beyond lifestyle choices, medical advancements are playing an increasingly critical role in extending both lifespan and \"healthspan,\" the years we live without serious disease. Medtronic, which focuses on healthcare technology globally, has developed medical devices designed to manage chronic conditions, improve heart health and advance minimally invasive surgeries.",
      "According to Medtronic, as people live longer, the focus is shifting toward enhancing not just lifespan but quality of life. The company\u2019s latest innovations include artificial intelligence-driven healthcare monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries and advanced pacemakers, all aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Savage also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity.",
      "Medtronic claims the first person to live to 150 may already have been born. When asked if there is an upper limit to human life, Savage replied, \"I think right now 150 is a very realistic target to be shooting for and to be discussing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That's really what science foreshadowing is,\" added Savage. \"It's about asking these questions and seeing, \u2018OK, what numbers are unrealistic.\u2019 I think 40 years ago, 150 would have seemed radically unrealistic. Today it seems more realistic, and I think it's entirely reasonable that, let's say, by 2040, we may all have a different cultural answer to that question.\"",

      "Plaintiffs filed two separate lawsuits asking federal judges in Brownville, Texas, and Orange County, New York, to grant a temporary restraining order blocking their removals under the 1798 wartime immigration law that was reviewed by the Supreme Court just days earlier.",
      "U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., in Brownsville, Texas, granted a temporary restraining order filed on behalf of three Venezuelan nationals. The order temporarily blocks their removal under the AEA, as well as the removal of \"any other person that Respondents claim are subject to removal under the Proclamation\" from the district's El Valle Detention Center, according to the text of his ruling.",
      "Rodriguez, a Trump appointee, sided with plaintiffs' contention that allowing the law to be used for their deportations would likely cause \"immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals,\" whom he said would likely be \"unable to seek habeas relief.\"",

      "In addition, he said, the \"substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\" if deported.",
      "Rodriguez said he will hear from both parties in court again Friday to continue extending the 14-day emergency order.",
      "In the New York case filed in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein \u2014 a Clinton appointee \u2014 sided with two Venezuelan nationals whose attorneys argued they likely wouldn\u2019t have time to seek the habeas relief granted by the Supreme Court in its emergency ruling.",

      "Both clients, \"and others similarly situated to them,\" are now \"all at imminent risk of removal\" by the Trump administration without proper notice, lawyers said in the filing.",
      "Hellerstein\u2019s ruling, unlike that of the federal judge in Texas, stopped short of directly addressing whether the Alien Enemies Act is an appropriate legal basis for deporting the two individuals, though it temporarily blocks the law from being used to remove them.",
      "The updates follow a 5\u20134 Supreme Court ruling on Monday that lifted a lower court\u2019s restraining order, allowing the Trump administration to temporarily resume use of the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 albeit with new due process protections for migrants.",

      "But the proceedings must take place in the federal jurisdictions where detainees are held \u2014 raising concerns among immigration advocates, who note that these cases are often difficult to bring individually and typically occur in court districts where most migrants are detained.",
      "\"Whether or not you're a gang member, the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used under these circumstances,\" lawyers for the ACLU said in an earlier court filing, noting that the Alien Enemies Act \"is a military authority.\"",
      "\"It is not supposed to be used in peacetime against a gang,\" they said.",

      "In granting the temporary restraining order, Rodriguez, the Trump appointee, agreed with the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \"maintaining the status quo is required to afford the parties the ability to develop a fuller record for the Court to consider the request for a preliminary injunction and other forms of relief,\" and to \"prevent the immediate and irreparable injury that may occur with the immediate removal of any Venezuelan alien subject to the Proclamation.\"",
      "\"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the Proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration had urged the court to vacate the lower court ruling, arguing in a Supreme Court filing that the lower court orders \"rebuffed\" their immigration agenda, including their ability \"to protect the Nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations.\"",

      "Earlier this month, reports emerged of a major data breach involving X, after a self-proclaimed data enthusiast known as \"ThinkingOne\" claimed to have released a database containing over 200 million user records on a popular hacker forum. The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user\u2019s X profile.",

      "X app on an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data.

      "7 ways you can stay safe from the X data breach",
      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",

      "2) Use temporary chats: Features like ChatGPT\u2019s Temporary Chat mode prevent conversations from being stored or used for training purposes.",
      "3) Opt out of training data usage: Many AI platforms offer settings to exclude your prompts from being used for model improvement. Explore these options in account settings.",
      "4) Anonymize inputs: Tools like Duck.ai anonymize prompts before sending them to AI models, reducing the risk of identifiable data being stored.",
      "5) Secure your account:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0and use strong passwords for added protection against unauthorized access. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Remember, your account-level details like email addresses and location can be stored and used to train AI models, so securing your account helps limit how much personal information is accessible. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6) Use a VPN:\u00a0Employ a reputable virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt internet traffic and conceal your IP address, enhancing online privacy during chatbot use. A VPN adds a crucial layer of anonymity, especially since data shared with AI tools can include sensitive or identifying information, even unintentionally. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Ultimately, it\u2019s up to you to strike a balance between leveraging AI\u2019s capabilities and safeguarding your personal information.

    "summary": "Double-clicking is something we all do, often without giving it a second thought. But it could be giving hackers permission to do something dangerous.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains step-by-step how to protect your Smart TV from hackers.",
      "Nowadays, double-clicking on something on a website without thinking can set you up for hackers to reach your information.",
      "A new hacking trick called \"doubleclickjacking\" turns your ordinary action into a sneaky way for attackers to take control of your account or change your device settings.",

      "Illustration of an individual being scammed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "An illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why is it a threat?",
      "The scary part is how invisible this trick is. Double-clicking is something we all do automatically, often without giving it a second thought. But that simple action could be giving hackers permission to:",

      "Change your browser settings",
      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "How to protect yourself",
      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "Tom from Carol Stream, Illinois, reached out to us with this same problem: \"When I\u2019m out of town and my internet goes down, all of my \u2018internet of things\u2019 goes down too. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to turn off my router and turn it on again, but if I\u2019m not at home, is there anything I can do when I\u2019m out of town? Any help? It\u2019s very frustrating!\"",

      "How to reset your router remotely (the right way)",
      "Before we start, though, it's important to note that you will need administrator access to your router. Luckily, this is simple if it's your own home router. Unless you've changed the settings, your router uses the default username and password for its model, which you can find by a simple web search. However, leaving your router at default settings is a serious security risk. Make sure to change the default login and local IP address as soon as possible.",
      "If you're at home, you can use your local network IP (typically http://192.168.1.1) to log in to your router. This only works when your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is known as LAN (Local Area Network) access.",
      "If you're away from home (like at work or in a hotel), you won\u2019t be able to use 192.168.x.x to access your router. Instead, you\u2019d need to use your router\u2019s public IP address (also called WAN address). This requires setting up remote access in advance, usually by enabling remote management, Dynamic DNS or using a VPN. Be aware that this can open your network up to security vulnerabilities if not done carefully.",
      "Important: Allowing your router to be administered from the internet (WAN) is not recommended for most users due to the significant security risks. If you choose to do this, use strong, unique passwords, and consider VPN access instead.",
      "Use your ISP\u2019s app",
      "The safest and easiest method \u2014 if available \u2014 is to use your internet service provider\u2019s app. Most of the major ISPs in North America now allow you to reset your networking equipment remotely via a smartphone app, making it even easier to reset your router. This assumes you are using their router and not one you purchased for yourself. If you use a third-party router, you'll need to follow the steps above to reset it. Using an ISP app avoids opening your home network to the internet directly and usually includes built-in security protections.",

      "A smart plug lets you power cycle your router from anywhere by turning the plug off and on using a mobile app. This is a much safer option than enabling remote router access. It doesn't require exposing your router to the internet.",
      "Smart plugs come with smartphone apps that will allow you to set schedules and remotely turn and off and on plugs around your house, including the plug you plug your router into.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "If there\u2019s one thing that has become clear over the past year, it\u2019s that Apple devices are not as secure as the company wants you to believe.",
      "We\u2019re four months into 2025 and there have already been over 10 instances in which attackers specifically targeted Apple users, and these are just the incidents we know of.",
      "I\u2019ll admit no device is foolproof, but there seems to be a growing trend where bad actors prefer targeting Apple users over other platforms. In fact, security researchers have recently identified a new phishing campaign in which hackers, who previously focused on Windows, are now setting their sights on Apple IDs.",

      "A person working on an Apple laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications. The phishing pages have been redesigned to resemble Apple\u2019s security warnings, making them appear legitimate to macOS users. The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning. Believing their Apple ID is at risk, victims are tricked into entering their credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the attackers.",

      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Apple has long sold the idea that its ecosystem is inherently safer than the alternatives, but that claim is starting to wear thin. The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

      "Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.",

      "Hollywood movies",
      "China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world\u2019s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.",

      "U.S. services sector and intellectual property",
      "The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.",
      "U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China\u2019s State Council released Wednesday.",
      "China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.",
      "The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.",
      "Fentanyl cooperation",
      "China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.",

The two families, brought together by a tragic mistake, are now learning to cope with the pain that was inflicted upon them decades ago.",
      "\u201cThey are completely responsible,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cThey made one calamitous mistake, and they totally changed the course of my life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas has reignited familiar anti-vaccine tactics: claiming there are readily available treatments for the disease while sowing doubt in the safety of vaccines.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Sunday touted two particular medications that have not been shown to work as first-line treatments for measles: the steroid budesonide and the antibiotic clarithromycin.",
      "Although experts say there are no specific treatments proven to help people recover faster from measles, Kennedy claimed on X that the medications had been instrumental in treating around 300 children in Texas, and told Fox News that doctors prescribing them had seen \u201cvery, very good results.\u201d Kennedy has been sharply criticized by medical experts for weeks for spreading misinformation about the measles vaccine and failing to encourage parents to vaccinate their children. (He has since said that the vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles, and on Wednesday said that people should get it.)",
      "Since January, measles has taken off in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. Families in the community have turned to questionable remedies like budesonide to treat their illnesses \u2014 in some cases, at the recommendation of two Texas doctors, Dr. Ben Edwards and Dr. Richard Bartlett.",
      "On Sunday, Kennedy called Edwards and Bartlett \u201cextraordinary healers\u201d who have \u201ctreated and healed\u201d hundreds of children with budesonide and clarithromycin, sharing a photo of himself and the doctors with three Mennonite families whose children had become ill. Two of the families had each recently lost a daughter to measles: 6-year-old Kayley Fehr died in February and 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand died last week. Neither child was vaccinated.",
      "Edwards, a conventionally trained doctor who has shifted to promoting natural remedies and prayer, has been operating a makeshift clinic in Seminole, offering children these unproven treatments \u2014 including, according to a video posted by an anti-vaccine group, while he said he was sick with measles. Edwards has allied himself with the anti-vaccine movement in recent months, hosting influencers and activists on his podcast, including Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center, Brian Hooker of Children\u2019s Health Defense and Andrew Wakefield, the discredited British doctor behind a retracted study that fraudulently linked autism to the MMR vaccine.",
      "In addition to the two measles deaths in Texas, an adult in New Mexico died in early March. While the death is still under investigation, the individual tested positive for measles after death. There have been 657 measles cases so far this year, the highest total since 2019 when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York, according to NBC News\u2019 tally of state health department data. Most are tied to the Texas outbreak, which has spilled into several neighboring states. The vast majority of patients were not vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.",
      "There are no treatments for measles itself, although children may need medical care to treat complications, such as pneumonia. Because of this, public health experts emphasize the importance of getting two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which are 97% effective at preventing the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence to support the use of either aerosolized budesonide or clarithromycin for treatment of children with measles,\u201d said Dr. Adam Ratner, a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Prescribing treatments that have not been vetted in clinical trials amounts to experimenting on patients, added Dr. Susan McLellan, a professor in the infectious diseases division at the University of Texas Medical Branch.",
      "\u201cIt is very understandable that people want to grasp onto a hopeful remedy,\u201d McLellan said. \u201cIt is unfortunate when trusted providers of advice, such as those in higher levels of our government, are not very clearly stating what is upheld by scientific evidence and what is not.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy has offered clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles.",
      "Edwards declined to comment. Bartlett did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The misinformation playbook",
      "During the Covid pandemic, fringe doctors hyped unproven cures like ivermectin \u2014 an antiparasitic drug typically used for worm infections \u2014 while making unsubstantiated claims about the dangers of mRNA shots. Kennedy himself told podcaster Joe Rogan in 2023 that ivermectin was discredited because various groups stood to make money off Covid vaccines.",
      "Edwards and Bartlett, the doctors treating measles patients in Texas, have a similar history of questioning vaccine safety. Edwards shared dubious claims about injuries and deaths related to Covid vaccines at a Texas state legislative hearing in 2021. And Bartlett touted budesonide as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d to treat Covid during the pandemic.",
      "During the measles outbreak, they have each warned of risks associated with the MMR vaccine: Edwards claimed, falsely, that it causes \u201cpotentially\u201d hundreds of deaths a year and Bartlett has said that the complications caused by measles, including brain swelling and pneumonia, can also be caused by the vaccine. In reality, the MMR vaccine, which is only given to children with healthy immune systems, has been overwhelmingly safe since its approval more than five decades ago, and has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide. Some people may experience temporary side effects such as a fever, rash or joint pain, which are expected after vaccination.",
      "Measles, on the other hand, is highly contagious and can be life-threatening for the unvaccinated. On average, measles kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.",
      "But anti-vaccine activists have tried to link the two recent pediatric deaths to medical malpractice instead, which NBC News could not verify. On an episode of Edwards\u2019 podcast, \u201cYou\u2019re the Cure,\u201d on Monday, Bartlett attributed at least one measles death in the U.S. to \u201cmedical error,\u201d claiming that a child had not been treated with the appropriate antibiotic for a secondary bacterial infection.",
      "Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital, which treated the first child who died, called such claims circulating online \u201cmisleading and inaccurate.\u201d University Medical Center Children\u2019s Hospital, which treated the second child, said in a statement Sunday that the patient had no known underlying health conditions and was receiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.",
      "Dr. Robert Malone, an anti-vaccine activist, similarly suggested in his newsletter over the weekend that the two pediatric deaths were due to medical error, and that budesonide could have saved at least one child\u2019s life.",
      "What the science actually says",
      "Budesonide is normally used to treat inflammatory diseases. In capsule form, it\u2019s an effective treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease. And its inhaled form can reduce asthma symptoms.",
      "Bartlett said on Edwards\u2019 podcast that he realized, through divine intervention in March 2020, that budesonide could help save the lives of people who were critically ill with Covid.",
      "\u201cWhile I was asleep, an answer to prayer came to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will shut down the release of the cytokines, the inflammatory chemicals from the lung lining.\u201d",
      "He pointed to trials out of the University of Oxford that he said supported that claim. The trials showed that budesonide could shorten recovery times in nonhospitalized patients, but there\u2019s no firm evidence that it can reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid.",
      "Steroids should not be given early in the course of a viral infection like measles, because they inhibit the immune system, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not what you want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cYour immune system works for you\u201d to fight measles.",
      "Doctors do use steroids in people with Covid who have late-stage pneumonia if their immune system has become overactive, Offit said.",
      "Doctors prescribe budesonide, administered by either an inhaler or nasal spray, to reduce wheezing in people with asthma, he added. While people with measles develop a cough, they don\u2019t really wheeze.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s suggestion that measles patients could benefit from clarithromycin similarly lacks context, pediatricians and infectious disease doctors said.",
      "Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria, not viruses, so they don\u2019t work against measles itself. But measles can weaken the body so much that people develop a bacterial infection such as staphylococcus or streptococcus.",
      "Offit said doctors typically treat such infections with a combination of antibiotics called vancomycin and ceftriaxone. These medications are given intravenously, he said, whereas clarithromycin usually comes in pill form. Studies show it\u2019s more effective to treat severe infections, such as bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, with intravenous antibiotics, which help ensure that adequate levels of the antibiotics make it into the bloodstream. Patients who take antibiotics by mouth may not receive a high enough dose to combat a serious infection, because the medication has to go through the intestines, where it may not be fully absorbed.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t treat severe infections orally,\u201d Offit said. \u201cIt would be too risky.\u201d",
      "Clarithromycin is also a broad-spectrum antibiotic, meaning it targets a wide range of bacteria, said Dr. Paul Kilgore, a professor at Wayne State University\u2019s Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.",
      "\u201cIf we treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics, we don\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019re treating [and] we run the risk of increasing antibiotic resistance,\u201d he said.",
      "Public health experts said touting these medications as first-line treatments sends the wrong message.",
      "\u201cBy mentioning such treatments without that context, RFK Jr. continues to distract away from the prevention measure that incontrovertibly works \u2014 the vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security."

    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The baseless conspiracy theory that the Fort Knox gold might be gone, spread by Musk and Trump, was also popular in the 1970s.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have fanned the flames of a baseless rumor about America\u2019s gold reserves at least a dozen times since mid-February.",
      "The conspiracy theory, alleging without evidence that someone might have stolen the gold reserves from Fort Knox, Kentucky, has circulated for decades, but it seems to have first appeared on the Trump administration\u2019s radar after far-right financial blog Zero Hedge tagged Musk in a post about the idea on X.",
      "Since then, Musk and Trump have shared the idea and teased plans for a personal inspection of the fortress that holds the government\u2019s gold bars.",
      "Despite raising alarm and fueling conspiracy chatter online and offline, there is no evidence that any gold is missing, and there\u2019s no indication that Musk or Trump has taken any concrete steps toward visiting Fort Knox. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on their plans, saying in an email: \u201cNo announcements at this time.\u201d",
      "The rumor immediately found an audience, including gold obsessives who have nurtured conspiracy theories about government gold reserves for more than 50 years. Many of them stubbornly reject the evidence that Fort Knox is secure, and they interpret its security measures as evidence that the government is hiding something.",
      "Aaron Klein, the chair of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the statements by Musk and Trump fit a pattern of the two men trying to sow doubt in traditional institutions.",
      "\u201cThe gold has come to have a symbolic value of the faith in the U.S. government\u2019s fundamental position,\u201d said Klein, who served in the Obama Treasury Department.",
      "\u201cQuestioning the gold as having been \u2018lost\u2019 or \u2018stolen\u2019 is part of a series of actions that undermine confidence in America,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy somebody who purports to be trying to restore America would want to undermine its confidence is confusing.\u201d",
      "Trump and Musk are tapping into a classic but obscure rumor with a long history: People have recycled the claim that Fort Knox is empty on a semiregular basis, sometimes paired with vague anti-government vibes.",
      "\u201cIt comes up periodically, and it has for decades,\u201d said Philip Diehl, a former director of the U.S. Mint, which oversees the gold storage. \u201cEventually, the pressure builds, and the president sends somebody in to take a look.\u201d",
      "In 1974, after a gadfly author named Peter Beter charged that unnamed powerful interests had looted Fort Knox, the rumor spread so widely that the U.S. Mint decided to invite lawmakers and journalists for a tour. And in 2011, then-Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who favored abolishing the Federal Reserve and returning to a gold-based currency system, held a congressional hearing on whether the Fort Knox gold was secure.\u00a0Treasury officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have repeatedly said the gold is fine, and in 2017, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary at the time, Steven Mnuchin, visited the Kentucky fortress and came away satisfied.",
      "\u201cThe gold was there when I visited it. I hope nobody\u2019s moved it. I\u2019m sure they haven\u2019t,\u201d Mnuchin, who isn\u2019t serving in Trump\u2019s second administration, told CNBC in February.",
      "Trump\u2019s current treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told podcast host Dan O\u2019Donnell in February: \u201cAll the gold is present and accounted for.\u201d",
      "No visit has materialized in the nearly two months since then, and it\u2019s not clear why.",
      "Paul, the former congressman, said he\u2019s not sure Musk and Trump will follow through. He has criticized Trump at times, including for bombing Yemen last month.",
      "\u201cThey have other things to deal with. They have to plan the bombing in Yemen, and they have to deal with the oil in Syria. They have to stop a war on Ukraine, and so the gold they can forget about for a while. They\u2019ll avoid it if they see an advantage to it. So that is why people don\u2019t trust governments,\u201d he said.",
      "Paul said he believes past audits haven\u2019t been thorough enough. He wants Trump and Musk to perform lab tests known as assays to determine the exact composition of the gold bars.",
      "The gold reserve used to have a practical purpose: to allow foreign governments to swap their dollars for gold. But President Richard Nixon ended the practice in 1971. Now, its value is mainly symbolic of U.S. wealth, and other countries, such as China, have recently sought to build up their own reserves.",
      "The gold theft rumors have come in several varieties, all without evidence, among them that European bankers took the gold or that the Rockefeller banking family did.",
      "Certain conspiracy theories tend to pop up repeatedly over time, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow who studies disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, a nonprofit organization that works to strengthen the U.S.-Europe alliance. Allegedly government-made bioweapons are one such recurring conspiracy theory, he said, and the Fort Knox gold rumor is another.",
      "\u201cThese rumors work best when they\u2019re built up over time. It\u2019s like Hollywood sequels: You build off the original,\u201d he said. And in both cases, he added, \u201cyou just get a lot of retreads.\u201d",
      "Fort Knox has appeared in movies that add to its allure. A scheme involving the facility is a major plot point in the 1964 James Bond film \u201cGoldfinger,\u201d underscoring the belief that Fort Knox could be a tempting target.",
      "And unlike some internet-era hoaxes, the Fort Knox rumors originated in an age when conspiracy theories spread by less efficient means, not on X, whose owner, Musk, has 218 million listed followers.",
      "\u201cIt precedes the social media digital age, but now we\u2019re in an environment where things can pop from the corners of \u2018conspiracy land\u2019 to policy action in a matter of hours, because all of you have to do is land on Musk\u2019s radar,\u201d Schafer said.",
      "Formally known as the U.S. Bullion Depository, the gold reserve site is next to the Army base Fort Knox. It was built in 1936, and President Franklin Roosevelt was the only visitor until the tour for media and members of Congress in 1974.",
      "The tour 51 years ago yielded newspaper headlines such as one in The New York Times: \u201cVisitors Get a Peek at Fort Knox Gold\u2014It\u2019s There.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department\u2019s nonpartisan inspector general audits the gold every year, said Eric Thorson, a former inspector general who\u2019s now retired. He said that he sent teams of about three people every year and that he went personally once in 2011.",
      "\u201cThere is absolutely zero doubt the gold is there,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a former Air Force pilot. I\u2019ve been on bases with nuclear weapons, and this place has every bit the security that any nuclear base has,\u201d he added. \u201cThe security is unbelievable. Nobody\u2019s going to go in there and take it.\u201d",
      "Zero Hedge, a far-right financial blog and social media brand that appears to have first alerted Musk to the idea, frequently posts about gold as an investment. It tweeted in 2011 about Paul\u2019s Fort Knox concerns and in 2017 about Mnuchin\u2019s Fort Knox visit. Sometimes, accounts on X respond to Zero Hedge posts with commentary about Fort Knox.",
      "Then, on Feb. 15, Zero Hedge posted a suggestion on X and tagged Musk directly.",
      "\u201cIt would be great if @elonmusk could take a look inside Fort Knox just to make sure the 4,580 tons of US gold is there. Last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974,\u201d the account posted.",
      "The second sentence is wrong, according to Thorson,\u00a0but the post got the attention of Musk and others. It had 3.3 million views as of Friday.",
      "\u201cSurely it\u2019s reviewed at least every year?\u201d Musk responded to the post. Zero Hedge replied, repeating the falsehood that the gold isn\u2019t reviewed every year.",
      "Google Trends data shows that after the interaction, web searches for the term \u201cFort Knox\u201d hit their highest level since Google began collecting data in 2004 and kept rising for several days.",
      "On Feb. 16, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Paul\u2019s son, chimed in. He repeated the inaccuracy that the gold isn\u2019t reviewed annually and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Zero Hedge has often faced restrictions on tech platforms for violating terms of service, including publishing allegedly derogatory material. In 2022, U.S. intelligence officials accused the site of amplifying Russian propaganda, a claim it denied. But under Musk\u2019s ownership of X, Zero Hedge has thrived, growing its follower count from 1.5 million to 2.1 million.",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also discussed the Fort Knox rumor on his podcast. He said he supported Musk\u2019s looking into Fort Knox while acknowledging that he heard the same rumor as a child more than 40 years ago. Jones\u2019 sponsors and advertisers have for years included gold retailers.",
      "Soon, Musk and Trump were fueling the uncertainty. On Feb. 17, Musk posted on X about the gold: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s there, maybe it\u2019s not.\u201d He spoke about it on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast and at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, often mixing the conspiracy theory with attempts at humor.",
      "\u201cWe want to go see it and just make sure somebody didn\u2019t spray-paint some lead or something, you know?\u201d Musk said at CPAC on Feb. 20.",
      "Musk reiterated his intention to inspect the goal as recently as March 30 at a town hall-style event in Wisconsin, after an unidentified audience member raised the subject.\u00a0\u201cYou were going to go check our gold, and I\u2019m worried about the Democrats and Joe Biden\u2019s last administration with the money not being there,\u201d the audience member said.",
      "\u201cDid you get blocked? Or are you still able to check that?\u201d he asked.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up to the president, of course, but I think it would be awesome to livestream Fort Knox,\u201d Musk responded. \u201cHopefully it looks really cool.\u201d",
      "Trump mentioned it to reporters several times, including in the Oval Office on Feb. 24. He has a longtime fascination with gold, with a golden escalator at one of his New York towers and a chocolate bar wrapped in gold foil for sale on his website for $86.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold,\u201d Trump said, without citing any evidence.",
      "The gold facility doesn\u2019t offer tours, and its website is blunt: \u201cNo visitors are permitted in the facility.\u201d But the Treasury Department answers to the president and would presumably let him in. The department didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "The U.S. Mint says Fort Knox holds about 147.3 million ounces of gold currently, or about half the Treasury\u2019s total gold reserves. That\u2019s worth about $450 billion at the current market price \u2014 which is both a massive fortune and not enough to cover what the federal government spends in a single month.",
      "Diehl, who was director of the U.S. Mint in the 1990s, said there\u2019s a lot of overlap between Trump\u2019s voting base and people who invest in metals such as gold or commemorative coins.",
      "\u201cTalking about gold speaks directly to his base,\u201d said Diehl, who\u2019s now the president of U.S. Money Reserve, a gold retailer.",
      "Diehl said he\u2019s certain the Fort Knox gold is secure, and yet he said he anticipates a surprise announcement of some kind by Trump, just given his approaching to governing: maybe selling the gold, maybe buying more, maybe something else entirely.",
      "The price of gold soared to record highs in recent days amid concerns about Trump\u2019s trade wars before they fell again along with other asset prices since last week\u2019s tariff announcement. It\u2019s unclear whether Musk or Trump has any personal gold holdings.",
      "Thorson, the retired Treasury Department inspector general, said he believes the Fort Knox rumors are politically useful for Trump and Musk.",
      "\u201cWhat is probably happening here is taking any chance to make the American public feel that they\u2019re being taken advantage of and that they\u2019re a victim,\u201d he said. Now, he said, Trump and Musk can position themselves as saviors in the mold of Trump\u2019s 2016 statement \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d",
      "And the longer the visit doesn\u2019t happen, the more useful the rumors become for anyone who benefits from them.",
      "\u201cIf the intent is to undermine the financial system, you don\u2019t actually want anyone to go there and look,\u201d said Schafer, of the German Marshall Fund."

      "Warning: This story discusses eating disorders. If you or a loved one is struggling with an eating disorder, the National Eating Disorders Association offers a\u00a0free and confidential screening tool,\u00a0support, resources and treatment options.",
      "As an anti-diet culture influencer in recovery from an eating disorder, Phaith Montoya says she prefers not to engage with body-shaming social media posts. She tells TODAY.com she\u2019d retired from battling people in the comments on TikTok \u2014\u00a0until last month, when so many of her 3 million followers started asking her about #SkinnyTok that she decided to take a look.",
      "The content posted with the hashtag reminded her of the 2010s-era \u201cpro-anorexia Tumblr\u201d and \u201ceating disorder Twitter,\u201d so she decided to speak out in a\u00a0TikTok\u00a0that\u2019s since gotten over a million views.",
      "Montoya, 27, was about 9 years old when she was first put on a diet. She ate less than her brother but weighed more, and her doctor was concerned. Without any referrals to counselors or dietitians, she says her parents did the best they could.",
      "Montoya cycled through restrictive fad diets and their emotional fallout for years, and eventually was diagnosed with hypothyroid disease, which can lead to weight gain, among other symptoms,\u00a0according to Mayo Clinic. In college, she started seeing mental health and nutrition professionals who gave her science-backed tools and support. She also learned she\u2019d been struggling with binge-eating disorder.",
      "Now years into her recovery, Montoya says she was still \u201cso jarred, so taken aback\u201d by what she saw on SkinnyTok.",
      "\u201cI know that if I had seen that (advice) when I was younger, I would have thought I needed it, too,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt inclined to speak for the girl that I was.\u201d",
      "In her response video, Montoya explained that her mental health was at its lowest when her eating disorder peaked, and her \u201clife completely changed when I just stopped hating myself.\u201d She said she wanted to reject the message she observed in so many SkinnyTok videos \u2014 that thinness leads to happiness.",
      "What is SkinnyTok?",
      "\u201cSkinnyTok\u201d is hugely successful by the numbers, with thousands of posts and millions of views across several platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and a\u00a0popular Reddit thread. A Google search estimates there are about 38,000 TikTok posts with the hashtag.",
      "The results page for \u201cSkinnyTok\u201d on the platform that inspired the name shows a message that reads, \u201cYou are more than your weight,\u201d which, if tapped on, shares links to help find support for disordered eating, including\u00a0the National Eating Disorder Association\u00a0(NEDA). TikTok\u2019s health resources were developed in collaboration with experts like Cleveland Clinic,\u00a0National Institute of Mental Health,\u00a0World Health Organization and more, a spokesperson says.",
      "But beneath this banner are thousands of videos displaying weight-loss advice, body checks and before-and-afters packaged with words like \u201cdiscipline,\u201d \u201ctough love\u201d and \u201chard truths.\u201d",
      "Creators in the SkinnyTok world, most of whom appear to be women in their teens and 20s, often reshare their favorite \u201cSkinnyTok\u201d sayings. Some common ones are:",
      "\u201cIf your stomach is growling, pretend it\u2019s applauding you.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo be small, eat small. To be big, eat big.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a treat. You\u2019re not a dog.\u201d",
      "On a given day, SkinnyTok devotees \u2014 and there are plenty \u2014 may be exposed to videos recommending calorie counts so low that I, as a registered dietitian, would almost never suggest them, not for a petite woman nor a still-growing teen. Research shows that\u00a0extreme weight loss and fad diets don\u2019t work\u00a0in the long term, typically ending in regain, and the changes in metabolism and hormones\u00a0may leave a person struggling more\u00a0than before.",
      "I also encountered little to no content about important nutrients like calcium, iron or vitamin D in my time searching the hashtag. Another theme noticeably missing? Joy, whether from moving your body, a tasty, nutritious meal, or achieving\u00a0a non-scale victory.",
      "According to TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, it does \u201cnot allow showing or promoting disordered eating and dangerous weight loss behaviors.\u201d However, content \u201cthat shows or promotes potentially harmful\u00a0weight management\u201d is allowed but restricted to people 18 or older and doesn\u2019t appear on the For You Feed.",
      "The TikTok algorithm also blocks repetitive content patterns, which can prevent videos about weight loss, extreme exercise and similar topics from being viewed too often, according to a spokesperson.",
      "Is the advice on SkinnyTok that harmful?",
      "Much of the advice on SkinnyTok boils down to eating less and moving more as the only way to lose weight, and it ignores the complexity of the science around weight loss and the relationship between health and weight. (TikTok says it works with independent fact-checkers and public health authorities to verify the accuracy of content and may apply warning labels when it cannot be verified.)",
      "But the main concern of the experts I spoke to was that many videos were encouraging viewers to feel shame around certain habits, which can have lasting, dangerous effects,\u00a0research shows.",
      "Scrolling through SkinnyTok, \u201cI hear, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough. You\u2019re not trying hard enough,\u2019\u201d Paula Edwards-Gayfield, licensed professional counselor and NEDA board member, tells TODAY.com. \u201cIf we remove the external behaviors, what\u2019s underlying eating disorders is this core belief that I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d",
      "Feelings of shame can make weight loss and implementing healthier behaviors more difficult,\u00a0research shows, whereas self-compassion makes them more likely. That\u2019s why I often tell my clients that their bodies deserve respect right now because shame-style coaching is based on bias, not science.",
      "Dietitian Andrea Mathis of the\u00a0Beautiful Eats and Things\u00a0blog recently wrote about SkinnyTok\u2019s \u201cdangerous rise\u201d and how she understands why people are clamoring for content that claims to help you become the ideal body type.",
      "\u201cIntentional weight loss is sometimes the right thing to suggest, and I\u2019ve seen people say (SkinnyTok) has made them more\u00a0aware of what they put into their body,\u201d Mathis tells TODAY.com.",
      "While there\u2019s nothing wrong with that on the surface, she worries there\u2019s too much emphasis on restriction. \u201cMaybe it starts one way, but the more you do it with that mindset, it can turn into obsession,\u201d she explains.",
      "According to NEDA, exposure to weight stigma, in particular the message that \u201cthinner is better,\u201d can lead to disordered eating behaviors or a diagnosable eating disorder. People who struggle with depression and anxiety have a higher risk of eating disorders, and\u00a0research links\u00a0social media use to these conditions.",
      "People with eating disorders,\u00a0about 9% of the U.S. population, often get trapped in a\u00a0lifelong recovery process\u00a0and sustain\u00a0physical damage, including heart problems, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive declines, organ failure and more.",
      "For many, the struggle turns fatal. Eating disorders, especially anorexia, are among\u00a0the deadliest mental health conditions, alongside substance use disorders.\u00a0People of color are especially at risk because they\u2019re less likely to receive care,\u00a0according to NEDA.",
      "If you\u2019re interested in losing weight, it\u2019s best to talk to a dietitian or other health professional. The most effective approach for you will depend on your age, medical history and more, and you can\u2019t get that specificity from an influencer online.",
      "\u201cEven if some of the creators have good intentions, they are sometimes giving nutrition advice, which they should not do,\u201d Mathis says.",
      "Liam Fisher-Layton, a fitness content creator, tries to combat shame-fueled weight loss tactics on social media, in particular for men and boys,\u00a0who are also at risk of eating disorders. He prefers to highlight the benefits of protein, fiber and other nutrients, as well as fun activity, instead of restriction and punishing gym routines.",
      "\u201cWhat I see a lot of (men and boys) saying is, \u2018I need the toxic motivation,\u2019\u201d which he finds unfortunate, he tells TODAY.com. \u201cMaybe it helps this small percentage of people, and it doesn\u2019t cause an eating disorder, but how many others are going to be harmed? Is the benefit worth the cost? To me, absolutely not.\u201d",
      "Is body-shaming back?",
      "Mathis says seeing the SkinnyTok trend \u201cbroke my heart. I felt like we were going backwards.\u201d",
      "But body-shaming never really left us, according to Martha Laham, author of \u201cMade Up\u201c and an expert on body image and marketing.",
      "\u201cSkinnyTok is just another version of something we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Citing the\u00a01920s flapper diet, the 1960s obsession with supermodel\u00a0Twiggy\u00a0and 1990s \u201cheroin chic,\u201d Laham says, \u201cThe types of media and how we pursue it may be new, but the thin ideal has always been there when we take a historical look at Western beauty.\u201d",
      "Edwards-Gayfield agrees that SkinnyTok is just an extension of the already prevalent, restrictive \u201cdiet mentality.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just really (embodies) the entirety of what my patients experience,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt is so ever-present that it\u2019s difficult for people to acknowledge that it\u2019s dieting. It\u2019s easy to normalize it because people don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with the behavior.\u201d",
      "Laham points out in her book that decades of research show clear ties between consumption of \u201cappearance-focused media\u201d and disordered eating and body image, especially for young women. She hopes more people can learn to see through it.",
      "When to get help",
      "If you\u2019re worried you or a loved one might be at risk of an eating disorder due to social media, keep in mind\u00a0the warning signs, Edwards-Gayfield says.",
      "For example, are your thoughts increasingly consumed with diet and exercise routines? Are you withdrawing from meals with friends and family because you need to adhere to a strict regimen?",
      "\u201cThis is where things start to go into disordered territory,\u201d and it\u2019s time to\u00a0get help, she says. That\u2019s especially true when a person turns to other harmful, \u201cemotionally driven\u201d behaviors, such as exercising when injured or substance use, she adds.",
      "The bottom line? You may be able to learn some tips on social media that can help you meet your fitness goals, especially if you\u2019re focused first on caring for yourself, but experts agree you can\u2019t hate yourself healthy.",
      "For example, I often recommend unsweetened sparkling water as a\u00a0replacement for soda\u00a0to reduce added sugar and foster an appreciation for less sweet tastes.\u00a0What I don\u2019t do is suggest it as a replacement for a meal.",
      "You may also want to try curating your feed. On TikTok, it\u2019s possible \u201cto filter out videos with words or hashtags (you) don\u2019t want to see from (your) For You or Following feed,\u201d\u00a0the website notes. Just go to your content preferences, and add the keyword you no longer want to engage with.",
      "Following creators and groups who nourish your mind, body and soul can also make your feed more positive. Here are a few suggestions from the experts, as well as my own:",
      "Chrissy King, author of \u201cThe Body Liberation Project\u201dThe Nutrition Tea, Shana Minei Spence, dietitian and author of \u201cLive Nourished\u201dPhaith Montoya, eating disorder advocate and NAMI ambassadorBeautiful Eats and Things\u00a0with Andrea Mathis, dietitianThe Plant Slant, Liam Fisher-Layton, for comments on everyday nutrition and fitness trendsDiets Don\u2019t Work\u00a0with anorexia survivor and advocate Debbie LeskoKeep it Up, Cutie, with comedian and body-positive advocate Anna PrzyJoshua McFadden, author of \u201cSix Seasons: A New Way With Vegetables\u201dYour Latina Nutritionist, Dalina Soto, dietitian and author of \u201cThe Latina Anti-Diet\u201dProject Heal, a nonprofit for accessible eating disorder recoveryIlona Maher, Olympic rugby champion",

      "The Trump administration is pulling funding from the Maine Department of Corrections over a transgender woman who is being housed in a women\u2019s prison,\u00a0U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an interview Tuesday.",
      "\"We pulled all nonessential funding from the Department of Corrections in Maine, because they were allowing a man in a woman's prison,\" Bondi told Fox News.",
      "Bondi did not provide an amount during the interview, but Fox News reported it would be $1.5 million.",
      "The inmate Bondi was referring to is Andrea Balcer, who was sentenced to 40 years in prison in 2018 for the murder of her parents and family dog. Balcer\u2019s attorney argued that she was going through a gender identity transformation and that her parents were not accepting. Balcer had no criminal record before the killings on Oct. 31, 2016, at her family home in Winthrop, Maine. She was 17 at the time.",
      "Balcer is currently incarcerated at the Maine Correction Center\u2019s Women\u2019s Center, according to the Maine Department of Corrections' online inmate database.",
      "\u201cWe will pull your funding, we will protect women in prison, we will protect women in sports, we will protect women throughout this country,\u201d Bondi said in the interview.",
      "The Maine Department of Corrections released a statement Tuesday saying, in part, that it is \"evaluating the impacts to services from these funding terminations.\"",
      "The department noted that the funding will affect three grant programs: Improving Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery Outcomes for Adults in Reentry; Second Chance Act Addressing the Needs of Incarcerated Parents and Their Minor Children; and Smart Probation: Innovations in Supervision Initiative.",
      "Advocacy groups criticized the move.",
      "\u201cIf the federal government truly cares about women, all women, they would not withdraw funding for essential programs that lead to public safety in our communities,\u201d Jan Collins, assistant director of the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition, said Tuesday.",
      "Maine has already been a target of an attempt to pull federal funding. The Department of Agriculture has\u00a0paused federal funding\u00a0for certain state educational programs over the state\u2019s compliance with Title IX, the law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.",
      "At issue is Maine\u2019s allowing of a transgender athlete to participate in women\u2019s sports. It comes after a public confrontation between Maine Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump, which ended in Mills telling the president, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d The federal government then launched an investigation into Maine\u2019s policies, which found that Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals\u2019 Association and a high school in the state were in violation of Title IX.",

      "\u201cSays a lot about the group,\u201d said Sherwood, who took Conor Garland\u2019s pass from behind Dallas\u2019 net in the low slot and fired a shot past Casey DeSmith. \u201c\u2018Gar\u2019 just made an absolute crazy play. Kind of felt like slow motion, got his head up and put it on my tape.\u201d",

The Senate measure requires a minimum of $4 billion in cuts, while a budget blueprint the House passed earlier this year called for $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in cuts. While Senate GOP leaders insist their blueprint is just a minimum and not a target, House conservatives distrust them and argue the plan would explode the national debt.",
      "But Johnson, who attended Trump\u2019s meeting with some Republican holdouts at the White House on Tuesday, said he understands the fiscal concerns of conservatives and acknowledged they still have some work to do to get enough votes.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s willing to help. He told me that this morning. But I think we get this job done,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI understand the concerns of holdouts. Their concerns are real. They really want to have true budget cuts and to change the debt trajectory that the country is on. So do I.\u201d",
      "Johnson is also using a vehicle to bring the budget resolution to the floor, known as a \"rule,\" to try to prohibit the House from voting to terminate the emergency declaration that Trump used to impose aggressive tariffs on goods from around the world. The tariff agenda was in flux Wednesday as Trump announced a 90-day pause on countries that weren't retaliating, while escalating U.S. tariffs on China to 125%.",
      "Tucked inside the \"rule\" is language that would bar the House from voting through Sept. 30 on a joint resolution to revoke the declaration on April 2, which Trump labeled \"liberation day.\" The unusual move comes as Democrats are seeking to cobble together a majority of lawmakers to circumvent Republican leaders and force a vote on undoing the tariffs.",
      "That puts swing-district Republicans skeptical of Trump\u2019s tariffs in a difficult position. It means any lawmaker who votes for the \u201crule\u201d to bring the budget resolution to a vote would also be voting, in effect, to protect Trump\u2019s tariffs until October.",
      "Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to terminate the April 2 emergency. So far Meeks has 36 co-sponsors, all Democrats. But some Republicans like Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska have expressed interest in giving authority over tariffs back to Congress.",
      "The two issues are coming to a head just before Congress is seeking to break for a two-week recess, with Republican leaders eager not to send members home empty-handed on the budget.",
      "Johnson defended his attempt to block votes to undo Trump's tariffs, arguing they need to give him some time to accomplish his objectives on trade policy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it very clear. I think the president has executive authority. It\u2019s an appropriate level of authority to deal with the unfair trade practices. That\u2019s part of the role of the president is to negotiate with other countries,\u201d Johnson said Wednesday. \u201cI think that is an America First policy that will be effective, and so we have to give him the space to do it.\u201d"

      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s administration attempts to lower inflation by reducing government spending, Americans are finding out the very programs putting healthy, affordable foods on their plates are on the chopping block.",
      "A pair of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs \u2014 one that funds the purchase of local farm-fresh foods\u00a0for school cafeterias\u00a0and another that funds much of the product available in food banks \u2014\u00a0were cut for 2025, amounting to more than $1 billion in purchasing.",
      "In addition to the $660 million slashed from school food programs, the USDA cut $500 million specifically intended to help food banks and domestic agriculture. The latter came from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) branch of the USDA\u2019s Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP).",
      "Food banks around the country had been counting on that $500 million to feed millions of families and individuals experiencing hunger this year. They use these funds to make purchases within the domestic food supply chain, and many months\u2019 worth of orders already placed by food banks have now been canceled.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with nine regional food banks, as well as a representative from Feeding America, to understand how these changes are affecting those relying on this food across the country.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Food Bank of South Jersey typically relies on the USDA for around 20% of its food supply. For the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, D.C., that\u2019s between 25 \u2014 30%, which funds roughly 14 million meals.",
      "Food Bank for the Heartland shared that it\u2019s projected to feed more than 1.6 million individuals and almost 600,000 households this year through its pantries across Nebraska and Iowa \u2014 numbers that will be tougher to reach with the reduced federal funding, as commodity purchases typically account for 20% of food sourced, with the rest coming from donations and retail purchases.",
      "The cuts amount to around 434,000 meals in its Nebraska counties and 76,000 in its Iowa counties, Heartland\u2019s president and CEO Brian Barks tells TODAY.com.",
      "On March 31, Great Plains Food Bank CEO Melissa Sobolik shared a cancellation order with TODAY.com. The notice shows a total loss of around $1.3 million of food, as well as a specific CCC order loss of 11,250 cases of eggs, 500 cases of pulled pork, 480 cases of sliced turkey breast, 1,365 cases of shredded cheddar, 900 cases of canned chicken, 578 cases of dried cranberries and 475 cases of frozen chicken legs.",
      "As of March 27, Food Bank of Iowa had 16 truckloads \u2014 nearly 400,000 pounds of food \u2014 that hadn\u2019t yet been canceled but were in question. They expected two loads in April and the remaining deliveries in May and June.",
      "\u201cOurs is among many food banks which simply don\u2019t know how this is going to play out,\u201d Annette Hacker, Food Bank of Iowa\u2019s VP of strategy and communications, told TODAY.com. She said they were already purchasing food (spending an estimated $1.12 million from April through July) to try and make up for the loss, \u201cand even that will not cover it.\u201d The next day, Hacker confirmed to TODAY.com that all 16 truckloads had been officially canceled.",
      "Feeding Tampa Bay was slated to provide around 100 million meals this year, of which the CCC funds around 20 million, CEO Thomas Mantz tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cNow, do I think we\u2019ll lose all of that? I don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be clear about that. We don\u2019t want to catastrophize, but that\u2019s the size of the partnership.\u201d",
      "Much of this remains uncertain",
      "Mantz clarified that what his team and peers were hearing coming out of D.C. wasn\u2019t exactly clear-cut. He is remaining hopeful and optimistic that things will change over time.",
      "\u201cI think we still don\u2019t quite know fully the impact of what this may be,\u201d Mantz says.",
      "Many of these canceled shipments weren\u2019t slated to start arriving until later in April or May, but representatives we spoke with say there\u2019s virtually no way to replace what\u2019s lost with donations or private fundraising \u2014 the gap is too large.",
      "\u201cPhilanthropy can\u2019t overcome this loss,\u201d Mantz says.",
      "But there are some privately funded food banks that don\u2019t rely on USDA funds at all or as heavily. A representative for New York food rescue program City Harvest tells TODAY.com the nonprofit was not impacted by the cuts.",
      "\u201cThese reductions don\u2019t just affect people facing hunger \u2014 they also hurt the retailers, farmers, and businesses that supply fresh, local food to our region,\u201d Beth Martino, CEO of Three Square Food Bank in Southern Nevada, tells TODAY.com.",
      "What is CCC?",
      "While the CCC (Commodity Credit Corporation) is a discretionary fund \u2014 meaning, it\u2019s up to each administration to decide what to do with \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s most recently been functioning as a way to help food banks acquire more food for the public while putting money directly into the pockets of individual American farmers. Leaders we spoke with said this first began in 2018, but the USDA didn\u2019t respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a program that works really well,\u201d says Mantz. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific private-public partnership.\u201d",
      "He says it \u201cenlivens\u201d the farming community, which faces its own challenges, and \u201cputs good, healthy food on the tables of those we serve, who will proportionately buy unhealthy food, because that stretches farther in the budget.\u201d",
      "The CCC is just one of three monetary arms of TEFAP. There\u2019s also the\u00a0entitlement fund\u00a0and Section 32 Bonus Product. The USDA\u00a0announced on March 24\u00a0that it had approved bonus spends for vegetables, fruits and tree nuts. Bryant says the spend amounts to $261 million, though TODAY.com could not independently verify the number.",
      "Several food banks we spoke with say they had seen bonus product offers come through at the end of March and beginning of April, where pantries can acquire preapproved goods without having to use their entitlement funds. These goods are typically designated as Section 32 when the product\u2019s market needs support, according to the\u00a0USDA. Hacker tells us that, on March 31, Food Bank of Iowa received two USDA bonus offers for fresh, dried and frozen fruit and tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAn enormous amount of the food that we provide at the Food Bank of South Jersey is local produce, local eggs, local dairy \u2014 almost all of our vendors,\u201d Geiger says. \u201cUsing state money, using donated money, and the money that comes through the TEFAP program.\u201d",
      "So, with these cuts, Mantz adds, \u201cnot only do you have less food in the community, not only do the farmers get less support federally, but you also start to introduce long-term health outcomes that are potentially negative for people that don\u2019t have access to good, healthy, nutritious food.\u201d",
      "Sarah F. Geiger, senior director of programs and services for Food Bank of South Jersey, tells TODAY.com the number of people they\u2019re feeding has only increased since the pandemic. She says the USDA funds have been crucial for them the past few years as both individuals and companies have less money to donate.",
      "And as demand for food banks continues to climb, reducing their resources is detrimental to feeding hungry neighbors.",
      "Demand is high",
      "Geiger calls today\u2019s levels of demand \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has simply been unsustainable since the pandemic,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve not come back.\u201d",
      "This is especially true, Bryant says, for working families who aren\u2019t eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).",
      "\u201cFlorida is not traditionally a high-wage state,\u201d Mantz says. \u201cWe have a lot of tourism industry, leisure industry, and so from a need standpoint, in our community, we\u2019ve continued to see significant growth (in hunger). We don\u2019t see anything in the future that would change what\u2019s happening for the families that we serve.\u201d",
      "Radha Muthiah, CEO of Capital Area Food Bank, tells TODAY.com this reduction means neighbors experiencing hunger who come to the bank will be able to take home less food \u2014 and a smaller variety of food \u2014 than in the past few years.",
      "Pantries offer farm-fresh foods through these programs",
      "Food banks offer more than just the canned and packaged goods often asked for in donations. Thanks to partnerships with local farmers and funding through programs like the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement (LFPA), they are able to function like a farmers market, too.",
      "Since 2021, this program has been keeping food banks a source of fresh, nutritious and local produce and proteins. In December, the\u00a0USDA announced the availability of $1.3 billion for local food programs\u00a0\u2014 including Local Food for Schools (LFS) \u2014 and then came the $1 billion cut in March.",
      "When a food bank in Southern New Jersey, for example, is able to use dollars to purchase vegetables and meats from Southern Jersey farmers, not only is that money then staying within local communities, it\u2019s getting those relying on banks fresher and more nutritious foods. If someone in South Jersey can get their corn from a local farmer rather than a farmer in Illinois, there are fewer trucks on the road delivering that food, which means it spends less time in transit and can maintain peak levels of nutrients by the time it reaches your neighbor\u2019s plate.",
      "How can food banks afford to offer the same level of produce you\u2019d find at a high-priced urban farmers market? The LFPA funds.",
      "Who do these cuts hurt the most?",
      "Around 13.5% (or 18 million) of US households were food insecure at some point in 2023, according to the\u00a0USDA.\u00a0Feeding America\u00a0puts that number at around 47 million individuals.",
      "Vince Hall, chief growth revenue officer of Feeding America, says that while hunger affects such a large portion of Americans, it does disproportionately affect children and those in rural areas.",
      "According to Feeding America\u2019s stats, nine out of the 10 U.S. counties experiencing the highest rates of hunger are rural.",
      "Executive director of Feeding Indiana\u2019s Hungry, Emily Weikert Bryant, tells TODAY.com that rural areas of her state will feel this loss more greatly than urban areas. Those counties rely more heavily on foods acquired through USDA programs as there are fewer opportunities for retail donation.",
      "\u201cThe cost of solving rural hunger is significantly higher,\u201d Hall says. \u201cIt involves transporting smaller quantities of food over much larger distances to reach smaller rural communities.\u201d",
      "So, what now?",
      "Several food banks we spoke with say part of their mitigation strategy is to speak with their local elected officials to make sure the policymakers understand the impact of the decisions being made. Many are hopeful that these conversations will lead to reversals or other decisions to course-correct the funding cuts.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t someone far away. This is someone next door. This is a colleague, right? This is potentially a customer. This is a friend and a neighbor,\u201d Mantz says. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that if you\u2019re reading this story, we\u2019re taking care of someone you know \u2014 and proudly.\u201d",
      "Almost everyone we spoke with across the country said an ideal future includes a strong bipartisan farm bill, which they say they\u2019ve been waiting on for years.",
      "\u201cAnd it needs to include that they have these strong investments in agriculture and nutrition programs like SNAP and like TEFAP,\u201d Geiger says.",
      "Hall also mentioned a bipartisan bill as an important next step here.",
      "Food banks are already stretched, and making cuts like these is \u201cnot the way to go,\u201d Geiger says, calling these programs and SNAP \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cfunctional society.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cI think people underestimate how quickly we can be those people in line that we serve.\u201d"

      "A federal judge in Texas issued an order Wednesday temporarily blocking the Trump administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people held in a south Texas immigration detention center without due process. A second federal judge in New York said in a hearing that he planned a similar order applying to migrants held in the Southern District of New York.",
      "In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., in Brownsville, blocked the removal of any person held in El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, who could be subject to President Donald Trump\u2019s proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime  deportation law.",
      "District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in the Southern District of New York said he would issue a temporary restraining order Wednesday blocking the Trump administration from deporting without a proper notice and hearing any Venezuelan migrants the administration has said are removable under the act.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on both cases.",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act last month after declaring the Venezuela gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people, without immigration hearings, alleging that they are members of the gang. Many have ended up in a mega-prison in El Salvador known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse.",
      "The judges made their decisions in separate habeas petitions filed, in Texas, by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas, and in New York by the ACLU Foundation. They follow the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision Monday, allowing the Trump administration to deport men it alleges are members of the Tren de Aragua gang under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The nation\u2019s highest court ruled that the original lawsuit, filed in Washington, should have been filed in the state where the plaintiffs were detained. It also ruled that the plaintiffs should be allowed to challenge their detentions and whether the Alien Enemies Act is being lawfully applied to them.",
      "The ACLU's lawsuit in Texas was filed on behalf of three Venezuelans who are being held at the El Valle Detention Center. Rodriguez specifically blocked the removals of those plaintiffs, identified in the lawsuit as W.G.H, J.G.G. and J.A.V.",

      "The judge also blocked any transportation or relocation of \"such persons\" outside of Willacy and Cameron counties in Texas without a court order. The order is in effect until 5 p.m., April 23.",
      "Rodriguez scheduled a hearing at 1:30 p.m. Friday to consider whether to extend the temporary restraining order or issue other forms of emergency relief.",
      "He said he issued the order preventing their removal so that the plaintiffs could develop \"a fuller record\" for the court as it considers their request for a preliminary injunction and other relief. He also said he issued the order \"to prevent the immediate and irreparable injury that may occur with the immediate removal of any Venezuelan\" immigrant who may be subject to the president's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In the New York case brought by two Venezuelans, Hellerstein said Wednesday that he would issue an order temporarily blocking the deportations of individuals in the jurisdiction of the Southern District under the Alien Enemies Act.",

      "\u201cGiven the history, it seems they need to be protected and given the opportunity before they are deported,\u201d Hellerstein said",
      "The government said Hellerstein\u2019s order would apply to less than 10 people in the district.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, not used since World War II, allows the president to detain noncitizens in wartime and remove them when the country is under invasion or experiencing \"predatory incursion.\" The law was most notably when people of Japanese descent in the U.S. were rounded up and held in internment camps; the government also held people of German and Italian descent.",
      "The Supreme Court decision left various legal questions about the use of the Alien Enemies Act undecided, including whether the Trump administration can invoke it against gang members.",

The Supreme Court's decision lifted that order.",

      "The legislation, fast-tracked through parliament in March, prohibits events depicting homosexuality to those under the age of 18 and has drawn comparisons to Russia\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies. It comes as Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration is increasingly accused of democratic backsliding ahead of national elections next year.",
      "The weekly protests in Budapest have persisted, and on Tuesday, demonstrators filled the Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge over the Danube, demanding the withdrawal of the law. Some planned to remain on the bridge throughout the night and said there were plans to shut down all five central Danube bridges.",
      "No violence was immediately reported.",
      "The law makes it an offense to hold or attend events such as Pride, which some legal experts and human rights groups say is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest crackdown on Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ community and an arbitrary restriction on the right to assembly.",
      "Vikt\u00f3ria Vajda, one of the protesters, said the time for trying to find common ground with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government \u201chas passed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up for the rights of minorities and for our own fundamental rights, then who will when they come for us?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where we have to stand up and say, \u2018No more\u2019.\u201d",
      "The protests have defied police orders to disperse from bridges and main thoroughfares in Budapest. And in a rare instance of a street protest outside the Hungarian capital, several hundred demonstrators in the eastern city of Miskolc also protested on Tuesday against the law.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who critics say has eroded Hungary\u2019s democracy and overseen widespread corruption, has in recent years taken aim at the country\u2019s LGBTQ community, prohibiting same-sex adoption and \u2014 in a 2021 \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 banning any LGBTQ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to those under 18.",
      "As part of the new law, authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify those who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as the popular Budapest Pride, which draws tens of thousands each year \u2014 and can issue fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($545).",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is pausing his tariffs plan for 90 days on 75 trading partners who did not retaliate in the hours after it went into effect.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.",
      "In a post on X just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the U.S.  to \u201cdiscuss\u201d some of the issues he had raised.",
      "But the pause didn\u2019t apply to China, which has retaliated -- with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for that country to\u00a0125%, effective immediately.",
      "\u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "But the trade war isn\u2019t exactly over, and the pause didn\u2019t return the world back to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain in place \u2014 including for some products from Canada and Mexico.",
      "It was not immediately clear which countries would be covered by the pause; the White House would not say. Earlier Wednesday the E.U. voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but those aren\u2019t set to take effect until next week.",
      "And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain in place, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said \u2014 while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind \u2014 he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans \u201cBE COOL\u201d in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago the tariffs could be permanent.",
      "\u201cI did a 90 day pause for the people that didn\u2019t retaliate, because I told them, \u2018If you retaliate, we\u2019re going to double it.\u2019\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we\u2019ll see how it all works out. I think it\u2019s going to work out amazing.\u201d",
      "But markets have been in stunning turmoil -\u2014 major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.",
      "When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet on Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump\u2019s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed up more than 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%.",
      "Borrowing costs, which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect, also eased slightly, though not substantially as some investors may fear a lingering fallout from the tariffs episode.",
      "Borrowing costs \u2014 which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect \u2014 also eased slightly, though not substantially as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.",
      "Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for\u00a0U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2  \u2014 when he unveiled the plan -- \u201cliberation day,\u201d saying it would end decades of the U.S. being \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other countries.",
      "The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had until Wednesday doubled down, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the U.S. and fill the nation\u2019s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the U.S. and less revenue being generated.",
      "After the news, the Treasury secretary sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries into coming to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the U.S. was going to go.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear how successful the U.S. will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump\u2019s on-again off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, Trump had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before walking most of them back.",
      "And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump\u2019s\u00a0 pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the U.S. each year.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.",
      "U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White house is downplaying that risk.",
      "\u201cWhat I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood the world with cheap exports model,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted to X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: \u201cThe world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.\u201d"

      "A Chicago man was arrested last week and charged for a series of sex crimes that took place over the course of three years.",
      "Chakib Mansour Khodja, 36, was slapped with 16 felony counts and two misdemeanors for kidnapping, sexually assaulting or strangling five women between 2022 and 2025, the Chicago Police Department said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The victims ranged in age from 21 to 26 years old, and none had prior relationships with Khodja, according to police. Police said the incidents all took place on the North Side of Chicago.",
      "In May 2022, Khodja was waiting in the common area of his first known victim\u2019s apartment complex, court documents shared by the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office show. When the victim entered her building, Khodja allegedly pulled a black drawstring bag over her head and began to strangle her before fleeing.",
      "Later that year, Khodja allegedly forced a woman to perform oral sex on him and penetrated her multiple times in the backseat of a sedan, according to the documents. And in two separate incidents this year, Khodja threatened two victims with a knife before and while he allegedly sexually assaulted them.",
      "Officials did not immediately return a request to provide Khodja's attorney's contact information.",
      "At a press conference with police on Monday, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Eileen O\u2019Neill Burke\u00a0said his arrest marked a \"good day for Chicago.\"",
      "\u201cToday, every single woman in the city, every single man who has a wife, a mother, a daughter, a sister should all be breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d Burke\u00a0said. \"This man was a violent serial predator who literally went out hunting for his victims.\u201d",
      "Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said that detectives established the crime pattern through public and privately-own video and DNA evidence.",
      "DNA recovered from the black drawstring bag matched DNA recovered in multiple other sexual assault investigations and through a buccal swab of Khodja upon his arrest, according to the court documents. Khodja was arrested at O\u2019Hare International Airport.",
      "\"I want to acknowledge the strength and resilience of the survivors who were traumatized by these horrific crimes and actions of this individual,\" Snelling said. \"These women survived something that was horrible and terrible, and it\u2019s something that they will continue to live with throughout the rest of their days.\"",
      "Snelling also encouraged other victims or witnesses to step forward.",
      "\"We can never assume that we have located every victim that this predator has targeted,\" he said. \"We would like to know if there are more victims out there.\""

      "Gates, at the start of the episode, recalled a formative moment in his life: Looking at a photo of his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, the oldest known family member in his ancestry. From the age of 9 on, he was obsessed with family histories.",
      "\u201cThe woman who sparked this fascination also harbored my family\u2019s biggest secret,\u201d he said.",
      "Growing up, he was told Jane Gates had five children and they all had the same father. But who?",
      "The Gates family had a theory the father of Jane Gates' children was a man named Samuel Brady \u2014 which Moore proved wrong in the episode. Though Gates and his relatives did have one element correct: The father of at least one of Jane\u2019s children was a wealthy white landowner.",
      "Moore uncovered genetic evidence that Jane Gates\u2019 youngest child was fathered by Charles Wesley Kelley, a farmer. Kelley was killed at 35 years old by lightning while closing a window, according to a local paper.",

Kelley. And, I\u2019m sorry he was killed by laughing, it\u2019s just not what I expected.\u201d",

      "Moore also found more details about Gates' ancestry that he said shocked him even more. She was able to zoom back into Kelley\u2019s family tree to find Gates\u2019 third great-grandmother, a woman named Hannah Kelley (maiden name Stotler).",
      "Through the Stotler name, Moore learned more about Jane Gates\u2019 life in slavery. She was listed as a \u201cpiece of property\u201d in an estate record of Christian Stotler, Hannah Kelley\u2019s brother.",
      "\u201cThis is so stunning. I am just floored,\u201d Gates said. Wiping away tears, he said, \u201cThis is the most amazing discovery that I could have.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. After all this looking. This is just going to floor everybody,\" he continued.",
      "It appeared Jane Gates met Charles Kelley through his uncle, Christian Stotler. Stotler freed Jane Gates after three years, but indicated that her sons should be sold, though not out of state.",
      "\u201cBoy, that\u2019s cold. He was freeing the mother but keeping her sons in bondage,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat\u2019s cold and cruel. I would have been devastated.\u201d",
      "When Stotler died, Jane Gates and her two sons were sold to none other than Samuel Dunlap Brady, whom the Gates family initially believed to be the father of Jane Gates\u2019 children. Her sons remained in slavery while she was eventually freed.",
      "\u201cThey were close, they just didn\u2019t get it right,\u201d said Gates. \u201cThis is astonishing.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have a great family tree but the box next to Jane Gates was empty. All we knew was that he was white. If something like this is in the atmosphere of your family, you become obsessed with it,\" he continued.",
      "\"Every time there was a family gathering, people would argue. They always picked the richest or smartest white people in Cumberland, Maryland as the candidate,\" he continued.",

      "\u201cYou two were looking a little bit close, a little bit less like brother and sister and more like \u2014 you were looking at her, at times, the way the directions in the script probably told Charlie to look at Marsha,\u201d he continued.",

      "Williams said there was always chemistry with McCormick.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of like on-again, off-again with Maureen and I throughout the years. There was always a little dance being played that was broken up by hiatus,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said that he tried not to let his emotions get in the way of the job he and McCormick had to do on the show.",
      "\u201cWhen she was pretending to have be affectionate with other guys and going out on dates and stuff, I liked to just stay out of the way and let her do her job and focus on and concentrate until an episode that called for us to be sitting next to one another,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Knight also wondered if Williams made a point to be on the set when McCormick had a scene with someone like Nicholas Hammond, who played Doug in the episode.",

Because I am such a gamer, I know how important alliances are and being aware that if you\u2019re not in the conversation, they\u2019re talking about you and just keeping those mental notes. But then playing this game that we\u2019ve never seen on TV before, never have done it, and things are being thrown at us \u2014 it was nerve-wracking.",
      "I\u2019m not a good liar in real life at all. I hate lying and that\u2019s what I was nervous about. But when you put a million dollars in front of me, I will do whatever it takes. I\u2019m going to be a whole different person when I lie.",
      "I tried to play as true to myself as I could.

That\u2019s who I am, but now there\u2019s a lot on the line.",
      "You\u2019ve got to lie, you\u2019ve got to send some friends home that mean a lot and that definitely ate me alive. I really struggled with that, but at the end of the day, I just kept reminding myself how important this is for me and my family.",
      "I was surprised I had a poker face! People have told me that they could read the expressions on my face really well, so I was shocked by that.",
      "I\u2019m a very intuitive person, I\u2019ve always been that way since I was a kid, and I really lean into it and trust it.",
      "When I was sitting in the room and knowing that someone was going to get a clue about me, I just said a prayer and two things popped in my head. My middle name being Lydia, and my sisters \u2014 it just kept coming to me. I don\u2019t know what it was, it could\u2019ve been my brothers, you know? Something was telling me it\u2019s my sisters.",

      "Same thing with Corey, I kept my alliance close because I got to know them as people and I got to see how they lied, when they got nervous, or what they were really thinking. I built that bond with them to hopefully take me to the end but also do what it takes to win. Knowing that he knew deep down I was the millionaire, I think it\u2019s just because I really got to know them on a different level, and it helped me in the end.",
      "Yes, I actually had an alliance with almost every single person there with maybe the exception of Sydnee. We all still keep in touch and talk a lot with each other. We are very bonded; we did this experience together and it\u2019s beautiful. Even though things have come out about each other, we still remember we played the game and we still really care about each other."

      "\"I think that MS doesn't define me, but it has absolutely shaped me into somebody that I wouldn't want to know without the experience,\" she added. \"Of course, I would love to not struggle in my body. I would love to not have a disability. I would love to be able to participate in my life the way I would choose to, but the way that I look at the world, and the way that I feel about people, I don't know if it would be the same without this.\"",
      "Applegate, who shared in 2021 that she had been\u00a0diagnosed with MS, is in a different place.",
      "\"I am defined by it right now,\" she said. \"I'm 3 \u00bd years in. I have days where I can't even walk to the bathroom, so I am defined by it. I'm angry at it still, and there's a lot of us out there who are newly diagnosed that are not quite ready to accept this reality. I keep thinking that I'm just going to wake up from this nightmare, and it's just going to be over.\"",
      "The \"Anchorman\" star was blunt in expressing how MS has worn her down, but that there is no \"right\" way to live with the disease.",
      "\"I want to do these things and I can't, and it feels like I'm getting worse,\" she said. \"And that's disheartening. But then there's like this voice inside of me that is like, 'You've got to believe in a miracle. You've got to believe in another side of this.'",
      "\"That's just kind of where I'm at right now, which is not very inspiring to anyone,\" she continued. \"If someone listening to me goes, 'Oh my God, I feel that way, and I feel like I'm not doing it right.' There is no doing MS right.\"",
      "\"No, there's not,\" Sigler agreed.",

And by the time I got home, I was like, 'I can't move anymore.' And that's, that's the stuff that makes me (say) that I can't accept it yet because I'm mad still.\"",

      "\"It would all happen so quickly \u2014 from my first symptoms, which were very mild,\" she continued. \"There was some tingling in my toes, to five months later, from my knees down. I can't feel, and it hurts, and it's awful, and it's like a 24/7 thing now. I had to protect myself by saying, 'Hey, this is what's going on. Please just let me be.'\"",

      "Anecdotally, these songs maybe do have healing powers. The other day, after receiving disappointing news, I put in my headphones and went for a walk. Instead of blasting my usual playlist of Taylor Swift and Ren\u00e9e Rapp, I reached for a 2010s playlist, hoping some carefree hits would cheer me up.",
      "And you know what? It worked. While \"recession pop\" may be the nickname for music released during a recent economic downturn, there is no mood deficit involved here.",
      "What is 'recession pop'?",
      "Recession pop refers to the slew of hits that dominated the charts during the global financial crisis, which was from late 2007 to 2009.",
      "As the stock market plummeted, pop artists released cheery songs with positive and upbeat lyrics, focused on living in the moment and partying. The melodies were catchy, punctuated by inspiring choruses.",
      "\"Throughout the history of popular music, folks have always looked to music for escapism at tough times and for release during stressful moments,\u201d Bill Werde, director of Bandier Music Business Program at Syracuse University, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just usually happy, escapist, catchy tunes that people find easy to sing along to, easy to dance to, easy to party to \u2014 all in the service of helping them escape their troubles,\u201d he adds.",
      "Some prime examples of recession pop are \u201cTik ToK\u201d by Kesha  (2010) , \u201cDJ Got Us Fallin\u2019 In Love\u201d by Usher (2010), \u201cParty in the USA\u201d by Miley Cyrus (2009), \u201cClub Can\u2019t Handle Me\u201d by Flo Rida (2010), \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d  by the Black Eyed Peas (2009) and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d by Rihanna (2007).",

      "Why is 'recession pop' making a comeback?",
      "The comeback is twofold. Millennials who grew up with this music appear to be reaching for the music during another time of economic instability and recession fears.",
      "As one TikToker said, \u201cIf we can\u2019t afford eggs we might as well do it while dancing.\"",
      "\u201cStock markets crashing but at least we got this banger,\u201d another said in a video set to Lady Gaga's new \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d",
      "Werde believes that the return of these dance pop anthems comes down to the political climate of the country.",
      "\u201cWe are in one of the most polarized moments in American history,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while some people might think that that would show up as political music, angry music, that\u2019s just not what we\u2019ve seen. Looking at the history of the charts, in fact, the darker and tougher things get, generally, the dancier, the more escapist our pop music becomes.\u201d",
      "He notes past examples to prove his point, like the songs that topped the charts during the Vietnam War. Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d (which Werde calls \u201cthe all time greatest politically conscious songs ever released\u201d) peaked at No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s charts in 1971.",
      "\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s at No. 1, it\u2019s a Temptations song, \u2018Just My Imagination.\u2019 If you look at what\u2019s at No. 3, it\u2019s Three Dog Night\u2019s \u2018Joy to the World.\u2019 And then if you look at what\u2019s rounding out the Top 10, it\u2019s Tom Jones, the Partridge Family, and Paul McCartney. It\u2019s kind of always been like this. I think sometimes we rewrite history in our minds, but the truth is, it is very common that the darkest, most divisive times in history, our pop charts often seem the lightest,\" he says.",
      "Recession pop is also having a moment because, coincidentally, artists who were big during the Great Recession are returning with new music, like Kesha, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.",
      "As one X user summarized, \u201cThe economy is collapsing. Therefore as it is written, Kesha returns as the queen of recession pop.\u201d",
      "Werde says Lady Gaga in particularly has been \u201creally genius in understanding the pulse of culture,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s notable that she has chosen this moment to return to form largely of the Gaga of that period.\u201d",
      "Some social media users are noting the March release of \u201cSunrise on the Reaping\u201d by Suzanne Collins as another uncanny parallel between now and the Great Recession since Collins released the original \u201cHunger Games\u201d trilogy from 2008 to 2010.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re heading towards a recession, Kesha just dropped an absolute banger, I\u2019m obsessed with a Ryan Murphy show featuring a broadway diva and there\u2019s a new Hunger Games book\u2026.2010\u2019s here we come!\u201d one X user tweeted.",
      "Moving forward into 2025 and beyond, Werde thinks what's old will continue to be new again.",
      "\u201cPeople are looking a little bit more for either known artists that they can trust, maybe that bring back memories to a happier time, or they\u2019re looking for songs that have those anthem-like choruses that really speak to us. Things that help us look away (and) turn off the doom scrolling,\" he says."

      "Released in 1985, the action-adventure follows a ragtag band of kids on their quest to find a pirate's treasure while being chased by a trio of bumbling criminals hoping to beat them to it. Think Indiana Jones meets \"The Sandlot,\" with a sprinkle of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" thrown in for good measure.",
      "If it sounds Steven Spielberg-esque, it is. The Oscar-winning director conceived the story, Chris Columbus penned the screenplay and Richard Donner directed the film, which not only has become a cult classic, but was also inducted into the National Film Registry's 2017 class of films for its cultural impact and significance.",
      "While \"The Goonies\" is mainly remembered for its swashbuckling adventure, at its heart, it's a story about true friendship: both on screen and off.",
      "One that was still very much on display as original cast members Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, Kerri Green, Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano reunited to talk to TODAY's Joe Fryer about their experience filming the iconic movie, the possibility of a sequel, as well as the close bond the actors formed back in the \u201880s.",
      "\"It\u2019s like when you go through an extreme trauma,\" joked Plimpton of their longtime relationships. \"You somehow managed to survive and come out the other side. You're sort of inextricably linked to them forever and ever and ever, no matter what you do. For better or for worse,\" she laughed.",
      "\"We really were like a family,\" said Green. \"A big dysfunctional, but loving, family. It was such an important time for all of us, it was such an important period of the age that we were at. We really grew up together.\"",
      "Astin agreed, saying that during his last visit with Donner, who died in 2021 at the age of 91, the director shared with him that the reason he believed \"The Goonies\" was so successful was that the cast was \"real.\"",
      "\"Even though it\u2019s this pirate fantasy, it\u2019s real people who were really those characters, the characters become linked in the show,\" said Astin.",
      "\"And we did in life,\" he concluded.",
      "More than 40 years later, they're still tight. Like siblings returning for a family reunion, there's good-natured ribbing, catching up on life and they're happy to share their memories and thoughts about the enduring movie.",

Other memorable \"Goonies\" characters Anne Ramsey (Mama Fratelli) and John Matuszak (Sloth) passed away in 1988 and 1989, respectively.",
      "Curious to know what might have happened to the beloved \"Goonies\" characters after the credits rolled, TODAY.com joined Fryer in speaking with Astin, Davi, Feldman, Green, Pantoliano, and Plimpton, and asked them what they think their counterparts, Mikey, Jake, Mouth, Andy, Francis and Stef, would be doing today.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Sean Astin: Mikey",
      "In the film, Astin's character, Mikey, leads the Goonies on a wild adventure in search of One-Eyed Willy's hidden treasure.",
      "Where does Astin think Mikey would be today?",
      "\"(There's) no question what Mikey would be doing,\" Astin says. \"He'd be curating a museum that would take you on tours down through the caves and to the cave room, because the ship sailed away, but he would be following in his father's footsteps and curating a museum.\"",
      "Kerri Green: Andy",
      "Green plays Andy, the high school cheerleader-turned-action heroine, who falls head over heels for Brand. The pair develop a sweet teen romance, sharing a series of smooches, with the exception of one mistaken kiss (\"Brand, what happened to your braces?\") with Mikey.",
      "What does Green think Andy would be up to now?",
      "\"All I can picture is that Andy would probably still be in that tennis dress but drinking martinis,\" Green says, inspiring a chorus of laughs from the rest of the cast.",
      "Martha Plimpton: Stef",
      "As Andy's wisecracking best friend, Stef, Plimpton is the Goonies' voice of reason and often the mom figure of the motley crew.",
      "\"I feel like I'm babysitting, except I'm not getting paid,\" remains her enduring quote.",
      "Where would Stef be now?",
      "\"She and her wife would have a really nice ... fishing boat. They'd have their own deep-sea fishing tourism maybe,\" says Plimpton.",
      "\"That would be their weekend thing,\" she explains. \"The rest of the time, they'd have their nice, big fishing boat \u2014 but very sustainable, eco-friendly \u2014 and they'd have their own seafood shop or something. And she and her wife would probably have adopted a few kids.\"",
      "Corey Feldman: Mouth",
      "Of the \"Goonies\" bunch, it is Feldman's character, Mouth, who leads the gang into one mishap after another, all while dropping sarcastic one-liners (not to mention a few \"s---\" bombs) and creating hilarious mayhem from start to finish.",
      "Forty years later, would Mouth still be goading Chunk into doing the \"Truffle Shuffle\"?",
      "\"I'd be running for governor,\" says Feldman, \"in the state of Oregon.\"",
      "\"And shilling bitcoin,\" Plimpton volunteers.",
      "\"We'd be hosting fundraisers for him at the museum,\" adds Astin.",
      "Robert Davi: Jake",
      "After making his escape from prison, the opera-singing Jake Fratelli joins his brother and mother in scheming to pinch One-Eyed Willy's treasure, all while torturing his captive brother, Sloth.",
      "It's not surprising that Davi, a real-life jazz crooner, thinks that Jake would have established himself as a singer.",
      "\"Jake would put an act together of standards, and Francis would be managing him \u2014 and stealing from him,\" Davi surmises.",
      "\"But Jake is so happy singing, that we're going from club to club, and that's what Jake would be doing,\" he continues.",
      "\"And we have the map that Mama left in her shoe, in her coffin,\" Davi adds.",
      "\"You cannot leave this question open-ended,\" interrupts Feldman, laughing.",
      "\"Let me finish my moment!\" Davi laughs back before elaborating. \"Mama told Jake that the map is in the shoe, and we looked in her shoes, we didn't find it. So, we have to exhume her body,\" says Davi.",
      "With the rest of the cast utterly in stitches, Davi concludes, \"I'd be looking for the treasure while I'm singing, and (Francis is) ripping me off. ... That's what happens.\"",
      "\"What treasure? What treasure?\" Feldman asks. \"The treasure was found ... 40 years ago!\"",
      "Joe Pantoliano: Francis",
      "Pantoliano portrays the black sheep of the Fratelli crime family and says that Francis would have gone on to become an entrepreneur.",
      "\"I would be running the chain of Fratelli family restaurants,\" says Pantoliano of Francis' epilogue.",
      "\"And I would be singing at the restaurants as he's ripping me off,\" interrupts Davi.",
      "\"And I'd be supplying the restaurants with seafood,\" finishes Plimpton.",
      "With the gang still together more than four decades after their pirating adventure (theoretically, anyway), it's obvious that much like the mantra, Goonies really do never say die."

      "Just two days after the Season 3 finale of \"The White Lotus,\" the hit HBO show's creator Mike White responded to the series' composer announcing he was quitting the show due to creative differences between him and White.",
      "White, who also directed and executive produced the series, said in an interview with Howard Stern on April 8 that he didn't know what happened with Cristobal Tapia de Veer, the composer behind the music for the series since Season 1.",
      "\"I honestly don\u2019t know what happened, except now I\u2019m reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,\" White said. \"I don\u2019t think he respected me.\"",
      "\"He wants people to know that he\u2019s edgy and dark and, I don\u2019t know, like I watch reality TV,\" he continued. \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don\u2019t think I ever had a fight with him \u2014 except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes.\"",
      "White added that the thought Tapia de Veer didn't like the process of getting notes or wanting revisions from him because \"he didn't respect me.\"",
      "\"I knew he wasn\u2019t a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0to s--- on me and the show three days before the finale,\" he said. \"It was kind of a b---- move.\"",
      "Stern replied that White was the director, and that the people on his team need to go along with his vision. He's also the writer and executive producer of the series.",
      "\"Honestly, that's why it did work the first couple of seasons, because we did go through the process,\" White said. \"But by the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys, and I don't know, he had this song go viral, and so he just did not want to go through the process anymore. He didn't want to get notes from me.\"",
      "\"He would just always look at me, like he always had this, like, contemptuous smirk on his face, and whenever he was dealing with me because I just think he thought I was just a chimp or something,\" he continued.",
      "White said Tapia de Veer was \"definitely making a big deal out of just a creative difference of opinion,\" and added that he thought the composer was \"very talented.\"",

      "\"He just didn't respect me,\u00a0I guess, so have fun doing whatever you're doing next,\" he added. \"I don't know, onwards for me.\"",
      "Just days before the finale aired on April 6, Tapia de Veer told The New York Times that he wouldn't be returning for Season 4 of \"The White Lotus\" after experiencing creative differences with the show's team.",
      "\"I announced to the team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving. I didn\u2019t tell Mike for various reasons; I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock and whatever,\" Tapia de Veer said. \"Except I told the whole editorial team and music editor and producer and all that, but I didn\u2019t think that they were going to tell him. At some point he heard about that.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer said there had been disagreements with the music since Season 1 of the show aired in 2021, and that he had not been given any direction for the theme song for Season 3.",
      "\"Enlightenment,\" the Season 3 theme, was a departure from the beloved tracks from previous seasons -- leaving viewers without the iconic vocals that devoted fans came to love in Season 2.",
      "\"I have, like, over 20 versions of that theme, with and without the ooh-loo-loo-loos. But of course, in the 1:45 titles that\u2019s allowed, there\u2019s nothing from the other ones,\" he said. \"That was kind of a risk, but we never talked about that. I don\u2019t think everybody was really aware of how attached people were to the ooh-loo-loo-loos.\"",
      "When the first episode of the new season aired in February, Tapia de Veer said he began getting calls for a statement about the new theme song.",
      "\"People are furious about the change of the theme, and I thought that was interesting,\" he said. \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy about that.\"",
      "\"I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything. So I just\u00a0uploaded that to my YouTube,\" he added, referring to a longer version of the song he posted on March 19.",
      "While the backlash to the new theme song was immediate, as the season continued, the anger directed toward Tapia de Veer subsided, he said.",
      "\"At one point, people were like insulting me and sending me horrible things. And then I started seeing these videos: \u2018You know what, I used to hate the theme but now I\u2019m kind of dancing to it.\u2019 It\u2019s like they\u2019re transformed,\" he said. \"I was really excited about that.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer reflected on his choice to leave the 15-time Emmy award-winning show.",

Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn\u2019t give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did\u00a0this, you know \u2014 did those Emmys, people going crazy,\" he said.",
      "He added that he was happy with the risks he took for the series' music.",
      "\"That is the main thing that I\u2019m most happy about \u2014 it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn\u2019t have that many allies in there,\" he said.",
      "\"I treasure that more than something else I did that was just a success, and it works and that\u2019s that, with less struggle,\" he continued. \"This was a good struggle.\""

      "But when Tanya connects with Greg (Jon Gries), an unexpected romantic interest whom she eventually goes on to marry, she focuses more on her new relationship than Belinda.",
      "Though Belinda goes the extra mile for Tanya, going so far as to offer emotional support as she grieves her mother\u2019s death, Tanya reneges on her promise to invest in the business.",
      "The season ends with Belinda waving at the boat carrying Tanya away from the resort, looking bereft.",
      "What happened between Belinda and Pornchai in Season 3?",
      "Belinda finds herself in Thailand in Season 3 of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d as a participant in a months-long wellness exchange program. She's meant to learn the practices at the spa in the Thailand resort to bring them back to Maui, and teach her own techniques to the estheticians local to the Koh Samui resort.",
      "Belinda and Pornchai \u2014 who works at the Koh Samui resort spa \u2014 quickly fall for each other. Amid their flirtation, they float the idea of opening a spa together.Yet she, too, backpedals on this commitment, just as Tanya once did to her, when she comes into money.",
      "Here's how. In Season 2, Greg plotted to have Tanya murdered so he could inherit her fortune. When Belinda sees Greg in Thailand going by the name Gary, she does some Googling, and puts the pieces together. Greg offers her money in exchange for her silence. Belinda\u2019s son Zion negotiates the sum up from $100,000 to $5 million.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be virtuous and have certain kinds of ideals when you have no money and don\u2019t have to really put your money where your mouth is. It\u2019s one thing to be, \u2018oh yeah, I\u2019m gonna do this spa for women,\u2019 whatever her sort of fantasy was \u2014 but she needs someone to bankroll it,\u201d he said on\u00a0\u201cThe White Lotus Official Podcast.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat (choice to have her leave Pornchai behind) was actually an anchoring idea, that she would go and have this kind of Stella-gets-her-groove-back kind of thing with somebody there and is maybe fantasizing about maybe starting a business with this person, and then this windfall comes and it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m outta here.

      "\u201cI think there\u2019s more grief on Belinda\u2019s part than perhaps Tanya\u2019s part,\u201d she says. \u201cTanya\u2019s about to go get d\u2014. So she\u2019s like, \u2018Bye girl. I gotta go.\u2019 Belinda\u2019s a little bit more heartbroken \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t say no. She\u2019s just like, \u2018Right now, I have to get my bearings \u2026\u2019 And I do think that maybe she\u2019d circle back,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think if they look at it closely, you\u2019ll see she\u2019s departing with kindness. She reiterates multiple times \u2026 some things have changed and she just needs to wrap her head around those things, because her life just got really big,\u201d she said.",
      "Rothwell also told Variety that Belinda never led Pornchai on as much as Tanya led Belinda on.",
      "\"If people rewatch this season, she never agrees to go into business with Pornchai; she\u2019s just considering it. Which I think is a subtle but massive difference from Season 1, where you have Tanya being like, 'Yes, let\u2019s do it. Give me the papers. Show me your business plan.'She doesn\u2019t lead him on. Pornchai was definitely more into Belinda and the idea than Belinda was,\" she said.",
      "What does it all mean?",
      "It's a bittersweet full circle moment. In Season 1, Tanya leaves the door open with Belinda. \"I\u2019m going to call you,\" she says. This, perhaps, is Tanya's roundabout way of making good on the promise. The $5 million Belinda now has was once Tanya\u2019s, after all.",
      "Belinda's newfound freedom underlines another theme the \"White Lotus\" is interested in: The gap between the haves and the have-nots, and hotel staff and employees. Belinda, who was so long in the \"staff\" category, gets to experience how it feels to have money, and becomes cold in the process.",
      "There are other telling parallels between Belinda and Tanya. Both women gravitated toward what they did not originally have. Tanya had money, but leaves the hotel to chase love with Greg; Belinda had the potential for love with Pornchai, but leaves the hotel to truly experience what it's like to have money.",
      "Of course, none of this would have been possible without Greg, the most self-serving character of them all. He chooses to be with Tanya in Season 1, and to give Belinda her hush money in Season 3. This twisted, self-interested character \u2014 protecting his health in Season 1, wealth in Season 2 and freedom in Season 3.",
      "The final shots collapse the parallel between Belinda and Tanya. Tanya died on a boat in Season 2; the show ends with Belinda on a boat. It's almost like Belinda is picking up right where Tanya left off."

      "David\u2019s sister, Jaymes Foster, is Parker\u2019s mother.",
      "Aiken and his best friend, Jaymes, welcomed Parker in August 2008. Although the two have never had a romantic relationship \u2014 Aiken came out as gay shortly after Parker\u2019s birth \u2014 they decided to raise a child together.",
      "\u201cNo matter what the situation you\u2019re in, if you\u2019re raised in a loving environment, that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d Aiken shared with People that year.",
      "Although Aiken and Jaymes have largely kept Parker out of the public eye, they allowed the teen to make his television debut on Celebrity Family Feud at the age of 15 in 2024.",
      "\u201cI appreciate that he\u2019s been able to have a normal \u2014 or as close to a normal \u2014 childhood, as he could,\u201d Aiken told E! News after Parker\u2019s appearance on the show.",

      "Last year, Aiken reflected on the similarities and differences between himself and Parker during an appearance on the Adam Carolla Show. He noted that early on, Parker\u2019s behavior mirrored his own, but as Parker hit puberty, differences began to emerge, particularly in how they handle conflict and anger.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s straight,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cSo the way he was raised obviously has nothing to do with his sexual orientation. It\u2019s been interesting to me to see what is nature versus nurture \u2014 because so much of him is nature.\u201d"

      "The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest tariff increase is a \u201cmistake upon another mistake,\u201d China\u2019s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement, adding that the world\u2019s two biggest economies should \u201cresolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.\u201d",
      "The effect of China\u2019s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S.",

      "The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.",
      "China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.",
      "Hollywood movies",
      "China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world\u2019s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.",

There were no Hollywood films among China\u2019s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.",
      "U.S. services sector and intellectual property",
      "The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.",
      "U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China\u2019s State Council released Wednesday.",
      "China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.",
      "The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.",
      "Fentanyl cooperation",
      "China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.",
      "But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "Subianto spoke before getting on a flight to Abu Dhabi, the first stop in a weeklong tour of the Middle East that also includes stops in Turkey, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan. He said he would consult on the planned evacuations with those countries, some of which have also accepted Palestinians for humanitarian reasons.",
      "He added that other countries have called on Indonesia to increase its role in seeking a resolution to the conflict in Gaza. The world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation has long been a strong supporter of the Palestinians.",
      "\u201cThis is something complicated; it\u2019s not easy, but I think it encourages the Indonesian government to play a more active role,\u201d Subianto said."

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 04:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dispatched his close friend Kirill Dmitriev to Washington, while conscripting 160,000 new troops and bombing Kharkiv.",
    "story": [
      "To the casual observer, Russia seems to be marching in two opposite directions.",
      "President Vladimir Putin sent one of his close allies, Kirill Dmitriev, to Washington this week for diplomatic talks, the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "At the same time, Putin ordered the mobilization of 160,000 troops, his largest in 14 years, as his drones continue their nightly bombardment of Ukrainian civilians and he plans a spring offensive \u2014 if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to be believed.",
      "But these twin approaches perfectly illustrate Russia\u2019s strategy, according to some Western foreign policy specialists. They say that Putin is slow-walking talks with President Donald Trump so he can press his battlefield advance in Ukraine, while gambling on achieving normalized relations with a friendly White House.",
      "Putin \u201cthinks that time is on his side, and by dragging things out he\u2019ll put himself in an even better position to negotiate,\u201d said Sergey Radchenko, a Soviet-born Cold War historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Having once promised to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, Trump has found the reality to be far thornier.",
      "His team has tried to broker a ceasefire, but so far even a partial or temporary truce has been blocked by the Russians. Putin and his envoys have said they will only accept a truce if Ukraine agrees to extreme conditions tantamount to surrender and subjugation.",
      "Many Western officials and experts say Russia knows these cannot be accepted.",
      "\u201cPutin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,\u201d British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters Friday at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels. \u201cWe see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",
      "That frustration has been felt in the White House, which under Trump has taken a far friendlier approach toward the Kremlin than previous administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday he was \u201cpissed off\u201d when Putin reiterated his view that Zelenskyy should be ousted. Trump\u2019s inner circle is advising him not to hold a call with Putin until he commits to a ceasefire, two administration officials told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Familiar envoy",
      "This growing dissatisfaction explains why Moscow dispatched Dmitriev, according to Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst on Russia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels.",
      "\u201cDmitriev has direct access to Putin; in the Russian system, this is the most important thing a negotiator can have,\u201d Ignatov said. He also \u201chas his own connections in the United States.\u201d",
      "Dmitriev, 49, was born in Kyiv when it was part of the Soviet Union and heads the Russian sovereign wealth fund responsible for investing and growing the country's cash pile. He has a close relationship with Putin, who in February appointed him special envoy on international economic investment.",
      "Dmitriev studied at Stanford and got his MBA at Harvard before working for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co.",
      "After meeting with Trump\u2019s officials, he did a round of broadcast interviews in which he talked up normalizing relations with Washington, Arctic cooperation and a minerals deal. He even said the Kremlin could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plan to put humans on Mars. Ukraine was mentioned in passing, but he did not mention it in his social-media summary of the trip.",
      "\u201cWithout doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our relations,\u201d he told journalists in Washington. \u201cA series of meetings will still be needed for us to resolve all our differences. But the main thing we see is a positive, constructive attitude.\u201d",
      "The significance of Dmitriev\u2019s visit may lie in the fact he is not a career diplomat.",
      "\u201cHis apparent closeness to Putin makes him more than just a messenger,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a think tank. \u201cHe appears to be a person who can really engage in bargaining and compromise.\u201d",
      "Asked about Dmitriev\u2019s\u00a0trip, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "Pressing ahead",
      "But, to be clear, Dmitriev's main task is clearly to re-establish links with Washington \u2014 rather than signal any drawdown in Ukraine ambitions, according to experts such as Robert Hamilton, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now head of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "Dmitriev's mission \u201csignals that the Kremlin is interested in broadening the discussions with the U.S. and steering them away from Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhat the Kremlin actually seeks is to sideline the Ukraine issue and pursue a broader reset with the U.S. that leaves Ukraine and Europe out of the process and frees Russia to continue its war.\u201d",
      "Some saw evidence of that this week in Putin\u2019s announcement that the annual spring conscription draft would take on 160,000 recruits, the largest in 14 years.",
      "\u201cA clear signal it wants peace (not!)\u201d Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine\u2019s former economics minister, wrote on X.",
      "Some experts point out the draft is only slightly higher than in previous years, and by law the recruits are barred from participating in what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. But it is nonetheless a symptom of Russia's growing militarization, a shift that has seen the entire economy retooled toward its war effort.",
      "In the short term, there are few signs Russia is slowing its war.",
      "One drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv late Thursday killed five people and injured more than 30 others, officials said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy told the French newspaper La Figaro last week he believes Putin is preparing a spring offensive.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cceasefire intentions are, as far as I can discern, nonexistent,\u201d Baev added. \u201cDmitriev is most probably sent in order to wriggle out of a tight corner.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.",
      "In a post on X just before 1:30 p.m., Trump wrote that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners did not retaliate and have reached out to the U.S.  to \u201cdiscuss\u201d some of the issues he had raised.",
      "But the pause didn\u2019t apply to China, which has retaliated -- with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for that country to\u00a0125%, effective immediately.",
      "\u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "But the trade war isn\u2019t exactly over, and the pause didn\u2019t return the world back to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain in place \u2014 including for some products from Canada and Mexico.",
      "It was not immediately clear which countries would be covered by the pause; the White House would not say. Earlier Wednesday the E.U. voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but those aren\u2019t set to take effect until next week.",
      "And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain in place, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said \u2014 while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind \u2014 he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans \u201cBE COOL\u201d in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago the tariffs could be permanent.",
      "\u201cI did a 90 day pause for the people that didn\u2019t retaliate, because I told them, \u2018If you retaliate, we\u2019re going to double it.\u2019\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we\u2019ll see how it all works out. I think it\u2019s going to work out amazing.\u201d",
      "But markets have been in stunning turmoil -\u2014 major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.",
      "When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet on Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump\u2019s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed up more than 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%.",
      "Borrowing costs, which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect, also eased slightly, though not substantially as some investors may fear a lingering fallout from the tariffs episode.",
      "Borrowing costs \u2014 which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect \u2014 also eased slightly, though not substantially as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.",
      "Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for\u00a0U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2  \u2014 when he unveiled the plan -- \u201cliberation day,\u201d saying it would end decades of the U.S. being \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other countries.",
      "The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had until Wednesday doubled down, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the U.S. and fill the nation\u2019s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the U.S. and less revenue being generated.",
      "After the news, the Treasury secretary sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries into coming to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the U.S. was going to go.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear how successful the U.S. will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump\u2019s on-again off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, Trump had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before walking most of them back.",
      "And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump\u2019s\u00a0 pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the U.S. each year.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.",
      "U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White house is downplaying that risk.",
      "\u201cWhat I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood the world with cheap exports model,\u201d Bessent said.",

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Thousands of protesters rallied for the fourth week in Hungary\u2019s capital on Tuesday, denouncing a new law passed by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist government banning LGBTQ Pride events.",
      "The legislation, fast-tracked through parliament in March, prohibits events depicting homosexuality to those under the age of 18 and has drawn comparisons to Russia\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies. It comes as Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration is increasingly accused of democratic backsliding ahead of national elections next year.",
      "The weekly protests in Budapest have persisted, and on Tuesday, demonstrators filled the Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge over the Danube, demanding the withdrawal of the law. Some planned to remain on the bridge throughout the night and said there were plans to shut down all five central Danube bridges.",
      "No violence was immediately reported.",
      "The law makes it an offense to hold or attend events such as Pride, which some legal experts and human rights groups say is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest crackdown on Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ community and an arbitrary restriction on the right to assembly.",
      "Vikt\u00f3ria Vajda, one of the protesters, said the time for trying to find common ground with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government \u201chas passed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up for the rights of minorities and for our own fundamental rights, then who will when they come for us?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where we have to stand up and say, \u2018No more\u2019.\u201d",
      "The protests have defied police orders to disperse from bridges and main thoroughfares in Budapest. And in a rare instance of a street protest outside the Hungarian capital, several hundred demonstrators in the eastern city of Miskolc also protested on Tuesday against the law.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who critics say has eroded Hungary\u2019s democracy and overseen widespread corruption, has in recent years taken aim at the country\u2019s LGBTQ community, prohibiting same-sex adoption and \u2014 in a 2021 \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 banning any LGBTQ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to those under 18.",
      "As part of the new law, authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify those who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as the popular Budapest Pride, which draws tens of thousands each year \u2014 and can issue fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($545).",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party is pushing for a constitutional amendment next week that will codify the ban on public LGBTQ events. The Hungarian leader has also pledged to introduce new legislation that will ban demonstrators from blocking traffic on bridges and busy roads, arguing the right of assembly and expression cannot override the rights of commuters.",
      "J\u00e1nos Stummer, a member of the opposition Momentum party who was at the protest, said that while the ban on Pride was harmful to members of the LGBTQ community, the law is also about \u201cOrb\u00e1n unilaterally, arbitrarily deciding which events can be held in this country and which cannot.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government argues that it\u2019s protecting children from \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "But with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lagging in polls, critics views the legislation as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base."

      "The U.S. president has said the\u00a0tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move operations to the U.S. However, analysts and\u00a0companies\u00a0have\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0about the difficulty in setting up manufacturing in the United States.",
      "Shares of major U.S. drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences, Pfizer, Merck\u00a0and Eli Lilly\u00a0fell between 2% and 4% in premarket trading.",
      "In Europe, a basket of healthcare stocks\u00a0.SXDP\u00a0fell 5% to its lowest since October 2022, leading losses among sectoral indexes on the region-wide STOXX 600. The index was heading for its biggest one-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Trump had also\u00a0threatened\u00a0the duties on Friday after his first set of \u201creciprocal\u201d\u00a0tariffs exempted pharma products. Trump has not said when and by how much he plans to raise taxes on pharma imports.",
      "\u201cWhile the details are scant, we are strongly opposed to\u00a0tariffs on any\u00a0pharmaceuticals\u00a0-- these will likely do little to shift manufacturing back to the U.S.,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman.",
      "\u201cGiven the complexity of the pharma supply chain, we do not expect the industry to make any major changes. These current\u00a0tariffs are being pursued under emergency powers, which at worse will last until the end of the current administration and could end sooner with an act of Congress,\u201d Seigerman added.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have interconnected supply chains for medicines. The U.S. depends on medicines partly produced in Europe that bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "E.U. medical and pharmaceutical product exports to the U.S. totalled about 90 billion euros ($97 billion) in 2023, according to the latest Eurostat data.",
      "Barclays analysts said in a note last week that Europe accounted for about 80% of the U.S. trade deficit in biopharma.",
      "They highlighted companies with a high share of U.S. revenue or limited U.S. manufacturing sites as potentially more affected, such as Argenx, UCB, or Novo Nordisk.",
      "Shares of AstraZeneca, GSK, Roche, Sanofi\u00a0, and Novartis\u00a0fell between 5% and 6.5% in Europe.",
      "In contrast, companies like AstraZeneca, Roche and Sanofi could be more immune given their diverse global manufacturing network and increasing manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., Barclays\u2019 analysts said.",
      "Meanwhile, Indian pharmaceutical stocks\u00a0closed nearly 2% lower, dragging down the benchmark Nifty 50 by 0.6%.",
      "IPCA Laboratories, Glenmark Pharma\u00a0and Biocon\u00a0were the top losers by percentage on the pharma index in Mumbai, ending the trading session between 4% and 5.5% lower.",
      "India\u2019s pharma exports to the U.S. mostly comprise generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs. The U.S. accounts for a third of India\u2019s overall pharma exports."

    "summary": "The IMF said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout as President Javier Milei seeking overturn of country's old economy.",
    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country\u2019s old economic order.",
      "As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF\u2019s executive board. The board will convene in the coming days, the IMF statement said.",
      "The fund\u2019s long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina\u2019s troubled economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts. The country has received more IMF bailouts than any other.",
      "It came at a critical moment for South America\u2019s second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina\u2019s rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and burned through its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.",
      "Fears grew that if the government failed to secure an IMF loan, hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.",
      "The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina\u2019s strict foreign exchange controls, which could help convince markets of his program\u2019s sustainability. For the past six years, the capital restrictions have dissuaded investment, preventing companies from sending profits abroad and ensuring the central bank\u2019s careful management the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.",
      "Racking up 22 IMF loans since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds have been used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a fraught reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country\u2019s historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.",
      "The IMF was wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor. But over the past 16 months, fund officials have praised Milei\u2019s austerity \u2014 a diet harsher than even the fund\u2019s typical prescription.",
      "A former TV personality and self-proclaimed \u201c anarcho-capitalist,\u201d Milei came to power on a vow to shrink Argentina\u2019s bloated bureaucracy, kill spiraling inflation, open the economy to international markets and woo foreign investors after years of isolation.",
      "Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has taken his chainsaw to the state, firing tens of thousands of state employees, dissolving or downgrading a dozen ministries, gutting the education sector, cutting inflation adjustments for pensions, freezing public works projects, lifting price controls and slashing subsidies.",
      "Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina\u2019s rosy macroeconomic indicators. Retirees have been protesting weekly against low pensions, with the decrease in payments accounting for the largest share of Milei\u2019s budget cuts. Major labor unions announced a 36-hour general strike starting Wednesday in solidarity.",
      "Still, Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, a surprise that analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation, which dropped to 118% from 211% annually during his first year in office. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent the local stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.",
      "\u201cThe agreement builds on the authorities\u2019 impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation,\u201d the IMF said in announcing the agreement under a 48-month arrangement. \u201cThe program supports the next phase of Argentina\u2019s homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.\u201d",
      "It remained unclear how much money Argentina would receive up-front \u2014 a key sticking point in the most recent negotiations over the deal\u2019s details. Argentina is seeking a hefty payment upfront to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.",
      "Milei shared the IMF statement on social media platform X, attaching a photo that showed him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. \u201cVavos!\u201d he wrote \u2014 apparently misspelling \u201cVamos!\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d in his excitement."

      "The three will serve out their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama said. The presidency said the Americans left Congo Tuesday morning.",
      "The State Department said it was aware of their transfer into U.S. custody and referred questions to the Department of Justice. A DOJ spokesperson said they did not immediately have information to share.",
      "The conditions of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear. But international law experts said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will shorten their sentences.",
      "Among the three Americans was 21-year-old Marcel Malanga, son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the foiled coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who live-streamed from the palace during the attempt, was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Marcel Malanga has said his father forced him to take part.",
      "Also repatriated were Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, a friend of the younger Malanga who flew to Africa from Utah for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.",
      "The repatriation came amid efforts by Congolese authorities to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. in exchange for security support that will help the capital city of Kinshasa fight rebels in the country\u2019s conflict-hit east.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser for Africa last week confirmed the countries were in talks on the issue and said it could involve \u201cmultibillion-dollar investments.\u201d The U.S. has estimated Congo has trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, much of it untapped.",
      "\u201cThis decision is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights between the two countries,\u201d Congo\u2019s presidency said Tuesday of the repatriation.",
      "The news of their return brought joy to their families. Thompson\u2019s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told the AP that they didn\u2019t have all the details \u201cbut we\u2019re so excited to have him on American soil again.\u201d The Thompsons said they were grateful for all the support they received from the U.S. government, family and friends.",
      "Thompson\u2019s lawyer Skye Lazaro said Tuesday that she had limited information on what his status will be once he lands stateside. She said she plans to pursue all available legal avenues relating to his detention in the U.S.",
      "When the U.S. assumes custody of prisoners convicted abroad, it typically agrees to carry out a sentence of imprisonment designated by that country.",
      "Lawyers for the repatriated Americans could try to get their sentences reduced by arguing they signed their consents to the prisoner transfer treaty under duress, said Jared Genser, a U.S.-based international human rights attorney.",
      "\u201cBut it would be very hard to prevail in such a case as there would be enormous implications for other potential transfers in the future if the U.S. failed to abide by such agreements,\u201d Genser said.",
      "Dozens of others were convicted after the coup attempt, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian. Charges included terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons.",
      "The fate of the others was not immediately clear.",
      "Congo had reinstated the death penalty last year, lifting a more than 2-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks.",
      "Family members last year said the Americans slept on the floor at a high-security military prison in Kinshasa, struggling with health issues and having to pay for food and hygiene products."

      "Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, was first summoned by police last week to hear the charges against him, including violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activity.",
      "Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The U.S. said that it was \u201calarmed\u201d by Chamber\u2019s arrest and would provide consular assistance.",
      "The State Department wrote in a statement that \u201cThis case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand.

      "Thai Lawyers for Human Right said the charges stemmed from the text of the invitation to the October 2024 webinar, titled \u201cThailand\u2019s 2024 Military and Police Reshuffles: What Do They Mean?\u201d and that the charge sheet contained the Thai translation of the invitation\u2019s description of the event.",
      "Napisa also said her husband was not summoned for questioning by police before he was presented with the warrant for his arrest, as is typical in such cases.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like they wanted to deter Paul from doing his work and research, which often touches on topics like the economics of the Thai army,.\u201d she told The Associated Press over the phone.",
      "Thai law envisages 3-15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has also been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has in the past decade grown louder, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020, began openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing.",
      "The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week.",
      "But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China\u2019s national interests.",
      "NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Why is it important?",
      "In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was \u201cvital\u201d to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999.",
      "Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to \u201creclaim\u201d the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes.",
      "Visiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201ctake back the Panama Canal from China\u2019s influence.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201cwill not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal\u2019s operation or integrity,\u201d he said.",
      "China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth\u2019s remarks \u201cirresponsible.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Panama also denies Trump\u2019s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison\u2019s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "On Monday, Panama\u2019s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021.",
      "CK Hutchison\u2019s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2.",
      "Trump quickly declared victory. \u201cTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal.",
      "China\u2019s 'long-arm' jurisdiction",

      "\u201cIt represents a major victory for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, adding that is something China \u201cwould not want to happen.\u201d",
      "Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal.",

      "Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said at least 138 people were rescued from the rubble by late Tuesday morning.",
      "Among those initially rescued was former Major League Baseball pitcher Octavio Dotel, local media reported. He was taken to a hospital but did not survive, officials said.",
      "The Dominican Republic's minister of sports, Kelvin Cruz, confirmed Dotel's death on Instagram.",
      "\"We deeply regret the passing of former Major League Baseball player and Dominican Sports Immortal, Octavio Dotel. His legacy on and off the field leaves an indelible mark on the history of national baseball,\" Cruz said.",
      "Dotel played for 13 teams in his 15-year career, including the\u00a0Houston Astros, the New York Mets\u00a0and the Detroit Tigers. He won a\u00a0World Series ring in 2011\u00a0with the\u00a0St. Louis Cardinals.",
      "\"Peace to his soul and strength to his family and loved ones,\" Cruz said.",
      "Dotel's agent, Dan Horwits, said in a statement that he \"was one of a kind.\"",
      "\"His energy, positivity and zest for life were infectious to all who had the pleasure of knowing him,\" Horwits said. \"We pass along our thoughts and prayers to his entire family as well as everyone affected by the tragedy.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said another former player, left fielder Tony Blanco, who played for Washington Nationals in 2005, also died in the collapse.",
      "\"The connection between baseball and the Dominican Republic runs deep,\" Manfred said, \"and we are thinking of all the Dominican players and fans across the game today.\u201d",
      "Abinader declared three national days of mourning, which will end Thursday, mandating that the national flag be flown at half-staff.",
      "He also confirmed that Nelsy Cruz, governor of Montecristi province, was among those killed.",
      "Cruz's brother, baseball player Nelson Cruz, shared a statement on behalf of the family on his Instagram story announcing that his sister's remains \"will be on display at the Provincial Government of Montecristi\" on Tuesday afternoon and that a funeral will be held in the evening.",
      "Dominican Culture Minister Roberto \u00c1ngel Salcedo also expressed his condolences on X.",
      "\"Her death is an irreparable loss for her community and for the entire country,\" Salcedo wrote. \"Nelsy was a committed public servant, a woman of steadfast leadership, and an unwavering ally in initiatives aimed at strengthening our identity and development.\"",
      "Paulino, P\u00e9rez\u2019s manager, whose shirt was spattered with blood, told reporters at the scene that the merengue concert began shortly before midnight, with the roof collapsing almost an hour later and killing the group\u2019s saxophonist, The Associated Press reported.",
      "P\u00e9rez\u2019s daughter Zulinka P\u00e9rez said her father started to sing so rescuers could find him in the rubble, local media reported.",
      "Global music stars Juan Luis Guerra, from the Dominican Republic, Daddy Yankee, from Puerto Rico, and Marc Anthony, a New Yorker who has Puerto Rican heritage, spoke about the tragedy on their social media accounts Tuesday.",
      "All offered prayers for those affected, with Anthony sending \"a hug from a distance\" to \"my brothers and sisters from the Dominican Republic,\" and Daddy Yankee saying there are \"no words to express the sadness at seeing the tragedy that happened at Jet Set.\"",
      "Photos of the scene by local media show the building's fallen roof in pieces, crumbling cement walls and piles of debris.",
      "\"Our city wakes up to a terrible tragedy that occurred at the Jet Set nightclub. My deepest sympathy goes out to the families still waiting for news of their loved ones,\" Santo Domingo Mayor Carolina Mej\u00eda de Garrig\u00f3 wrote Tuesday morning on X."

      "With an eye toward the Trump administration\u2019s outsized tariffs\u00a0set to take effect at midnight, U.S. markets quickly reversed an early morning rally on Tuesday and closed down for a fourth-straight day.",
      "The open question for investors, economists and the public remains whether \u2014 and how \u2014 the latest installment of Trump's tariff program will affect prices for consumer goods.",
      "The situation remains fraught. The Trump administration has offered mixed signals about its willingness to negotiate the gigantic tariffs announced last week, and both Trump and China have escalated their rhetoric around what has become an all-out trade war.",
      "China now faces a cumulative tariff rate of 104% because of new trade duties Trump imposed this year, on top of levies he had already enacted during his first term. Those took effect late Tuesday.",
      "Asian and European markets rallied overnight, with U.S. stocks initially maintaining that momentum. But it ended up being a wild day for Wall Street, with the major indexes declining throughout the session. The S&P 500 swung about 7% \u2014 initially starting out strongly positive but finishing the day down 1.6%.",

    "summary": "Among the top goals for President Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with steep tariffs is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of short-term market and economic duress.",
    "story": [
      "Among the top goals for President Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with\u00a0steep tariffs\u00a0is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of\u00a0short-term market and economic duress. But in Cambodia, the Asian country hit with the highest tariff rate of any in the new trade plan, that goal is highly unlikely.",
      "While the 49% tariff rate that the Trump administration is placing on Cambodian goods will lead to an existential crisis for Cambodian factories and workers already at the low-end of global income distribution, reshoring of its manufacturing to the U.S. is not going to happen, according to a trade group that represents U.S. interests in the retail manufacturing hub.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely not going to go back to the United States,\u201d said Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, the trade association representing U.S. companies manufacturing in Cambodia. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Americans want to sit down and sew a pair of sweatpants for long hours of the day,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "Barnett said manufacturers in Cambodia are looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs, but the U.S. is not among the options. Some companies are looking to move their supply chains to Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. Other companies are moving more slowly, thinking there might be a reversal on the tariffs.",
      "Factories in Cambodia are by no means in a good position for the moment, according to Barnett, looking for ways to survive for the next few months.",
      "\u201cThe labor-intensive garment factories here in Cambodia simply cannot continue to operate with a 49% additional tariff. They can\u2019t survive and are looking for alternatives,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, at least, no new orders are being placed. \u201cThere are orders being paused. Everyone\u2019s facing uncertainty and they want to wait a bit to see how the dust settles,\u201d Barnett added.",
      "The Cambodian government is working on a number of steps to mitigate the pressure, such as fiscal policies, including tax credits.",
      "Under Armour, Rawlings Sporting Goods, Lululemon, Black & Decker, Hugo Boss, Hearth & Home, Eddie Bauer, Dollar General, Diageo, Asics, Adidas, and Bass Pro Shops are among the retail companies that import from Cambodia to North America. There is an ever wider list of items imported from garments to footwear, travel goods, bicycles, agriculture products, furniture, solar panels, tires, and kitchen cabinets.",
      "Expect a pause in executive decision-making",
      "Andrei Quinn-Barabanov, supply chain industry practice lead at Moody\u2019s, says that even if companies manufacture as cheaply as possible, relocating supply chains is a major investment.",
      "\u201cSupply chain investments are meant to be longer term and when you have tremendous uncertainty like this you are unlikely to make these decisions. Companies will wait to see what the tariff response will be from other countries, as well as nontariff restrictions they will put on U.S. companies. You will have very little executive decision making.\u201d",
      "The White House has claimed that Cambodia\u2019s tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97%, a claim disputed by the country, as well as by multiple sources of tariffs data, including the World Trade Organization. The Observatory of Economic Complexity, which also studies trade data, says some consumer products such as snacks, cosmetics, and automobiles can see much higher tariffs than the average, as high as 35%, in Cambodia. The U.S. average tariff on Cambodian goods is 2.6%.",
      "The administration has continued to argue that the return of manufacturing to the U.S. will ultimately lead to greater revenue for the U.S. \u201cIf we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs,\u201d\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cIf we\u2019re successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you\u2019re taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline.\u201d",
      "Andre C. Winters, founder and principal of supply chain consultancy and planning company, HudsonWinters,\u00a0recently told CNBC\u00a0he is doubtful that companies will bring manufacturing back to the U.S. in a hurry. \u201cThis trade war is not an incentive to come back to the United States,\u201d said Winters. \u201cCompanies will look to other countries that are being hit with lower tariffs. If I\u2019m paying 40% in Vietnam and I can get 20% tariff in another country, I\u2019ll go there, because in the end, it is still cheaper than coming back to America.\u201d",
      "Barnett said the U.S. consumer will be footing at least part of the bill, as\u00a0many companies have warned.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to push up the prices for the American consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cCambodia\u2019s been helping American families buy those back-to-school clothes at an affordable price. These tariffs are simply going to raise prices for American families and not bring manufacturing back to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Bringing manufacturing back to the United States is\u00a0not the only reason for the Trump tariffs plan, according to President Trump and his trade advisers, with reducing the nation\u2019s trade deficit and debt, and enabling tax cuts, also critical to their strategy, and that has become clear as nations begin to offer tariff concessions.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s prime minister\u00a0sent a letter to the Trump administration\u00a0in recent days outlining significant reductions in tariff rates for U.S. goods. Vietnam offered to take tariffs on U.S. imports to 0%, an offer that Trump noted, but that the Trump administration later indicated would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies.",
      "Trade deficits and \u201cnontariff cheating\u201d are as important, said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday in a CNBC interview, in rejecting the premise of the Vietnamese offer.",
      "In a comparison of trade deficits, Cambodia ranks low on the list compared to many international manufacturing nations. U.S. goods trade with Cambodia totaled an estimated $13 billion in 2024,\u00a0according to the USTR. U.S. goods exports to Cambodia in 2024 were $321.6 million, up 4.9 percent ($14.9 million) from 2023. U.S. goods imported from Cambodia totaled $12.7 billion in 2024, up 9.3 percent ($1.1 billion) from 2023. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Cambodia was $12.3 billion in 2024 and is not in the top ten of trade deficits.",
      "Trump advisors have used the term\u00a0\u201cburden sharing\u201d\u00a0to discuss the broader philosophy behind the aggressive tariffs stance and argue other countries will bear the cost of tariffs. Many economists have pointed to the risks tied to\u00a0hitting some of the poorest nations in the world\u00a0with high tariffs. Cambodia is among the 11 nations that account for a small part of the U.S. trade deficit but have exports to the U.S. representing over 10% of their GDP, according to the Center for Global Development. \u201cFor people working in the apparel industry, the conditions are\u00a0harsh, but the wages these jobs offer represent a real opportunity, particularly for women,\u201d it noted.",
      "Barnett echoed those fears, saying the tariff rates which will only increase poverty in Cambodia, lead to the loss of jobs, and further widen the trade deficit.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a panic and that\u2019s tragic because there are one million of the world\u2019s poorest people currently employed in this industry here in Cambodia, and many of them are women trying to make ends meet. Their monthly salary is around $300,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cCambodia is between a rock and a hard place.\u201d"
