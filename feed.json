      "Edmund White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Andrew Sean Greer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, remembers the first time he read Edmund White. It was the summer of 1989, he was beginning his second year at Brown University and he had just come out.",
      "Having learned that White would be teaching at Brown, he found a copy of White's celebrated coming-of-age novel, \u201cA Boy's Own Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never read anything like it \u2014 nobody had \u2014 and what strikes me looking back is the lack of shame or self-hatred or misery that imbued so many other gay male works of fiction of that time,\u201d says Greer, whose \u201cLess\u201d won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2018. \"I, of course, did not know then I was reading a truly important literary work. All I knew is I wanted to read more.",
      "\u201cReading was all we had in those days \u2014 the private, unshared experience that could help you explore your private life,\" he said. \"Ed invented so many of us.\"",
      "White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85. He left behind such widely read works as \u201cA Boy\u2019s Own Story\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Room Is Empty\u201d and a gift to countless younger writers: Validation of their lives, the discovery of themselves through the stories of others.",
      "Greer and other authors speak of White's work as more than just an influence, but as a rite of passage: \"How a queer man might begin to question all of the deeply held, deeply religious, deeply American assumptions about desire, love, and sex \u2014 who is entitled to have it, how it must be had, what it looks like,\u201d says Robert Jones Jr., whose novel above love between two enslaved men, \u201c The Prophets,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist in 2021.",
      "Jones remembers being a teenager in the 1980s when he read \u201dA Boy's Own Story.\" He found the book at a store in a gay neighborhood in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, \u201cthe safest place for a person to be openly queer in New York City,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary time for me because all the news stories about queer men revolved around AIDS and dying, and how the disease was the Christian god\u2019s vengeance against the 'sin of homosexuality,'\u201d Jones added.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that I had come across any literature that confirmed that queer men have a childhood; that my own desires were not, in fact, some aberration, but were natural; and that any suffering and loneliness I was experiencing wasn\u2019t divine retribution, but was the intention of a human-made bigotry that could be, if I had the courage and the community, confronted and perhaps defeated,\" he said.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, White published more than 25 books, including novels, memoirs, plays, biographies and \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex,\u201d a response to the 1970s bestseller \u201cThe Joy of Sex.\" He held the rare stature for a living author of having a prize named for him, the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction, as presented by the Publishing Triangle.",
      "\u201cWhite was very supportive of young writers, encouraging them to explore and expand new and individual visions,\u201d said Carol Rosenfeld, chair of the Triangle. The award was \u201cone way of honoring that support.\u201d",
      "Winners such the prize was founded, in 2006, have included \u201cThe Prophets,\u201d Myriam Gurba 's \u201cDahlia Season\u201d and Joe Okonkwo's \u201cJazz Moon.\u201d Earlier this year, the award was given to Jiaming Tang's \u201c Cinema Love,\u201d a story of gay men in rural China.",
      "Tang remembered reading \u201cA Boy's Own Story\u201d in his early 20s, and said that both the book and White were \u201cessential touchpoints in my gay coming-of-age.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe writes with intimate specificity and humor, and no other writer has captured the electric excitement and crushing loneliness that gay men experience as they come of age,\u201d Tang said. \"He\u2019s a towering figure. There\u2019d be no gay literature in America without Edmund White.\u201d",

      "HBO\u2019s new bio series \u201cChespirito: Not Really on Purpose\u201d or \u201cSin Querer Queriendo\u201d has been received with delight by many fans in the U.S. and Latin America who grew up watching Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os",
      "HBO\u2019s new biographical series \u201cChespirito: Not Really on Purpose\u201d (\u201cSin Querer Queriendo\u201d) has been received with delight by the many fans in the U.S. and Latin America who grew up watching the late Mexican comedian Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os.",
      "The eight-episode miniseries, which debuted Thursday, dramatizes the professional and personal journey of G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, who transformed comedy in Latin America and whose characters defined a generation for millions of children. Known as \u201cChespirito,\" he took his inspiration from Laurel and Hardy as well as another transcendent Mexican comedian who eventually made it to Hollywood, Cantinflas. Chespirito died in 2014 at age 85.",
      "Pablo Cruz, who plays Chespirito in the series, told The Associated Press in an interview translated from Spanish that the show is a tribute that tells \u201ca story that we know will connect with a very broad audience and give them an opportunity to further appreciate what they already admire and love.\u201d",
      "Chespirito's two most famous characters were \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d (\"The Boy from Number Eight\u201d) and \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d (\u201cThe Crimson Grasshopper\u201d). \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\" was an 8-year-old boy orphan living alone in a Mexican neighborhood with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and grayed cap. \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d was a naive superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away (despite the name, his yellow shorts and boots gave him more the look of a red bumblebee).",
      "Through his characters, Chespirito favored a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. His morning shows were a staple for preschoolers, much like \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was in the United States.",
      "The HBO series \u201cis a tribute to Chespirito\u2019s importance as one of the key figures in Mexican television and highlights the enormous impact his television programs had throughout Latin America,\u201d Fernando C\u00e1rdenas, digital manager for the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, said in a statement to the AP.",
      "The miniseries is a powerful act of cultural preservation, one that documents the impact Latinos have had on the global entertainment industry, said Sehila Mota Casper, director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation.",
      "\u201cFor so many of us, his characters weren\u2019t just entertainment,\u201d Mota Casper said. \u201cThey shaped how we understand humor, how we face challenges and how we see ourselves as Latinxs. This series honors that impact. By telling his story in this way, we help make sure the cultural histories that shaped us are seen, respected and carried forwards to future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEl Chavo\u201d proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin America and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os said he always wrote with working-class people in mind.",
      "\u201cDuring the 1970s, the program was produced to reflect the reality of working-class families in Mexico and enjoyed enormous impact in other Spanish-speaking countries because the situations portrayed in the stories were similar to those of all audiences, regardless of geographical boundaries,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said.",
      "Alberto Lammers, who grew up watching \u201cEl Chavo\u201d in Peru during the 1970s and \u201880s, was excited for the series and the childhood nostalgia it evokes. He was also excited to learn more about what was happening behind the scenes in G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os\u2019 life.",
      "\u201cIt really struck a chord with my childhood,\u201d Lammers, who now lives in California, said after finishing the first episode. \u201cIt gives heart and context to his complexity and the characters he built. It\u2019s also a very interesting look at how he became a TV personality. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes! It\u2019s a real-life telenovela!\u201d",
      "Fans also took to social media to praise the episode and their awe at the uncanny similarities between the actors and the people they are playing.",
      "For Lammers, after migrating to the U.S., \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d served as a connection to his roots even if the show wasn't based in Peru.",
      "\u201cGoing to that show to me was actually very comforting,\u201d Lammers said. \u201cIt built a sense of community across most of Latin America.\u201d",

      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,\u201d said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",
      "\u201cI was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,\u201d said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.",
      "Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a \u201cSinners\u201d display at the cultural center.",
      "The movie's introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley\u2019s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric. She was radiant even as a hologram in \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d She stole the show in Rian Johnson\u2019s star-studded \u201cKnives Out.\u201d She breezed through the Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d She was Oscar nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in \u201cBlonde. \u201d",
      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas.

      "Atlantic City police say surveillance video initially led them to a 57-year-old Pleasantville man. He was later seen on video walking through various parts of the city, trying to sell the instruments, and he eventually sold one while the other remains unaccounted for, police said, declining further comment. The man has been charged with burglary and theft.",
      "The band was set to kick off the An Evening With Heart tour at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City on Saturday, and its gear had been set up there the day prior to the show. Among the items stolen were a custom-built, purple sparkle baritone Telecaster guitar with a hand-painted headstock made for band member Nancy Wilson, and a vintage 1966 Gibson EM-50 mandolin that band member Paul Moak has played for over 25 years.",
      "\u201cThese instruments are more than just tools of our trade \u2014 they\u2019re extensions of our musical souls,\u201d Nancy Wilson said in a statement issued by the group that also offered a reward for information leading to their return. \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken, and we\u2019re asking for their safe return\u2014 no questions asked.

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors started deliberating Thursday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s New York sex crimes retrial, tasked with deciding \u2014 again \u2014 a case that encapsulated the #MeToo movement.",
      "The seven-woman, five-man jury is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape, each relating to a different accuser and a different date. In this case, the criminal sex act charge is the higher-degree felony. The jury got the case after a juror was replaced by an alternate after she couldn\u2019t come to court due to illness.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Nearly eight years ago, a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the Oscar-winning movie producer propelled the #MeToo movement. Some of those accusations later generated criminal charges and convictions in New York and California.",
      "The New York conviction from 2020 was subsequently overturned, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy and sometimes fiery questioning of Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Jessica Mann said he raped her in 2013, when she was trying to build an acting career. Miriam Haley accused him of forcibly performing oral sex on her in 2006, when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",
      "Kaja Sokola, who wasn't involved in Weinstein's first trial, told jurors that he forced oral sex on her, too, during 2006. At the time, she was a teenage fashion model trying to break into acting.",
      "\u201cThey all had dreams of pursuing careers in the defendant's world, the entertainment industry,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told jurors in her closing argument Tuesday. She contended that Weinstein let the women think he was interested in their careers when what actually interested him were their bodies, and \"he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they wanted him to or not.\u201d",

      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",

      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title.

      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "Jessie J, 37, shared the news in an Instagram video on Wednesday. \u201cI was diagnosed with early breast cancer,\u201d she said in the clip. \u201cCancer sucks in any form, but I\u2019m holding onto the word \u2018early\u2019.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic way to get a boob job. I am going to disappear for a bit after Summertime Ball to have my surgery, and I will come back with massive (expletive) and more music.\u201d",
      "The annual Summertime Ball will be held at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, June 15.",
      "She told her social media audience that she felt compelled to share her diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to be open and share it,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, because, selfishly, I do not talk about it enough. I\u2019m not processing it because I\u2019m working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I\u2019m an open book. It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much similar and worse \u2013 that\u2019s the bit that kills me.\u201d",
      "The Grammy-nominated Jessie J has long been celebrated for her robust soprano and R&B-informed pop hits, like the 2014 collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, \u201cBang Bang,\u201d and 2011's \u201cDomino.\u201d",

      "So vividly drawn is Stephen King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stephen King \u2019s first editor, Bill Thompson, once said, \u201cSteve has a movie camera in his head.\u201d",
      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Cynthia Erivo will release her sophomore solo album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- It began as it always should, with her voice.",
      "The second solo album from Cynthia Erivo, fresh off a herculean press run with the success of the first \u201cWicked\u201d film, was always meant to be \u201cvocal-focused,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. It may be the understatement of a lifetime: to know her is to know her instrument \u2014 that range, the notes few else can hit but many attempt.",
      "And Erivo's new soulful album, the evocatively titled \u201cI Forgive You,\" hits the mark.",
      "In the studio, that meant using her vocals \u201cas the pads, as the stacking,\u201d like an artist might with a guitar or piano. \u201cThe meat of each of the pieces that you listen to is the voice,\u201d she says, \u201cSo that you can hear the lyrics, you can hear the song, you can hear the emotion in it,\u201d she explains. The other instruments, too, were performed live. \"Everything you hear in there is real and tangible.\u201d",
      "For that reason \u2014 and other expressions of autonomy take across the album \u2014 she says it felt like her first. For the listener, it evokes a real feeling of intimacy.",
      "Erivo spoke to the AP about \u201cI Forgive You,\u201d life after \u201cWicked\" and the forthcoming \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d and the ways in which acting, singing and writing inform one another.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "ERIVO: This album is a collection of stories and songs that are both personal for things that are happening now, things that have happened in the past, and I think some of which I have had to forgive people for. And honestly, some of which I\u2019ve had to forgive myself for. And I loved the idea of calling it this title, because it\u2019s a simple concept, but not an easy one. And not one that we as humans are very good at, often.",
      "A part of me was feeling, like, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people had to keep repeating the words, 'I forgive you?'\u201d So even if you\u2019re finding it difficult to say this album will give you the permission to actually say the words, even if you\u2019re not quite ready.",
      "ERIVO: The concept of being a work in progress \u2014 who still gets scared of things, who still has to deal with things \u2014 that won\u2019t ever necessarily stop. It might get quiet, but that feeling doesn\u2019t necessarily always go away. I just wanted to be honest, and I think that \u201cReplay\u201d was probably the first song that I put out was because I felt like it was sort of a reintroduction to the inner part of me that most people might not really know.",
      "But it\u2019s also a tricky song in that it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of upbeat, and if you actually listen, you hear that there\u2019s like a person who\u2019s a little bit fragile, a person whose trying to figure some things out, a person who\u2019s been through some things, who\u2019s dealt with things, who has abandonment issues, who has fear, who an inferiority complex sometimes, who wants to help everyone, who wants to save everyone, but gets it wrong.",
      "Those are human, human things that I want to share.",
      "ERIVO: No apprehension about writing it, a little apprehension about sharing it, because it\u2019s honest. But once it\u2019s done, what can you do? It\u2019s time to share.",
      "ERIVO: They feed each other. When I sing, I feel free and I feel open, which means that when I go and act \u2014 because I\u2019ve given myself that experience \u2014 the want to close off again sort of goes away. So, when I\u2019m on a set, I\u2019m as open as I am when I am singing. I\u2019m waiting to receive whatever I\u2019m getting from my counterpart or whoever\u2019s opposite me so I can actually listen. Because the act of writing and singing actually is also the act of listening.",
      "ERIVO: I had a sort of level of anonymity that I think I got used to and I really kind of enjoyed. That isn\u2019t necessarily there anymore, which is still really lovely because people are kind and sweet, and I\u2019m really grateful for it. But that\u2019s an adjustment, to realize that you can\u2019t just walk into a store and no one will know who you are, or you can\u2019t get on a plane, and no one will there you are. That\u2019s a new thing that I didn\u2019t expect or wasn't seeking.",
      "ERIVO: We have a couple pickups and then we\u2019re done.",
      "ERIVO: I\u2019m so proud of it. We spent a lot of time on it. We worked really, really hard on it. There was no stone unturned on it because I love what I do, and I love music, and I loved making it.",
      "So just know that this was made with a lot of love.",

      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers",
      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers.",
      "For TNT's Kenny Albert, it is another accomplishment in a year that has been filled with many, especially over the past nine months.",
      "Wednesday's Game 1 between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will be Albert's 1,483rd call in hockey, football or baseball for a national network. He moved past his father, the legendary Marv Albert, into fourth place among North American announcers during last Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final between Florida and Carolina.",
      "\u201cTo be listed along with some of the all-time greats who I watched growing up and then got to know a lot of them personally, it\u2019s a proud moment when you see that you\u2019re included in that group,\u201d Albert said. \u201cMy schedule definitely is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle between the various sports and networks, but very fortunate to work for and with so many great people.\u201d",
      "Albert surpassed the 500 games mark in both the NFL and NHL within a six-month period.",
      "He became the first NFL play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games on one network last October when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cleveland Browns in a game televised by Fox. He has been with Fox Sports since its beginning in 1994.",
      "He surpassed 500 national NHL games on Dec. 18 when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the Detroit Red Wings on TNT. Albert has been TNT's top hockey announcer since it got the rights in 2021.",
      "All told, Albert has done 534 NHL, 512 NFL, 421 baseball and 15 NBA games on a national broadcast or cable network. That is on top of his other duties as New York Rangers radio voice and backup for New York Knicks television games on MSG Network.",
      "Albert's versatility to do a plethora of different sports was something he picked up from his father. Even though Marv Albert's signature sport was the NBA, he also did the NFL and NHL along with hosting the baseball pregame show during the late 1980s on NBC.",
      "\u201cI've always loved the variety,\u201d Kenny Albert said.",
      "For all of the aforementioned accomplishments, though, the highlight of Albert's year so far was calling Alex Ovechkin's 895th NHL goal on April 6 to break Wayne Gretzky's career record. Albert's call during the second period, when the Washington Capitals star set the record against the New York Islanders, relayed excitement while also mentioning the goal number and then going silent so that the crowd and scenes from the crowd could take over.",
      "\u201cIn a championship situation or big moment, I don't usually write something out, but I do throw some words around in my mind just to be ready,\u201d Albert said. \"I was thinking something with his nickname, the Great Eight, the great Gretzky. When he tied the record, Joe Beninati (the Capitals TV announcer) used something similar to that, so I wanted to shift over to something else and not use some of the same words he did.",
      "\u201cWhen it happened, it just came out naturally. I mentioned No. 895 and then I just got out of the way. It was very important after the call to just lay out and let the production folks do their thing. Let the pictures and sound tell the story.\u201d",
      "According to TV database research compiled by Un/Necessary Sports Research, the late Bob Cole, who called the games for CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d for 50 years, leads the way at 1,722 (all hockey) games; followed by Dick Stockton, who did basketball, baseball and football for CBS and Fox, with 1,544; and Canadian play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert with 1,539. Cuthbert, the current lead voice for \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d will surpass Stockton if the Stanley Cup Final goes six games.",
      "Kevin Harlan is sixth at 1,477 and should surpass Marv Albert (1,481) for fifth during Week 5 of the upcoming NFL season.",
      "This will be the 11th Stanley Cup Final for Albert, including eight on radio, but the first where he has called a rematch from the previous year. This is the first final rematch since the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009 and the second over the past 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt has a chance to be one of the all-time great championship series,\" Albert said. \"These same teams played a scintillating seven-game series last June. Star power on both sides. Edmonton attempting to win Canada\u2019s first Cup since 1993. Florida looking to repeat. Can Connor McDavid match Wayne Gretzky and Sidney Crosby and win his first Stanley Cup against the team that beat his club in the Cup Final the year before? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "British writer Bernardine Evaristo has won the Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Bernardine Evaristo doesn't like boundaries.",
      "For the Booker Prize -winning novelist, rules about genre, grammar or what a working-class biracial woman can achieve are all to be challenged and swept away.",
      "Evaristo was announced Wednesday as recipient of the 100,000-pound ($135,000) Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature and her unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices.\"",
      "Evaristo, 66, received the prize both for her work to help promote women and writers of color, and for writing that takes in poetry, a memoir and seven novels including the Booker-winning \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just go wherever my imagination takes me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write the kind of novels that would take you on a predictable emotional or moral journey.\u201d",
      "Evaristo had already explored autobiographical fiction, historical settings and alternate realities when she won the Booker in 2019 for \u201cGirl Woman, Other,\u201d a polyphonic novel told from the point of view of a dozen characters, largely Black women, with widely varying ages, experiences and sexualities.",
      "She was the first woman of African heritage to be awarded the prize, which was founded in 1969 and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers.",
      "When she won, Evaristo was 60 and had been a writer for decades. She says the recognition \u201ccame at the right time for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well if I was younger,\u201d she told The Associated Press at her London home. \u201cIt changed my career \u2013- in terms of book sales, foreign rights, translation, the way in which I was viewed as a writer. Various other opportunities came my way. And I felt that I had the foundations to handle that.\u201d",
      "Evaristo\u2019s house on a quiet suburban street is bright and comfortable, with wooden floors, vibrant textiles and a large wooden writing desk by the front window. Large photos of her Nigerian paternal grandparents hang on one wall. Her work often draws on her roots as the London-born child of a Nigerian father and white British mother.",
      "Like much of Evaristo\u2019s work, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d eludes classification. She calls it \u201cfusion fiction\u201d for its melding of poetry and prose into a novel that relishes the texture and rhythm of language.",
      "\u201cI kind of dispense with the rules of grammar,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have 12 full stops in the novel.\u201d",
      "If that sounds dauntingly experimental, readers didn\u2019t think so. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d has sold more than 1 million copies and was chosen as one of Barack Obama\u2019s books of the year.",
      "Evaristo traces her love of poetry to the church services of her Catholic childhood, where she soaked up the rhythms of the Bible and sermons, \u201cwithout realizing I was absorbing poetry.\u201d",
      "When she started writing novels, the love of poetry remained, along with a desire to tell stories of the African diaspora. One of her first major successes, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Babe,\u201d is a verse novel set in Roman Britain.",
      "\u201cMost people think the Black history of Britain only began in the 20th century,\u201d Evaristo said. \u201cI wanted to write about a Black presence in Roman Britain -\u2013 because there was a Black presence in Roman Britain 1,800 years ago.\u201d",
      "Another novel, \u201cBlonde Roots,\u201d is set in an alternative historical timeline in which Africans have enslaved Europeans, and was nominated for a major science-fiction award.",
      "\u201cMr Loverman,\u201d which centers on a closeted gay 70-something Antiguan Londoner, was an attempt to move beyond cliched images of Britain\u2019s postwar Caribbean immigrants. It was recently made into a BBC television series starring Lennie James and Sharon D. Clarke.",
      "Her latest award is a one-off accolade marking the 30th anniversary of the annual Women\u2019s Prizes for English-language fiction and nonfiction.",
      "Women\u2019s Prize founder Kate Mosse said Evaristo\u2019s \u201cdazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career made her the ideal recipient.\u201d",
      "Evaristo, who teaches creative writing at Brunel University of London, plans to use the prize money to help other women writers through an as-yet undisclosed project.",
      "She has long been involved with projects to level the playing field for under-represented writers, and is especially proud of Complete Works, a mentoring program for poets of color that she ran for a decade.",
      "\u201cI set that up because I initiated research into how many poets of color were getting published in Britain at that time, and it was under 1%\u201d of the total, she said. A decade later, it was 10%.",
      "\"It really has helped shift the poetry landscape in the U.K.,\" she said.",
      "Evaristo followed \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d with \u201cManifesto,\u201d a memoir that recounts the stark racism of her 1960s London childhood, as well as her lifelong battle for creative expression and freedom.",
      "If Evaristo grew up as an outsider, these days she is ensconced in the arts establishment: professor, Booker winner, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, and president of the 200-year-old Royal Society of Literature.",
      "That milestone -\u2013 she\u2019s the first person of color and the second woman to head the RSL -\u2013 has not been trouble-free. The society has been ruffled by free speech tows and arguments over attempts to bring in younger writers and diversify its ranks -\u2013 moves seen by some as watering down the accolade of membership.",
      "Evaristo doesn\u2019t want to talk about the controversy, but notes that as figurehead president she does not run the society.",
      "She says Britain has come a long way since her childhood but \u201cwe have to be vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe country I grew up in is not the country I\u2019m in today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress, and I feel that we need to work hard to maintain it, especially in the current political climate where it feels as if the forces are against progress, and proudly so.",
      "\u201cWorking towards an anti-racist society is something that we should value, and I hope we do, and that we don\u2019t backslide too much.\u201d",

      "While Joss\u2019 husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire, San Antonio police have said they\u2019ve found \u201cno evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss\u2019 murder was related to his sexual orientation.\u201d Police did not respond to multiple emails on Tuesday seeking additional information on the cause of the shooting.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in accidents.",
      "U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton also ordered Girardi, 86, to pay a $35,000 fine and $2.3 million in restitution to former clients. A jury in August found him guilty of four counts of wire fraud, and he could have been sentenced to up to 80 years in prison.",
      "Girardi is the estranged husband of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Erika Jayne and appeared on the show himself dozens of times between 2015 and 2020.",
      "He was once among the most prominent lawyers in the nation, often representing victims of major disasters against powerful companies. One lawsuit against California\u2019s Pacific Gas and Electric utility led to a $333 million settlement and was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d",
      "But his law empire collapsed, and he was disbarred in California in 2022 over client thefts.",
      "Girardi has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and issues with his memory led another court to put him in a conservatorship under his brother. But on Monday, Staton ruled that he was mentally competent to be sentenced, just as she had previously found him mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "The judge had allowed him to remain free until his sentencing but ordered him to surrender to authorities by July 17.",
      "An email to Girardi\u2019s attorney seeking comment on the conviction was not immediately answered.",
      "Former clients who testified against Girardi at his trial included an Arizona woman whose husband was killed in a boat accident and victims who were burned in a 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, south of San Francisco.",
      "Prosecutors played jurors voicemails in which Girardi gave a litany of false reasons money that a court had awarded could not be paid, including tax and debt obligations and judge authorizations. He frequently told them, \u201cDon't be mad at me.\u201d",

      "Her awe quickly fades as sibling jealousies, parental frustrations, past sins and the pressures of legacy come tumbling out over a fraught dinner. There is some slapping.",
      "\u201cWe are so susceptible to get angry with the people we love the most,\u201d says Young. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the less than 12 hours of them being together for the first time in two years, they\u2019re sitting down and having dinner, and all of these things come up, as they often do.\u201d",
      "Young's work has earned her a Tony Award nomination and a chance to make history. Already the first Black person to be nominated four times consecutively, if she wins, she\u2019ll be the first Black performer to win two Tonys in a row.",
      "Young made her Broadway debut in 2021 in \u201cClyde\u2019s,\u201d was in \u201cCost of Living\u201d the next year and co-starred opposite Leslie Odom Jr. in 2024's \u201cPurlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch,\u201d winning a Tony.",
      "Jacobs-Jenkins calls Aziz in his script a \u201cdeeply perceptive person and empathetic\u201d and that could also apply to Young, She says she closely identifies with her character in \u201cPurpose,\u201d \u2014 they're both Harlem-bred advocates for others, hoping to make the planet better.",
      "\u201cI feel connected to that core of her,\u201d says Young. \u201cEvery single play I've done since my 10-minute play festivals, I\u2019m always like, \u2018Wow, this feels like this can change the world,\u2019 you know? And I feel like at the core of Aziza, that\u2019s how she feels. She wants to change the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose,\u201d directed by Phylicia Rashad, also stars LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Harry Lennix, Jon Michael Hill, Alana Arenas and Glenn Davis.",
      "Hill, who as Naz also earned a Tony nomination for best lead male actor in a play, calls Young \u201cthe heart and joy of our little family over there at the Helen Hayes.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe enters the building and she just makes time for everyone and is genuinely excited to see people and hear about how they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve really never seen anyone have as much room in their consciousness and their being for everyone she encounters. She approaches every day with joy and curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "If there's one story that shows who Young is, it would be from the day of the Met Gala, which she and cast members of \u201cPurpose\u201d were invited, along with its playwright. That same day, Jacobs-Jenkins won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",
      "Young found out while getting her makeup done and began screaming. When she got to the gala \u2014 a look-at-me moment, if there ever was one \u2014 she was a walking advertisement for the play. \u201cI told everybody, \u2018You have to come and see this play. He just won a Pulitzer!\u2019\u201d",
      "Hill was right behind her and smiling as Young made connections and introductions. \u201cShe was just going up to everyone and introducing us and talking about our show and trying to get folks in the door.\u201d",
      "Young made her 2016 stage debut in Patricia Ione Lloyd\u2019s play \u201cPretty Hunger\u201d at the Public Theater, a play about a 7-year-old Black girl who didn't know she was Black. The playwright told her she wrote it with Young in mind.",
      "\u201cIone Lloyd is one of the people who really made me see myself as an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that kind of set a path for me in a really beautiful way.\u201d",
      "Next up for Young is the movie \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which playwright Aleshea Harris is directing from her own 2018 stage play. Sterling K. Brown, Vivica A. Fox and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are in the cast. Young calls it \u201ca spaghetti Western-meets-Tarantino-meets-the Greeks.\u201d Next summer on Broadway, she'll star in a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d opposite Kerry Washington.",
      "After that, who knows? \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, but I can\u2019t wait, whatever that is,\u201d she says. \u201cIf something comes along, it\u2019s about jumping into the next thing. If there\u2019s life in me, I got to live it.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast plans to turn the success of his Amazon Prime Video reality competition series into millions of dollars for charity.",
      "YouTube\u2019s biggest creator is offering an exclusive weekend on the set of Beast Games Season 2 to the first 40 donors who make $100,000 gifts to his registered nonprofit. The earliest contributors and up to two guests each will spend June 27-29 touring MrBeast\u2019s North Carolina studio, hearing from the production team in a private Q&A and visiting Beast Philanthropy\u2019s food pantry.",
      "The invitation comes as Jimmy Donaldson\u2019s reported $5 billion media empire surpasses 400 million subscribers on YouTube, where he had already set the record for the biggest following. But the call raises a question: Who among his following of young people and their parents can make a six-figure donation?",
      "\u201cI have some big charity projects I want to fund so I think it\u2019s a win/win,\u201d MrBeast said in a post on X.",
      "Rallying his fervent fan base to make their own contributions marks a new fundraising strategy for Donaldson. He has long stated that his YouTube pages\u2019 featured charitable work is funded with his Beast Philanthropy channel\u2019s revenue.",
      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether. Responding to allegations that he uses philanthropy as a shield, Donaldson said he thinks \u201cit paints a negative spotlight on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople hate me more because I do good,\u201d Donaldson said in a conversation uploaded last November on the YouTube channel oompaville. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too crazy of a statement. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a victim here or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is, I just find videos where I help people more fun than videos where I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Amazon Prime Video renewed Beast Games for two more seasons. The reality competition series pitted 1,000 contestants against each other for a $5 million grand prize that doubled in the Feb. 13 finale. Forbes reported that the show broke the streaming service\u2019s record by totaling 50 million views in the 25 days after its premiere.",

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",

Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",

      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",

      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",

      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

      "THESSALONIKI, Greece -- Another series of unmarked graves \u2014 this one containing 14 individuals from Greece's civil war era \u2014 have been dug up in a park in a suburb near the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, local officials said Saturday.",
      "As in the previous tight cluster of unmarked burial pits excavated earlier this year in Neapolis-Sykies, the bodies belong to prisoners who were held in a nearby Byzantine fortress. The prisoners, alleged communists and sympathizers, were executed between 1946 and 1953, according to historians.",
      "The Yedi Kule castle, also known by its Greek name Eptapyrgio (\u201cseven towers\u201d) was a prison where communist sympathizers were tortured and executed during Greece\u2019s 1946-49 Civil War and immediately afterward.",
      "The burial pits were uncovered on the site of a municipal park undergoing renovation, including the installation of new benches. The graves were not far beneath the surface, Haris Charismiadis, the supervising engineer of the park project, told The Associated Press.",
      "The renovation project is not currently a priority for local mayor Simos Daniilidis. \u201cWe insisted on continuing the digging for the graves,\u201d he said. Charismiadis, who said most of the current batch of bodies were found during the past week, is certain there are more people buried nearby, including, probably, under the tarmac of streets adjacent to the park. An archaeologist is assisting in the digging.",
      "In contrast with the 33 bodies found earlier this year, which were lying side by side, the recently found bodies are jumbled, as if thrown randomly, and hastily, in a heap. Torsos and heads are separated.",
      "When Yedi Kule prisoners were executed, their families were often not notified and they didn\u2019t get to retrieve their bodies. Some found out about the fate of their loved ones from newspapers \u2014 one family happened upon the news while on the bus they had taken to the prison to bring their relative a fresh change of clothes.",
      "Relatives of the executed have clamored for DNA tests to be done to ascertain the identity of the found bodies. Testing has not begun yet.",

      "A small sport popular in Spain\u2019s northern Basque Country has stirred up a political controversy that triggered court action and fanned the region\u2019s long-held feelings of nationalism",
      "MADRID -- A small sport popular in Spain\u2019s northern Basque Country has stirred up a political controversy that triggered court action and fanned the region's long-held feelings of nationalism.",
      "There has been back-and-forth spats between sports officials and politicians after the Basque Country region was allowed to compete as a nation in international competitions in pelota vasca, a sport that was in the Olympics more than 100 years ago but is now rarely seen in most parts of the world.",
      "Even sport's highest court was asked to get involved.",
      "The dispute culminated this weekend in what many had thought was an impossible scenario: The Basque Country and Spain playing against each other in an international sporting event \u2014 the pelota vasca Nations League.",
      "The Basque Country, also known as Euskadi, maintains a strong cultural identity and traditions in a region once scarred by violence. The Basque separatist movement began in the late 1950s and was led by the now-defunct militant group ETA. In 2011, the group declared a \u201cdefinitive end\u201d to an armed conflict that killed nearly 900 people, and it officially disbanded in 2018.",
      "Pelota vasca, also known as Basque pelota, is played on a court with players using their hands and different types of rackets to hit the ball against a high wall. Depending on which version of the sport is being played, there are different court measurements \u2014 all of them with a high front wall and most with another high side wall. The biggest court is 54 meters long (177 feet long).",
      "In the Basque Country region, it\u2019s considered by many as a national sport.",
      "There were jeers when the Spanish national anthem played at the awards ceremony in the Basque Country location of Gernika-Lumo.",
      "The Basque Country won the men\u2019s final on Friday night, while Spain took the victory in the women\u2019s decider.",
      "The sport's Spanish federation had strongly opposed the recognition of the Basque team, citing alleged illegalities in the recognition process by the international body. It denounced \u201cpressure, threats and coercion\u201d against Basque players who had chosen to play for Spain.",
      "Spain eventually went to the Court of Arbitration for Sports and asked for a ruling on the legality of the changes made in the bylaws of the international federation to allow the Basque team to be recognized. The Spanish federation said it was not allowed to vote in the general assembly in late December. The CAS decision is still pending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essential to emphasize that this is not an issue against the Basque Country, but rather a matter of legality,\u201d the Spanish federation said in one of its many statements.",
      "The Spanish federation at one point complained of a lack of government support and was especially upset when the nation\u2019s top sports official, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Uribes, said that pelota vasca shouldn\u2019t be considered a Spanish sport in the sense that it is not played throughout the nation.",
      "The Spanish federation said the sport has an \u201cunquestionable national presence\u201d with more than 10,000 athletes in the country.",
      "Politicians in the Basque Country had deemed the recognition by the international federation as historic. They had been working on making that possible for several years but lacked legal backing within local laws and statutes.",
      "\u201cIt was unimaginable not too long ago to see these athletes wearing the Basque Country jersey in an international competition,\u201d said Aitor Esteban, president of the Basque Nationalist Party. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important and exciting step. It\u2019s another step toward national recognition as a country. This international presence gives us visibility.\u201d",
      "The Spanish federation said the Nations League can\u2019t be considered an official competition because the international federation did not meet the requirements needed to be able to host the event on Spanish soil, which included proper approval by Spanish officials.",
      "The Spanish federation said it only participated in the event out of consideration for its athletes who wanted to play and were afraid that the competition could eventually serve as a qualifier for next year\u2019s world championships in Argentina, as indicated by the international body. The Spanish federation insisted it can\u2019t be considered an official competition.",
      "The Basque federation of pelota vasca praised the fact that its national team became a \u201creality.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were born to grow and promote pelota vasca. It is part of our culture, of our identity and of our people,\" it said. \u201cWe look to the future with hope, the future is ours.\u201d",
      "In addition to Spain and the Basque Country, the other participants in the Nations League were the United States, France, Mexico and the Philippines.",
      "Pelota vasca was an official Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games and has been a demonstration sport several times since then, most recently in Barcelona in 1992. Variations of pelota vasca include jai alai, which in the United States is mostly played in Florida. Other countries where the sport is seen include France, Argentina, Mexico and Cuba.",

      "A top Taliban official says Afghans who fled the country can return home, offering a a general amnesty to those who left after the collapse of the former Western-backed government",
      "A top Taliban official said on Saturday that all Afghans who fled the country after the collapse of the former Western-backed government are free to return home, promising they would not be harmed if they come back.",
      "Taliban Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund made the amnesty offer in his message for the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, also known as the \u201cFeast of Sacrifice.\u201d",
      "The offer comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping travel ban on 12 countries, including Afghanistan. The measure largely bars Afghans hoping to resettle in the United States permanently as well as those hoping to go to the U.S. temporarily, such as for university study.",
      "Trump also suspended a core refugee program in January, all but ending support for Afghans who had allied with the U.S. and leaving tens of thousands of them stranded.",
      "Afghans in neighboring Pakistan who are awaiting resettlement are also dealing with a deportation drive by the Islamabad government to get them out of the country. Almost a million have left Pakistan since October 2023 to avoid arrest and expulsion.",
      "Akhund's holiday message was posted on the social platform X.",
      "\u201cAfghans who have left the country should return to their homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody will harm them.\"",
      "\"Come back to your ancestral land and live in an atmosphere of peace,\u201d he added, and instructed officials to properly manage services for returning refugees and to ensure they were given shelter and support.",
      "He also used the occasion to criticize the media for making what he said were \u201cfalse judgements\u201d about Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers and their policies.",
      "\u201cWe must not allow the torch of the Islamic system to be extinguished,\u201d he said. \u201cThe media should avoid false judgments and should not minimize the accomplishments of the system. While challenges exist, we must remain vigilant.\u201d",
      "The Taliban swept into the capital Kabul and seized most of Afghanistan in a blitz in mid-August 2021 as the U.S. and NATO forces were in the last weeks of their pullout from the country after 20 years of war.",
      "The offensive prompted a mass exodus, with tens of thousands of Afghans thronging the airport in chaotic scenes, hoping for a flight out on the U.S. military airlift. People also fled across the border, to neighboring Iran and Pakistan.",
      "Among those escaping the new Taliban rulers were also former government officials, journalists, activists, those who had helped the U.S. during its campaign against the Taliban.",

      "The new film \u201cOcean With David Attenborough\u201d is both a breathtaking celebration of marine life and a sobering expos\u00e9 of the industrial forces pushing the ocean toward collapse",
      "NICE, France -- An ominous chain unspools through the water. Then comes chaos. A churning cloud of mud erupts as a net plows the seafloor, wrenching rays, fish and a squid from their home in a violent swirl of destruction. This is industrial bottom trawling. It\u2019s not CGI. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s legal.",
      "\u201cOcean With David Attenborough\u201d is a brutal reminder of how little we see and how much is at stake. The film is both a sweeping celebration of marine life and a stark expos\u00e9 of the forces pushing the ocean toward collapse.",
      "The British naturalist and broadcaster, now 99, anchors the film with a deeply personal reflection: \u201cAfter living for nearly a hundred years on this planet, I now understand that the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\u201d",
      "The film traces Attenborough's lifetime \u2014 an era of unprecedented ocean discovery \u2014 through the lush beauty of coral reefs, kelp forests and deep-sea wanderers, captured in breathtaking, revelatory ways.",
      "But this is not the Attenborough film we grew up with. As the environment unravels, so too has the tone of his storytelling. \u201cOcean\u201d is more urgent, more unflinching. Never-before-seen footage of mass coral bleaching, dwindling fish stocks and industrial-scale exploitation reveals just how vulnerable the sea has become. The film\u2019s power lies not only in what it shows, but in how rarely such destruction is witnessed.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to the point where we\u2019ve changed so much of the natural world that it\u2019s almost remiss if you don\u2019t show it,\u201d co-director Colin Butfield said. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever professionally filmed bottom trawling before. And yet it\u2019s happening practically everywhere.\u201d",
      "The practice is not only legal, he adds, but often subsidized.",
      "\u201cFor too long, everything in the ocean has been invisible,\u201d Butfield said. \u201cMost people picture fishing as small boats heading out from a local harbor. They\u2019re not picturing factories at sea scraping the seabed.\u201d",
      "In one harrowing scene, mounds of unwanted catch are dumped back into the sea already dead. About 10 million tons (9 million metrics tonnes) of marine life are caught and discarded each year as bycatch. In some bottom trawl fisheries, discards make up more than half the haul.",
      "Still, \u201cOcean\u201d is no eulogy. Its final act offers a stirring glimpse of what recovery can look like: kelp forests rebounding under protection, vast marine reserves teeming with life and the world\u2019s largest albatross colony thriving in Hawaii\u2019s Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument. These aren\u2019t fantasies; they\u2019re evidence of what the ocean can become again, if given the chance.",
      "Timed to World Oceans Day and the U.N. Ocean Conference in Nice, the film arrives amid a growing global push to protect 30% of the ocean by 2030 \u2014 a goal endorsed by more than 190 countries. But today, just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from harmful industrial activity.",
      "The film\u2019s message is clear: The laws of today are failing the seas. So-called \u201cprotected\u201d areas often aren\u2019t. And banning destructive practices like bottom trawling is not just feasible \u2014 it\u2019s imperative.",
      "As always, Attenborough is a voice of moral clarity. \u201cThis could be the moment of change,\u201d he says. \u201cOcean\u201d gives us the reason to believe \u2014 and the evidence to demand \u2014 that it must be.",
      "\u201cOcean\u201d premieres Saturday on National Geographic in the U.S. and streams globally on Disney+ and Hulu beginning Sunday.",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican doesn\u2019t tax its residents or issue bonds, and it's got a very big budget problem",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The world's smallest country has a big budget problem.",
      "The Vatican doesn\u2019t tax its residents or issue bonds. It primarily finances the Catholic Church's central government through donations that have been plunging, ticket sales for the Vatican Museums, as well as income from investments and an underperforming real estate portfolio.",
      "The last year the Holy See published a consolidated budget, in 2022, it projected 770 million euros ($878 million), with the bulk paying for embassies around the world and Vatican media operations. In recent years, it hasn\u2019t been able to cover costs.",
      "That leaves Pope Leo XIV facing challenges to drum up the funds needed to pull his city-state out of the red.",
      "Anyone can donate money to the Vatican, but the regular sources come in two main forms.",
      "Canon law requires bishops around the world to pay an annual fee, with amounts varying and at bishops\u2019 discretion \u201caccording to the resources of their dioceses.\u201d U.S. bishops contributed over one-third of the $22 million (19.3 million euros) collected annually under the provision from 2021-2023, according to Vatican data.",
      "The other main source of annual donations is more well-known to ordinary Catholics: Peter\u2019s Pence, a special collection usually taken on the last Sunday of June. From 2021-2023, individual Catholics in the U.S. gave an average $27 million (23.7 million euros) to Peter\u2019s Pence, more than half the global total.",
      "American generosity hasn\u2019t prevented overall Peter\u2019s Pence contributions from cratering. After hitting a high of $101 million (88.6 million euros) in 2006, contributions hovered around $75 million (66.8 million euros) during the 2010's then tanked to $47 million (41.2 million euros) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many churches were closed.",
      "Donations remained low in the following years, amid revelations of the Vatican's bungled investment in a London property, a former Harrod\u2019s warehouse that it hoped to develop into luxury apartments. The scandal and ensuing trial confirmed that the vast majority of Peter's Pence contributions had funded the Holy See\u2019s budgetary shortfalls, not papal charity initiatives as many parishioners had been led to believe.",
      "Peter\u2019s Pence donations rose slightly in 2023 and Vatican officials expect more growth going forward, in part because there has traditionally been a bump immediately after papal elections.",
      "The Vatican bank and the city state's governorate, which controls the museums, also make annual contributions to the pope. As recently as a decade ago, the bank gave the pope around 55 million euros ($62.7 million) a year to help with the budget. But the amounts have dwindled; the bank gave nothing specifically to the pope in 2023, despite registering a net profit of 30 million euros ($34.2 million), according to its financial statements. The governorate's giving has likewise dropped off.",
      "Some Vatican officials ask how the Holy See can credibly ask donors to be more generous when its own institutions are holding back.",
      "Leo will need to attract donations from outside the U.S., no small task given the different culture of philanthropy, said the Rev. Robert Gahl, director of the Church Management Program at Catholic University of America\u2019s business school. He noted that in Europe there is much less of a tradition (and tax advantage) of individual philanthropy, with corporations and government entities doing most of the donating or allocating designated tax dollars.",
      "Even more important is leaving behind the \u201cmendicant mentality\u201d of fundraising to address a particular problem, and instead encouraging Catholics to invest in the church as a project, he said.",
      "Speaking right after Leo\u2019s installation ceremony in St. Peter\u2019s Square, which drew around 200,000 people, Gahl asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think there were a lot of people there that would have loved to contribute to that and to the pontificate?\u201d",
      "In the U.S., donation baskets are passed around at every Sunday Mass. Not so at the Vatican.",
      "The Vatican has 4,249 properties in Italy and 1,200 more in London, Paris, Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland. Only about one-fifth are rented at fair market value, according to the annual report from the APSA patrimony office, which manages them. Some 70% generate no income because they house Vatican or other church offices; the remaining 10% are rented at reduced rents to Vatican employees.",
      "In 2023, these properties only generated 35 million euros ($39.9 million) in profit. Financial analysts have long identified such undervalued real estate as a source of potential revenue.",
      "But Ward Fitzgerald, the president of the U.S.-based Papal Foundation, which finances papal charities, said the Vatican should also be willing to sell properties, especially those too expensive to maintain. Many bishops are wrestling with similar downsizing questions as the number of church-going Catholics in parts of the U.S. and Europe shrinks and once-full churches stand empty.",
      "Toward that end, the Vatican recently sold the property housing its embassy in Tokyo's high-end Sanbancho neighborhood, near the Imperial Palace, to a developer building a 13-story apartment complex, according to the Kensetsu News trade journal.",
      "Yet there has long been institutional reluctance to part with even money-losing properties. Witness the Vatican announcement in 2021 that the cash-strapped Fatebenefratelli Catholic hospital in Rome, run by a religious order, would not be sold. Pope Francis simultaneously created a Vatican fundraising foundation to keep it and other Catholic hospitals afloat.",
      "\u201cThey have to come to grips with the fact that they own so much real estate that is not serving the mission of the church,\u201d said Fitzgerald, who built a career in real estate private equity.",

      "One of the greatest challenges facing Pope Leo XIV is financial",
      "VATICAN CITY -- As a bishop in Peru, Robert Prevost was often on the lookout for used cars that he could buy cheap and fix up himself for use in parishes around his diocese. With cars that were really broken down, he\u2019d watch YouTube videos to learn how to fix them.",
      "That kind of make-do-with-less, fix-it-yourself mentality could serve Pope Leo XIV well as he addresses one of the greatest challenges facing him as pope: The Holy See\u2019s chronic, 50 million to 60 million euro ($57-68 million) structural deficit, 1 billion euro ($1.14 billion) pension fund shortfall and declining donations that together pose something of an existential threat to the central government of the 1.4-billion strong Catholic Church.",
      "As a Chicago-born math major, canon lawyer and two-time superior of his global Augustinian religious order, the 69-year-old pope presumably can read a balance sheet and make sense of the Vatican\u2019s complicated finances, which have long been mired in scandal. Whether he can change the financial culture of the Holy See, consolidate reforms Pope Francis started and convince donors that their money is going to good use is another matter.",
      "Leo already has one thing going for him: his American-ness. U.S. donors have long been the economic life support system of the Holy See, financing everything from papal charity projects abroad to restorations of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at home. Leo\u2019s election as the first American pope has sent a jolt of excitement through U.S. Catholics, some of whom had soured on donating to the Vatican after years of unrelenting stories of mismanagement, corruption and scandal, according to interviews with top Catholic fundraisers, philanthropists and church management experts.",
      "\u201cI think the election of an American is going to give greater confidence that any money given is going to be cared for by American principles, especially of stewardship and transparency,\u201d said the Rev. Roger Landry, director of the Vatican\u2019s main missionary fundraising operation in the U.S., the Pontifical Mission Societies.",
      "\u201cSo there will be great hope that American generosity is first going to be appreciated and then secondly is going to be well handled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t always been the circumstance, especially lately.\u201d",
      "Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on a mandate to reform the Vatican\u2019s opaque finances and made progress during his 12-year pontificate, mostly on the regulatory front. With help from the late Australian Cardinal George Pell, Francis created an economy ministry and council made up of clergy and lay experts to supervise Vatican finances, and he wrestled the Italian-dominated bureaucracy into conforming to international accounting and budgetary standards.",
      "He authorized a landmark, if deeply problematic, corruption trial over a botched London property investment that convicted a once-powerful Italian cardinal. And he punished the Vatican\u2019s Secretariat of State that had allowed the London deal to go through by stripping it of its ability to manage its own assets.",
      "But Francis left unfinished business and his overall record, at least according to some in the donor community, is less than positive. Critics cite Pell\u2019s frustrated reform efforts and the firing of the Holy See\u2019s first-ever auditor general, who says he was ousted because he had uncovered too much financial wrongdoing.",
      "Despite imposing years of belt-tightening and hiring freezes, Francis left the Vatican in somewhat dire financial straits: The main stopgap bucket of money that funds budgetary shortfalls, known as the Peter\u2019s Pence, is nearly exhausted, officials say. The 1 billion euro ($1.14 billion) pension fund shortfall that Pell warned about a decade ago remains unaddressed, though Francis had planned reforms. And the structural deficit continues, with the Holy See logging an 83.5 million euro ($95 million) deficit in 2023, according to its latest financial report.",
      "As Francis\u2019 health worsened, there were signs that his efforts to reform the Vatican\u2019s medieval financial culture hadn\u2019t really stuck, either. The very same Secretariat of State that Francis had punished for losing tens of millions of euros in the scandalous London property deal somehow ended up heading up a new papal fundraising commission that was announced while Francis was in the hospital. According to its founding charter and statutes, the commission is led by the Secretariat of State\u2019s assessor, is composed entirely of Italian Vatican officials with no professional fundraising expertise and has no required external financial oversight.",
      "To some Vatican watchers, the commission smacks of the Italian-led Secretariat of State taking advantage of a sick pope to announce a new flow of unchecked donations into its coffers after its 600 million euro ($684 million) sovereign wealth fund was taken away and given to another office to manage as punishment for the London fiasco.",
      "\u201cThere are no Americans on the commission. I think it would be good if there were representatives of Europe and Asia and Africa and the United States on the commission,\u201d said Ward Fitzgerald, president of the U.S.-based Papal Foundation. It is made up of wealthy American Catholics that since 1990 has provided over $250 million (219 million euros) in grants and scholarships to the pope\u2019s global charitable initiatives.",
      "Fitzgerald, who spent his career in real estate private equity, said American donors \u2014 especially the younger generation \u2014 expect transparency and accountability from recipients of their money, and know they can find non-Vatican Catholic charities that meet those expectations.",
      "\u201cWe would expect transparency before we would start to solve the problem,\u201d he said.",
      "That said, Fitzgerald said he hadn\u2019t seen any significant let-up in donor willingness to fund the Papal Foundation's project-specific donations during the Francis pontificate. Indeed, U.S. donations to the Vatican overall have remained more or less consistent even as other countries' offerings declined, with U.S. bishops and individual Catholics contributing more than any other country in the two main channels to donate to papal causes.",
      "Francis moved Prevost to take over the diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2014. Residents and fellow priests say he consistently rallied funds, food and other life-saving goods for the neediest \u2014 experience that suggests he knows well how to raise money when times are tight and how to spend wisely.",
      "He bolstered the local Caritas charity in Chiclayo, with parishes creating food banks that worked with local businesses to distribute donated food, said the Rev. Fidel Purisaca Vigil, a diocesan spokesperson.",
      "In 2019, Prevost inaugurated a shelter on the outskirts of Chiclayo, Villa San Vicente de Paul, to house desperate Venezuelan migrants who had fled their country's economic crisis. The migrants remember him still, not only for helping give them and their children shelter, but for bringing live chickens obtained from a donor.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prevost launched a campaign to raise funds to build two oxygen plants to provide hard-hit residents with life-saving oxygen. In 2023, when massive rains flooded the region, he personally brought food to the flood-struck zone.",
      "Within hours of his May 8 election, videos went viral on social media of Prevost, wearing rubber boots and standing in a flooded street, pitching a solidarity campaign, \u201cPeru Give a Hand,\u201d to raise money for flood victims.",
      "The Rev. Jorge Mill\u00e1n, who lived with Prevost and eight other priests for nearly a decade in Chiclayo, said he had a \u201cmathematical\u201d mentality and knew how to get the job done. Prevost would always be on the lookout for used cars to buy for use around the diocese, Mill\u00e1n said, noting that the bishop often had to drive long distances to reach all of his flock or get to Lima, the capital.",
      "Prevost liked to fix them up himself, and if he didn\u2019t know what to do, \u201che\u2019d look up solutions on YouTube and very often he\u2019d find them,\u201d Mill\u00e1n told The Associated Press.",
      "Before going to Peru, Prevost served two terms as prior general, or superior, of the global Augustinian order. While the order\u2019s local provinces are financially independent, Prevost was responsible for reviewing their balance sheets and oversaw the budgeting and investment strategy of the order\u2019s headquarters in Rome, said the Rev. Franz Klein, the order\u2019s Rome-based economist who worked with Prevost.",
      "The Augustinian campus sits on prime real estate just outside St. Peter\u2019s Square and supplements revenue by renting out its picturesque terrace to media organizations (including the AP) for major Vatican events, including the conclave that elected Leo pope.",
      "But even Prevost saw the need for better fundraising, especially to help out poorer provinces. Toward the end of his 12-year term and with his support, a committee proposed creation of a foundation, Augustinians in the World. At the end of 2023, it had 994,000 euros ($1.13 million) in assets and was helping fund self-sustaining projects across Africa, including a center to rehabilitate former child soldiers in Congo.",
      "\u201cHe has a very good interest and also a very good feeling for numbers,\u201d Klein said. \u201cI have no worry about the finances of the Vatican in these years because he is very, very clever.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same sheep as the one I bought last year, the same look and the same weight, but it costs $75 more,\" Aouadi, a doctor, told The Associated Press.",
      "Amid soaring inflation, sheep can sell for more than $1,200, an exorbitant amount in a country where average monthly incomes hover below $270.",
      "Any disruption to the ritual sacrifice can be sensitive, a blow to religious tradition and source of anger toward rising prices and the hardship they bring.",
      "So Morocco and Algeria have resorted to unprecedented measures.",
      "Algerian officials earlier this year announced plans to import a staggering 1 million sheep to make up for domestic shortages. Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI broke with tradition and urged Muslims to abstain from the Eid sacrifice. Local officials across the kingdom have closed livestock markets, preventing customers from buying sheep for this year\u2019s celebrations.",
      "\u201cOur country is facing climatic and economic challenges that have resulted in a substantial decline in livestock numbers. Performing the sacrifice in these difficult circumstances will cause real harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited incomes,\u201d the king, who is also Morocco\u2019s highest religious authority, wrote in a February letter read on national television.",
      "Trucks have unloaded thousands of sheep in new markets in Algiers and the surrounding suburbs. University of Toulouse agro-economist Lotfi Gharnaout told the state-run newspaper El Moudjahid that Algeria\u2019s import strategy could cost between $230 and $260 million and still not even meet nationwide demand.",
      "Overgrazing has long strained parts of North Africa where the population is growing and job opportunities beyond herding and farming are scarce. But after seven years of drought, it\u2019s the lack of rainfall and skyrocketing feed prices that are now shrinking herds. Drought conditions, experts say, have degraded forage lands where shepherds graze their flocks and farmers grow cereals to be sold as animal feed.",
      "With less supply, prices have spiked beyond the reach of middle class families who have historically purchased sheep for slaughter.",
      "Moroccan economist Najib Akesbi said shrinking herds stemmed directly from vegetation loss in grazing areas. The prolonged drought has compounded inflation already fueled by the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cMost livestock farming in North Africa is pastoral, which means it\u2019s farming that relies purely on nature, like wild plants and forests, and vegetation that grows off rainwater,\u201d Akesbi, a former professor at Hassan II Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, said.",
      "For breeders, he added, livestock serve as a kind of bank, assets they sell to cover expenses and repay debts. With consecutive years of drought and rising feed costs, breeders are seeing their reserves drained.",
      "With less natural vegetation, breeders have to spend more on supplemental feed, Acharf Majdoubi, president of Morocco\u2019s Association of Sheep and Goat Breeders said. In good years, pastures can nourish nearly all of what sheep flocks require, but in dry years, it can be as low as half or a third of the feed required.",
      "\u201cWe have to make up the rest by buying feed like straw and barley,\u201d he said.",
      "Not only do they need more feed. The price of barley, straw and alfalfa -- much of which has to be imported -- has also spiked.",
      "In Morocco, the price of barley and straw are three times what they were before the drought, while the price of alfalfa has more than doubled.",
      "\u201cThe future of this profession is very difficult. Breeders leave the countryside to immigrate to the city, and some will never come back,\u201d Achraf Majdoubi said.",

      "A failed crossing from Mauritania\u2019s coast toward Spain\u2019s Canary Islands in which 44 Pakistanis perished earlier this year has cast a spotlight on how globalized and sophisticated smuggling networks on the West African coast have become",
      "DERA BAJWA, Pakistan -- It was supposed to be the final leg of Amir Ali's monthslong journey to Europe. But he was nowhere near his destination, with only death in sight.",
      "The 21-year-old Pakistani had been promised a visa and a flight to Spain. Yet six months, four countries and $17,000 later, he found himself crammed in a fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean alongside 85 others, screaming for their lives as seawater sloshed over the gunwales.",
      "Forty-four fellow Pakistani migrants perished during the 10-day failed crossing in January from Mauritania's coast toward Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "The deadly journey cast a spotlight on how globalized and sophisticated smuggling networks on the West African coast \u2014 and specifically Mauritania \u2014 have become. Interviews with survivors and relatives of migrants who died revealed how smugglers have adapted to tighter border controls and anti-migration policies across the Mediterranean and North Africa, resorting to lengthier, more dangerous routes.",
      "Ali\u2019s odyssey began last July. After making an initial deposit of 600,000 Pakistani rupees ($2,127), he went to Karachi airport, where he was told to wait for a shift change before approaching the immigration counter.",
      "\u201cThe smugglers had inside help,\u201d he said. He and other migrants were swiftly put on a flight to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",
      "From there Ali boarded a second flight to Dakar, Senegal, where he was told someone would be waiting for him.",
      "Instead, when he arrived he was told to go to the Senegal River bordering Mauritania, a seven-hour taxi ride north. He joined other Pakistanis traveling to the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott. In each country he passed through, bribes were demanded for visas, Ali said.",
      "Imran Iqbal, 42, took a similar journey. Like Ali, he flew from Karachi to Senegal via Ethiopia before reaching Mauritania. Other Pakistanis Iqbal met, he said, traveled through Kenya or Zimbabwe enroute to Mauritania.",
      "Once in Mauritania, the migrants were taken to cramped safe houses where smugglers took their belongings and deprived them of food. \u201cOur passports, our money \u2014 everything,\u201d Iqbal said. \u201cI was essentially held captive,\u201d Ali said.",
      "During the six months Iqbal and Ali were in Mauritania, smugglers moved them repeatedly, beating them to extract more money.",
      "While he managed to get some money sent from Pakistan, Iqbal did not tell his family of his dire situation.",
      "\u201cOur parents, children, siblings ... they would've been devastated,\" he said.",
      "Ali said the smugglers lied to their families in Pakistan, who asked about their whereabouts and questioned why they hadn't called from Spain.",
      "Finally, on Jan. 2, Iqbal, Ali and the other Pakistani migrants were transferred to an overcrowded boat that set course for Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "\u201cOn the day of departure, 64 Pakistanis from various safe houses were brought to the port,\u201d Ali recalled. \u201cThe Mauritanian police and port officials, who were complicit, facilitated our transfer to the boats.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat followed were the hardest 15 days of my life,\" Iqbal said.",
      "Mauritanian authorities have launched several investigations into smuggling networks and, in the past two months, heightened surveillance at the country\u2019s borders and ports, according to a Mauritanian embassy official in Madrid who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to comment publicly.",
      "While migration to Europe has been falling steadily, the Atlantic Ocean crossing from West Africa to Spain\u2019s Canary Islands has reemerged since 2020.",
      "Nearly 47,000 people disembarked in the Canaries in 2024, an increase from the nearly 40,000 in 2023, according to Spanish Interior Ministry figures.",
      "Until recently, the route was mostly used by migrants from West African nations fleeing poverty or violence. But since last year, migrants from far-flung countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan have increasingly embarked on the fishing boats used to reach the European archipelago.",
      "Smugglers connect with migrants locally in Pakistan and elsewhere, as well as on social media. Migrants post videos of their voyages on TikTok. Although some warn of the dangers, they also share idyllic videos of life in Europe, from Canary Island beaches to the bustling streets of Barcelona and Madrid. For many, Spain is just an entry point for continuing to France, Italy and elsewhere.",
      "Chris Borowski, spokesperson for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex, believes smuggling networks bringing Pakistanis and other South Asian migrants through the Canaries are still \u201ctesting the waters\u201d to see how profitable it is.",
      "However, experts at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime warn the route is here to stay.",
      "\u201cWith the conflict landscape showing no sign of improvement, movement on the Canary Islands route looks set to increase,\u201d the group warned. \u201cBecause it remains the deadliest migration route in the world, this has severe humanitarian implications.\"",
      "The Atlantic Ocean crossing can take days or weeks. Dozens of boats have vanished.",
      "Exact figures don't exist, but the International Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrants Project recorded at least 1,142 deaths and disappearances last year, a number it calls a vast understatement. Spanish rights group Walking Borders reported nearly 9,800 victims on the Canaries route last year \u2014 which would make it the world's deadliest migration route.",
      "Only a tiny fraction of bodies are ever recovered. Some shipwrecked vessels have appeared hundreds of thousands of miles away, in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The boat Ali and Iqbal boarded had a 40-person capacity but was packed with more than double that. Immediately, there were fights between the Pakistanis and the Africans on board, they said.",
      "The Associated Press wasn\u2019t able to locate non-Pakistani survivors to verify the accusations, but reports of violence on the Canaries journey are frequent even among those of the same nationality and ethnicity. Dehydration can cause hallucinations, exacerbating tensions.",
      "\u201cThe weather was terrible,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAs water entered the boat, the crew threw our belongings and food into the sea to keep the boat afloat.\u201d",
      "On the fifth day, a man died of a heart attack, Ali and Iqbal said. More people perished every day, their bodies thrown overboard; while some died from hunger and thirst, the majority were killed.",
      "\u201cThe crew attacked us with hammers, killing 15 in one night,\u201d Ali said. Both men showed photos of injuries others sustained, although AP couldn't verify what caused them.",
      "\u201cThe beatings were mostly to the head \u2014 so brutal that people started losing their sanity,\u201d Iqbal said. They prayed for a merciful death, convinced they had little chance of survival.",
      "On the 10th night, after dozens had died, lights appeared on the horizon. They shouted for help. At daybreak, a fishing vessel approached, handing them food and water before eventually towing them to the West African coast two days later. Forty-four Pakistanis had died.",
      "\u201cOnly twelve bodies returned to Pakistan,\" Ali said. \"The rest were lost at sea.\u201d",
      "News of the failed journey made international headlines, prompting a pledge by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari to go after smugglers.",
      "Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency has arrested dozens of people suspected of arranging the journey or connections to the smugglers.",
      "A nationwide crackdown was already underway, but smugglers change locations to evade capture. In Europe and Pakistan, smugglers who are caught are primarily low-level operatives, resulting in limited impact on the overall business.",
      "Staring at the mansions being built around his modest brick home in the Pakistani village of Dera Bajwa, Ali reflected on his wasted journey.",
      "\u201cThese are the houses of those who made it abroad,\" Ali said. \u201cPeople like me see them and dream without thinking.\"",

Her trip also marks the 130th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.",

      "\u201cI felt that the immigrants made an enormous effort to adapt to Brazil, and still today are very active in different areas. The fact that Brazil sheltered the Japanese community made the connections between the two countries to become deeper,\u201d the princess said.",
      "Today, Brazil has the largest population of people of Japanese descent in the world, estimated at about 2.7 million. About half of those live in Sao Paulo state, official figures show.",

      "Smith, secretary general of the Banana Industry Workers Union, had said earlier Friday before Mulino\u2019s announcement that he was open to dialogue.

      "As Western influence in the region has waned, Russia has sought to step into the vacuum, sweeping in with offers of assistance. Moscow initially expanded its military cooperation with African nations by using the Wagner Group of mercenaries. But since the group\u2019s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash in 2023, after mounting a brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has been developing the Africa Corps as a rival force to Wagner.",

      "\u201cSince the death of Prigozhin, Russia has had this whole plan to then make the Wagner Group fall under the command of the Ministry of Defense. One of the steps they made was to revamp or introduce the Africa Corps, which is the way in which the Russian paramilitaries would retain a presence in areas where the Wagner group has been operating,\u201d Ochieng said.",
      "Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. But the Malian army and Russian mercenaries struggled to curb violence in the country and have both been accused of targeting civilians.",
      "Last month, United Nations experts urged Malian authorities to investigate reports of alleged summary executions and forced disappearances by Wagner mercenaries and the army.",
      "In December, Human Rights Watch accused Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group of deliberately killing at least 32 civilians over an 8-month span.",

      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the major losses might have caused the possible end of Wagner's mission.",
      "\u201cThe lack of an official and mutual announcement from both the Malian authorities and Wagner indicate possible internal dispute which led to this sudden decision. Simultaneously, this could point to a new framework for Russian presence in the country,\" he said.",
      "Replacing Wagner with Africa Corps troops would likely shift Russia's focus in Mali from fighting alongside the Malian army to training, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.",
      "\u201cAfrica Corps has a lighter footprint and focuses more on training, providing equipment and doing protection services. They fight less than the \u2018Rambo-type\u2019 Wagner mercenaries,\u201d Laessing said.",

      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely gouge a hole in the federal budget.",
      "The president has a patch handy, though: his sweeping import taxes \u2014 tariffs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax and spending matters, says the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by the House last month and now under consideration in the Senate, would increase federal budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That is because its tax cuts would drain the government\u2019s coffers faster than its spending cuts would save money.",
      "By bringing in revenue for the Treasury, on the other hand, the tariffs that Trump announced through May 13 \u2014 including his so-called reciprocal levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States has a trade deficit \u2014 would offset the budget impact of the tax-cut bill and reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.5 trillion.",
      "So it\u2019s basically a wash.",
      "That\u2019s the budget math anyway. The real answer is more complicated.",
      "Actually using tariffs to finance a big chunk of the federal government would be a painful and perilous undertaking, budget wonks say. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous way to try to raise revenue,\u201d said Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department.",
      "Trump has long advocated tariffs as an economic elixir. He says they can protect American industries, bring factories back to the United States, give him leverage to win concessions over foreign governments \u2014 and raise a lot of money. He\u2019s even suggested that they could replace the federal income tax, which now brings in about half of federal revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters in April. \u201cI think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u2019\u2019",
      "Economists and budget analysts do not share the president\u2019s enthusiasm for using tariffs to finance the government or to replace other taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad trade,\u2019\u2019 said Erica York, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of federal tax policy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the dumbest tax reform you could design.\u2019\u2019",
      "For one thing, Trump\u2019s tariffs are an unstable source of revenue. He bypassed Congress and imposed his biggest import tax hikes through executive orders. That means a future president could simply reverse them.",
      "\u201cOr political whims in Congress could change, and they could decide, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going revoke this authority because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing that the president can just unilaterally impose a $2 trillion tax hike,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 York said.",
      "Or the courts could kill his tariffs before Congress or future presidents do. A federal court in New York has already struck down the centerpiece of his tariff program \u2014 the reciprocal and other levies he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 April 2 \u2014 saying he\u2019d overstepped his authority. An appeals court has allowed the government to keep collecting the levies while the legal challenge winds its way through the court system.",
      "Economists also say that tariffs damage the economy. They are a tax on foreign products, paid by importers in the United States and usually passed along to their customers via higher prices. They raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials, components and equipment, making them less competitive than foreign rivals that don\u2019t have to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Tariffs also invite retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports by foreign countries. Indeed, the European Union this week threatened \u201ccountermeasures\u2019\u2019 against Trump\u2019s unexpected move to raise his tariff on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just getting the effect of a tax on the U.S. economy,\u201d York said. \u201cYou\u2019re also getting the effect of foreign taxes on U.S. exports.\u2019\u2019",
      "She said the tariffs will basically wipe out all economic benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts.",
      "Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model said that tariffs also isolate the United States and discourage foreigners from investing in its economy.",
      "Foreigners see U.S. Treasurys as a super-safe investment and now own about 30% of the federal government\u2019s debt. If they cut back, the federal government would have to pay higher interest rates on Treasury debt to attract a smaller number of potential investors domestically.",
      "Higher borrowing costs and reduced investment would wallop the economy, making tariffs the most economically destructive tax available, Smetters said \u2014 more than twice as costly in reduced economic growth and wages as what he sees as the next-most damaging: the tax on corporate earnings.",
      "Tariffs also hit the poor hardest. They end up being a tax on consumers, and the poor spend more of their income than wealthier people do.",
      "Even without the tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill slams the poorest because it makes deep cuts to federal food programs and to Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. After the bill\u2019s tax and spending cuts, an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found, the poorest fifth of American households earning less than $17,000 a year would see their incomes drop by $820 next year. The richest 0.1% earning more than $4.3 million a year would come out ahead by $390,070 in 2026.",
      "\u201cIf you layer a regressive tax increase like tariffs on top of that, you make a lot of low- and middle-income households substantially worse off,\u2019\u2019 said the Tax Foundation\u2019s York.",
      "Overall, she said, tariffs are \u201ca very unreliable source of revenue for the legal reasons, the political reasons as well as the economic reasons. They\u2019re a very, very inefficient way to raise revenue. If you raise a dollar of a revenue with tariffs, that\u2019s going to cause a lot more economic harm than raising revenue any other way.\u2019\u2019",

      "Air quality regulators in Southern California are debating proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters",
      "DIAMOND BAR, Calif. -- Air quality regulators in Southern California heard impassioned public comments Friday before an anticipated vote on proposed rules that would curb harmful emissions from gas-powered furnaces and water heaters.",
      "The rules aim to reduce emissions of smog-contributing nitrogen oxides, also called NOx, a group of pollutants linked to respiratory issues, asthma attacks, worse allergies, decreased lung function in children, premature death and more. Burning natural gas is also one of the primary drivers of climate change.",
      "The South Coast Air Quality Management District estimates that the rules, if passed, will lower NOx emissions from gas-fired furnaces, preventing about 2,490 premature deaths and 10,200 new asthma cases over a 26-year period in the region. The district regulates air quality for 16.8 million people in Southern California, including all of Orange County and large areas of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties \u2014 one of the smoggiest areas in the U.S.",
      "The proposals come as California moves aggressively to reduce the state\u2019s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels and ahead of a 2045 mandate for the state to have net-zero carbon emissions.",
      "The rules would set targets that aim to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters starting in 2027. It does not apply to gas stoves. The sales target would start at 30%, then grow to 50% in 2029 and end at 90% in 2039. The rules would not be mandated, but manufacturers would have to pay fees ranging from $50 to $500 if they sell gas-powered appliances.",
      "That's a significant rollback from the original proposal, which would have required residential buildings to meet zero-emissions standards beginning in 2029 when appliances need to be replaced. The agency amended the rules after strong opposition from Southern California Gas and other businesses.",
      "The regulations would impact more than 10 million appliances in an estimated 5 million buildings, most of them residential.",
      "Officials and supporters say the rules would reduce air pollution and substantially improve public health. But opponents \u2014 including property owners, industry professionals and natural gas companies \u2014 fear they could raise costs for consumers and businesses, and strain the power grid by adding more electric appliances.",
      "During a packed board meeting Friday, clean air advocates held signs reading \u201cClean Air Now,\" \u201cVote 4 Clean Air, Vote 4 Justice\" and \u201cLet SoCal Breath!\u201d",
      "Before public comments, board chair Vanessa Delgado thanked the more than 200 people who signed up to speak about the rules, which took more than two years to craft.",
      "\u201cI don't believe that there's necessarily a good or right answer about these rules. I believe that it is very complicated and I know that every single one of these board members are doing what is right to move forward air quality goals in our region,\" she said.",
      "Lynwood City Councilmember Juan Mu\u00f1oz-Guevara said the rules would be a long-overdue step toward environmental justice for communities like his.",
      "\u201cI've seen firsthand how families in my community are forced to live with the health consequences of dirty air. Our children grow up with asthma, our elders struggle with respiratory illness, and too many lives are cut short,\" he said. \"Gas appliances in our home are one of the largest sources of smog-forming pollution in the region. We cannot meet clean air goals without tackling this.\u201d",
      "Peggy Huang, a member of Yorba Linda's City Council, urged the board to reject the rules.",
      "\u201cAs someone who's been advocating for affordable housing, this will increase costs for us to meet those goals,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Chino's mayor pro tem, Curtis Burton, echoed some of Huang's concerns. He said the rules would \u201ccreate an additional financial burden on residents and businesses.\u201d",
      "But air quality regulators say the rules would save consumers money by reducing energy bills.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The Bush family's nonprofit Points of Light will lead an effort to double the number of people who volunteer with U.S. charitable organizations from 75 million annually to 150 million in 10 years.",
      "The ambitious goal, announced in New Orleans at the foundation's annual conference, which concluded Friday, would represent a major change in the way Americans spend their time and interact with nonprofits.",
      "It aspires to mobilize people to volunteer with nonprofits in the U.S. at a scale that only federal programs like AmeriCorps have in the past.",
      "It also coincides with deep federal funding cuts that threaten the financial stability of many nonprofits and with an effort to gut AmeriCorps programs, which sent 200,000 volunteers all over the country. A judge on Wednesday paused those cuts in some states, which had sued the Trump administration.",
      "Jennifer Sirangelo, president and CEO of Points of Light, said that while the campaign has been in development well before the federal cuts, the nonprofit\u2019s board members recently met and decided to move forward.",
      "\u201cWhat our board said was, \u2018We have to do it now. We have to put the stake in the ground now. It\u2019s more important than it was before the disruption of AmeriCorps,\u2019\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press. She said the nonprofit aims to raise and spend $100 million over the next three years to support the goal.",
      "Points of Light, which is based in Atlanta, was founded by President George H.W. Bush to champion his vision of volunteerism. It has carried on his tradition of giving out a daily award to a volunteer around the country, built a global network of volunteer organizations and cultivated corporate volunteer programs.",
      "Speaking Wednesday in New Orleans, Points of Light's board chair Neil Bush told the organization's annual conference that the capacity volunteers add to nonprofits will have a huge impact on communities.",
      "\u201cOur mission is to make volunteering and service easier, more impactful, more sustained,\" Bush said. \"Because, let\u2019s be honest, the problems in our communities aren\u2019t going to fix themselves.\u201d",
      "According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps, the rate of participation has plateaued since 2002, with a noticeable dip during the pandemic.",
      "Susan M. Chambr\u00e9, professor emerita at Baruch College who studied volunteering for decades, said Points of Light's goal of doubling the number of volunteers was admirable but unrealistic, given that volunteer rates have not varied significantly over time.",
      "But she said more research is needed into what motivates volunteers, which would give insight into how to recruit people. She also said volunteering has become more transactional over time, directed by staff as opposed to organized by volunteers themselves.",
      "In making its case for increasing volunteer participation in a recent report, Points of Light drew on research from nonprofits like Independent Sector, the National Alliance for Volunteer Engagement and the Do Good Institute at the University of Maryland.",
      "Sirangelo said they want to better measure the impact volunteers make, not just the hours they put in, for example. They also see a major role for technology to better connect potential volunteers to opportunities, though they acknowledge that many have tried to do that through apps and online platforms.",
      "Reaching young people will also be a major part of accomplishing this increase in volunteer participation. Sirangelo said she's observed that many young people who do want to participate are founding their own nonprofits rather than joining an existing one.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not welcoming them to our institutions, so they have to go found something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat dynamic has to change.\u201d",
      "As the board was considering this new goal, they reached out for advice to Alex Edgar, who is now the youth engagement manager at Made By Us. They ultimately invited him to join the board as a full voting member and agreed to bring on a second young person as well.",
      "\u201cI think for volunteering and the incredible work that Points of Light is leading to really have a deeper connection with my generation, it needs to be done in a way that isn\u2019t just talking to or at young people, but really co-created across generations,\u201d said Edgar, who is 21.",
      "Karmit Bulman, who has researched and supported volunteer engagement for many years, said she was very pleased to see Points of Light make this commitment.",
      "\u201cThey are probably the most well known volunteerism organization in the country and I really appreciate their leadership,\u201d said Bulman, who is currently the executive director of East Side Learning Center, a nonprofit in St. Paul.",
      "Bulman said there are many people willing to help out in their communities but who are not willing to jump through hoops to volunteer with a nonprofit.",
      "\u201cWe also need to recognize that it\u2019s a pretty darn stressful time in people\u2019s lives right now,\u201d she said. \"There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty personally and professionally and financially for a lot of people.

      "Michaels on Thursday said that its purchase of Joann's IP and private brands included the acquisition of \u201cBig Twist\u201d yarns, which had become a staple in Joann stores over the years.",
      "Those \u201cBig Twist\u201d labels are now being developed as part of Michaels' portfolio \u2014 and will be available in-stores and online later this year, the company said. In the meantime, Michaels has also dedicated a landing page to welcome former Joann customers online.",
      "And as part of its overall expansion into fabrics, Michaels said on Thursday that its adding more than 600 new products from new and existing brands \u2014 including quilting supplies and fabrics, specialty threads, sewing machines and more.",
      "Michaels, founded in 1973, currently operates 1,300 stores across 49 U.S. states and Canada. Its parent company also owns Artistree, a framing merchandise manufacturer.",

      "At a minimum, the explosion of animosity between the two powerful men could complicate the path forward for Republicans' massive tax and border spending legislation that has been promoted by Trump but assailed by Musk.",
      "\u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t distract us from getting the job done that we need to,\u201d said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state. \"I think that it will boil over and they\u2019ll mend fences\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, was similarly optimistic.",
      "\u201cI hope that both of them come back together because when the two of them are working together, we\u2019ll get a lot more done for America than when they\u2019re at cross purposes,\u201d he told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday night.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, sounded almost pained on social media as Trump and Musk volleyed insults at each other, sharing a photo composite of the two men and writing, \"But \u2026 I really like both of them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWho else really wants @elonmusk and @realDonaldTrump to reconcile?\u201d Lee posted, later adding: \u201cRepost if you agree that the world is a better place with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact.\u201d",
      "So far, the feud between Trump and Musk is probably best described as a moving target, with plenty of opportunities for escalation or detente.",
      "One person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said Musk wants to speak with Trump, but that the president doesn\u2019t want to do it \u2013 or at least do it on Friday. The person requested anonymity to disclose private matters.",
      "In a series of conversations with television anchors Friday morning, Trump showed no interest in burying the hatchet. Asked on ABC News about reports of a potential call between him and Musk, the president responded: \u201cYou mean the man who has lost his mind?\u201d",
      "Trump added in the ABC interview that he was \u201cnot particularly\u201d interested in talking to Musk at the moment.",
      "Still, others remained hopeful that it all would blow over.",
      "\u201cI grew up playing hockey and there wasn\u2019t a single day that we played hockey or basketball or football or baseball, whatever we were playing, where we didn\u2019t fight. And then we\u2019d fight, then we\u2019d become friends again,\u201d Hannity said on his show Thursday night.",
      "Acknowledging that it \u201cgot personal very quick,\u201d Hannity nonetheless added that the rift was \u201cjust a major policy difference.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson projected confidence that the dispute would not affect prospects for the tax and border bill.",
      "\u201cMembers are not shaken at all,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass this legislation on our deadline.\u201d",
      "He added that he hopes Musk and Trump reconcile, saying \u201cI believe in redemption\u201d and \u201cit's good for the party and the country if all that's worked out.\u201d",
      "But he also had something of a warning for the billionaire entrepreneur.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, do not doubt and do not second-guess and don\u2019t ever challenge the president of the United States, Donald Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \"He is the leader of the party. He\u2019s the most consequential political figure of this generation and probably the modern era.\u201d",

      "Home decor's got a split personality this year: Call it \u201ccity glow\u201d and \u201ccottage flow.\u201d",
      "At the two international design fairs that I attended \u2014 Maison et Objet in France, Ambiente in Germany \u2014 acres of exhibition booths were full of Art Deco furnishings, island-vibe rattan seating and lighting, and lots of emphasis on sustainably produced materials.",
      "But a couple of aesthetics drawing crowds were especially interesting.",
      "One was an exuberant urban vibe I\u2019m nicknaming \u201ccity glow.\u201d It\u2019s full of highlighter-hued throw pillows, edgy surrealism, street art and hefty, Brutalist-style furniture \u2014 lots of sharp-cornered steel or concrete consoles and lamps that loomed over rooms \u2014 as well as rugs and wallcoverings covered in graffiti-style motifs or swaths of vibrant color.",
      "Gretchen Rivera, an interior designer in Washington, D.C., sees it as a look that resonates especially with \u201cyounger generations who grew up with digital influences. There\u2019s surrealist art, energetic colors and playful, almost toy-like design.\u201d",
      "Interior designer Anton Liakhov in Nice, France, agrees: \u201cFor a generation clamoring for creativity and self-expression, it\u2019s loud and in-your-face.\u201d",
      "For surface colors, look at Benjamin Moore\u2019s spicy orange Bryce Canyon or the bubblegum-pink Springtime Bloom. Daydream Apothecary has a whole collection of neon wall paints for intrepid decorators.",
      "Sisters Ana and Lola S\u00e1nchez use art as a bold form of self-expression at their luxe brand Oliver Gal, in South Florida. It's known for its handcrafted, statement-making pieces \u2014 including large acrylic gummy bears, graphic surfboards and wall art inspired by fashion, pop culture and modern surrealism. The result is a vibrant, edgy aesthetic.",
      "A new collection, Rococo Pop, introduces rococo-inspired frames in high-gloss acrylics paired with playful graphic imagery. \u201cWe wanted to take the opulence of 18th century rococo,\u201d notes Ana S\u00e1nchez, \u201cand give it a cheeky, pop-art punch.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese frames are like little rebels in ballgowns \u2014 elegant, over-the-top and totally unexpected,\u201d adds Lola S\u00e1nchez.",
      "The style, her sister says, \u201ccelebrates contrast. Old World charm meets modern mischief.\u201d",
      "The other impressive decor style at the design fairs was very different from the urban look. I\u2019m calling this one \u201ccottage flow,\u201d and Liakhov describes it as evoking a \u201cpeaceful sanctuary, where you can play around with textures that are anchored in, and in tune with, nature.\u201d",
      "Think nubby woolen throws in mossy hues. Softly burnished wooden tables. Vintage quilts, and dishware. Gingham and garden florals. Landscape prints. Imagery of birds and woodland animals on textiles and wallcoverings.",
      "Etsy\u2019s 2025 spring/summer trend report showed that searches for \u201cFrench cottage decor\u201d were up over 26,000% compared to 2024.",
      "\u201cI see people embracing a slower pace to life where they can,\u201d says New York-based interior and decor designer Kathy Kuo about the country cottage style.",
      "\u201cThe past two decades or so were dominated by a glorification of fast-paced \u2018hustle culture\u2019 \u2014 trends like cottagecore and coastal grandmother are evidence that the pendulum\u2019s swinging toward taking pleasure in simpler, more nature-adjacent things in life, whether or not you actually live in a country cottage,\u201d she says.",
      "Paint colors are also reflecting the trend. A calming sage green called Quietude is HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams\u2019 color of the year. Little-Greene\u2019s collection has names like Rolling Fog, Tea with Florence and Hammock.",
      "Watching design show visitors excitedly discovering new finds among the aisles, I thought THIS is what\u2019s fun about home decorating: You can think as creatively as you like when it comes to your own home.",
      "You\u2019re all about high-octane city nightlife? Come this way.",
      "Scottish crofts, Scandi cabins and cozy porches more your thing? Right over here.",
      "And if you want to mix these two aesthetics? Go for it. There\u2019s space to blend elements of both, says Kuo.",
      "\u201cDesign trends are so fluid. I absolutely see the potential to merge these into each other,\u201d she says. \u201cMany city dwellers love time in nature and have an affinity for a more rustic look, while still feeling called to honor their urban environment in their home. I see plenty of modern interior design motifs that are sleek and urban on the surface, but in the details, they\u2019re infused with organic textures and biophilic elements.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, the best designs are the ones that are personal, rather than perfect,\u201d she adds.",
      "You could display an array of contemporary glass bowls on a curvy walnut credenza. Mix botanical patterns in vibrant, unexpected colors. Soften room elements like a sleek table and industrial-style lamp with boucle or velvet cushions and a fluffy rug. Pair polished concrete floors with vintage-inspired wallcovering.",
      "If you don\u2019t want to mix elements in one space, consider using sliding partitions from one room to another. You\u2019ll create a little style \u201cjourney.\u201d",
      "If the recent international design fairs are any indication, you\u2019re going to find loads of fun home decor in stores over the coming months. Get ready to flow.",

      "The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s staffers was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon watchdog is looking into whether any of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's aides was asked to delete Signal messages that may have shared sensitive military information with a reporter, according to two people familiar with the investigation and documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The inspector general's request focuses on how information about the March 15 airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen was shared on the messaging app.",
      "This comes as Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Congress next week for the first time since his confirmation hearing. He is likely to face questions under oath not only about his handling of sensitive information but also the wider turmoil at the Pentagon following the departures of several senior aides and an internal investigation over information leaks.",
      "Hegseth already has faced questions over the installation of an unsecured internet line in his office that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols and revelations that he shared details about the military strikes in multiple Signal chats.",
      "One of the chats included his wife and brother, while the other included President Donald Trump\u2019s top national security officials and inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.",
      "Neither the Pentagon nor the inspector general\u2019s office immediately responded to Friday requests for comment on the investigation.",
      "Besides finding out whether anyone was asked to delete Signal messages, the inspector general also is asking some past and current staffers who were with Hegseth on the day of the strikes who posted the information and who had access to his phone, according to the two people familiar with the investigation and the documents reviewed by the AP. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans have said that the information Hegseth posted to the Signal chats before the military jets had reached their targets could have put those pilots' lives at risk and that for any lower-ranking members of the military it would have led to their firing.",
      "Hegseth has said none of the information was classified. Multiple current and former military officials have said there is no way details with that specificity, especially before a strike took place, would have been OK to share on an unsecured device.",
      "\u201cI said repeatedly, nobody is texting war plans,\u201d Hegseth told Fox News Channel in April after reporting emerged about the chat that included his family members. \u201cI look at war plans every day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear that Hegseth continues to have his support, saying during a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia that the defense secretary \u201cwent through a lot\u201d but \u201che's doing really well.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has limited his public engagements with the press since the Signal controversy. He has yet to hold a Pentagon press briefing, and his spokesman has briefed reporters there only once.",
      "The inspector general is investigating Hegseth at the request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.",
      "Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked and is not approved for carrying classified information. On March 14, one day before the strikes against the Houthis, the Defense Department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of the app.",
      "Trump has said his administration targeted the Houthis over their \u201cunrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.\u201d He has noted the disruption Houthi attacks caused through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt\u2019s Suez Canal.",
      "The Houthi rebels attacked more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, between November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aimed at ending the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

      "NEW DELHI -- India has granted a key license to Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink, bringing the satellite provider a step closer to launching its commercial internet services in the country, a top Indian government official said on Friday.",
      "\u201cYes. License has been granted,\u201d said the official with direct knowledge of the matter at the department of telecommunications. The official declined to be identified because the information isn't public.",
      "The approval comes at a time when Musk is embroiled in a public spat with U.S. President Donald Trump, which threatens billions of dollars' worth in contracts between Starlink and the U.S. government.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February, when the two discussed the company's long-delayed plans for India.",
      "In March, Starlink signed agreements with India\u2019s top two telecom operators -- Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel -- to bring the U.S. satellite internet giant\u2019s services to the world\u2019s most populous country.",
      "At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous rural areas.",
      "The department of telecommunications recently approved a similar license for Reliance Jio, the country\u2019s biggest telecom service provider owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani.",
      "The next phase for Musk\u2019s company would be to secure a separate approval from India\u2019s space regulator and secure airwaves used for telecommunications from the government, which may take at least a couple of months.",
      "The company would also need to showcase through testing and trials that it meets local security rules which it has agreed to while securing the license.",
      "But the biggest challenge Musk\u2019s company faces is pricing as mobile data in India is among the world\u2019s cheapest. Ambani\u2019s Jio once even provided it for free with mobile plans.",
      "Starlink operates the world\u2019s largest satellite constellation with over 6,750 satellites currently orbiting Earth to provide low-latency broadband, including to areas where internet previously has been completely unavailable.",

      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren\u2019t satisfied. They\u2019re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",

      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz says he found President Donald Trump open to discussion and is convinced that Washington remains committed to the NATO alliance",
      "BERLIN -- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, a day after meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, that he encountered a U.S. administration open to discussion and returned confident that Washington remains committed to NATO.",
      "Merz described his Oval Office meeting and extended lunch with Trump as constructive but also candid, noting that the two leaders expressed different views on Ukraine.",
      "\"Yesterday, in the meeting at the Oval Office, I expressed a distinctly different position on the topic of Ukraine than the one Trump had taken, and not only was there no objection, but we discussed it in detail again over lunch,\" Merz said in Berlin after his return.",
      "Thursday\u2019s White House meeting marked the first time the two sat down in person. Merz, who became chancellor in May, avoided the kind of confrontations in the Oval Office that have tripped up other world leaders, including Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South Africa\u2019s Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "The two leaders opened with pleasantries. Merz presented Trump with a gold-framed birth certificate of the president\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, who emigrated from Kallstadt, Germany. Trump called Merz a \u201cvery good man to deal with.\u201d",
      "The American administration, he said, is open to discussion, listens, and is willing to accept differing opinions.",
      "Add he added that dialogue should go both ways: \u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about Donald Trump with a raised finger and wrinkled nose. You have to talk with him, not about him.\"",
      "He said he also met with senators on Capitol Hill, urging them to recognize the scale of Russian rearmament.",
      "\u201cPlease take a look at how far Russia\u2019s armament is going, what they are currently doing there; you obviously have no idea what\u2019s happening,\u201d he said he told them. \u201cIn short, you can talk to them, but you must not let yourself be intimidated. I don\u2019t have that inclination anyway.\u201d",
      "Merz, who speaks English fluently, stressed the need for transatlantic trust and said he reminded Trump that allies matter.",
      "\u201cWhether we like it or not, we will remain dependent on the United States of America for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you also need partners in the world, and the Europeans, especially the Germans, are the best-suited partners.",
      "\u201cThis is the difference between authoritarian systems and democracies: authoritarian systems have subordinates. Democracies have partners \u2014 and we want to be those partners in Europe and with America.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that the U.S. remains committed to NATO, particularly as Germany and others boost their defense spending. Trump has in the past suggested that the U.S. might abandon its commitments to the alliance if member countries don\u2019t meet defense spending targets.",
      "\u201cI have absolutely no doubt that the American government is committed to NATO, especially now that we\u2019ve all said we\u2019re doing more. We\u2019re ensuring that we can also defend ourselves in Europe, and I believe this expectation was not unjustified,\" Merz said.",
      "\"We\u2019ve been the free riders of American security guarantees for years, and we\u2019re changing that now.\u201d",

      "A Japanese court has ruled former executives at the utility managing the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were not accountable for the 2011 meltdown crisis and do not need to pay damages to the company",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese court ruled former executives at the utility managing the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were not accountable for the 2011 meltdown crisis and do not need to pay damages to the company.",
      "The Tokyo High Court ruling on Friday reversed a lower court decision in 2022 ordering four former executives of the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings to pay 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) to the company, saying they had failed to take the utmost safety precautions despite knowing the risks of a serious accident in a major tsunami.",
      "A magitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 destroyed key cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing its three reactors to melt down, spreading large amounts of radiation in the area and keeping tens of thousands of residents from returning home due to radioactive contamination and other safety concerns.",
      "The Tokyo District Court ruling three years ago was the only ruling that held the former TEPCO liable for the Fukushima disaster. It upheld the plaintiffs' argument that the executives had neglected to heed experts\u2019 long-term tsunami predictions and failed to take adequate tsunami precaution measures soon enough.",
      "The court said, however, the long-term tsunani prediction was not considered pressing data requiring immediate tsunami measures and it was understandable the executives had no sense of urgency from the data they had at that time, Kyodo News reported.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling is a major disappointment for Fukushima residents and anti-nuclear activists seeking the managements\u2019 responsibility in nuclear safety.",
      "Plaintiffs and their lawyers criticized the ruling as \u201cunjust\u201d and said they planned to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "Hiroyuki Kawai, a plaintiffs' lawyer, criticized the ruling as \u201clogically flawed,\" saying it means nobody can be held liable for any safety negligence because tsunami and earthquake predictions are still impossible today.",
      "A group of more than 40 TEPCO shareholders filed the lawsuit in 2012 demanding five former executives pay the company 22 trillion yen ($153 billion) in damages. The amount of the 2022 ruling against four of the executives was the highest ever ordered in a lawsuit.",
      "Japan's top court in March found two former TEPCO executives not guilty of negligence over the Fukushima meltdowns, saying a tsunami of the magnitude that hit the plant was unforeseeable. It was the only criminal trial related to the nuclear accident and the only criminal case related to the nuclear accident.",

      "A federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University.",
      "Trump's proclamation, issued Wednesday, was the latest attempt by his administration to prevent the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who accounts for much of Harvard\u2019s research and scholarship.",
      "Harvard filed a legal challenge the next day, asking for a judge to block Trump\u2019s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard\u2019s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order.",
      "A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump\u2019s Wednesday proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury\u201d before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit.",
      "Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration's previous attempt to end Harvard's enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump\u2019s order this week invoked a different legal authority.",
      "If Trump\u2019s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to come to Harvard's campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms.",
      "\u201cHarvard\u2019s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders \u2014 and their dependents \u2014 have become pawns in the government\u2019s escalating campaign of retaliation,\u201d Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing.",
      "While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni.",
      "\u201cEach of us is part of a truly global university community,\u201d Garber said Thursday. \u201cWe know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.\u201d",
      "Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today.",
      "As those students wait to find out if they'll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options.",
      "Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump's crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation's top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of \u201cwoke\u201d and antisemitic viewpoints.",
      "Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",
      "Trump's administration has also taken steps to withhold federal funding from Harvard and other elite colleges that have rejected White House demands related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard's $53 billion endowment allows it to weather the loss of funding for a time, although Garber has warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d to come.",
      "But cutting off students and visiting scholars could hamstring the university's research and global standing.",

      "Insiders have speculated about a potential falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk for months",
      "WASHINGTON -- Maybe it was always going to end this way, with two billionaires angrily posting about each other on social media, fingers flying across pocket-sized screens as their incandescent feud burned hotter by the minute.",
      "But even if the finale was predictable, that didn\u2019t make it any less shocking. After long months when Donald Trump and Elon Musk appeared united in their chaotic mission to remake Washington, their relationship imploded this week like a star going supernova.",
      "It began with Musk complaining about the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda, which the president at first took in stride. Eventually Trump let slip that he was disappointed in his former adviser, prompting Musk to unleash a flood of insults and taunts.",
      "He accused Trump of betraying promises to cut federal spending, shared a suggestion that the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about his association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Perhaps most viciously, Musk insisted that Trump wouldn\u2019t have won last year\u2019s election without his help.",
      "Trump, not one to slouch from a fight, could hold back no longer. He posted that Musk had been \u201cwearing thin,\u201d that he had \u201casked him to leave\u201d his administration, that the tech titan had \u201cgone CRAZY.\u201d",
      "Maybe, Trump threatened, he should save taxpayer money by canceling government contracts and subsidies for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "On and on it went, as liberals savored the spectacle of their most despised political opponents clawing at each other's digital throats and conservatives reeled at the prospect of having to pick sides. Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur and conspiracy theorist, saw an opportunity to position herself as the voice of reason.",
      "\u201cThis fight should be taken offline,\u201d she said \u2014 on social media, of course.",
      "The question now is whether Trump and Musk find some way to step back from a battle that is tearing apart one of the most consequential relationships in modern American politics. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s little telling how far the fallout could spread from a collision between the world\u2019s most powerful man and its wealthiest.",
      "At stake are the future of Musk's companies, including electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX; government programs that rely on the billionaire entrepreneur's technology; legislation for advancing tax cuts and Trump's other priorities in Congress; Republican chances in next year's midterm elections; and an entire political ecosystem that has orbited around Trump and Musk's deteriorating partnership.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like India and Pakistan,\u201d said Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, referring to two nuclear-armed nations that recently skirmished along their border. \u201cIt just escalates and neither one of them seem to back down and understand the strength of each other.\u201d",
      "Trump and Musk were always an odd pairing, with contrasting world views and deep generational and stylistic differences.",
      "Trump, 78, comes from old-school New York real estate and never appears in public without a suit and tie unless he's on the golf course. Before running for president, he became a household name as a reality television star.",
      "Musk, 53, is an immigrant from South Africa who struck it rich in Silicon Valley. In addition to running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk owns the social media company X. He's fashioned himself as a black-clad internet edgelord, and his wealth vastly outstrips Trump's.",
      "But Trump and Musk are kindred spirits in other ways. They're experts at generating attention who enjoy stirring the pot by riling up their opponents. Each has sought more power to accomplish existential quests. Trump assails the federal \u201cdeep state\u201d that resisted him during his first term, while Musk warns about the country going bankrupt from excessive spending and promotes an interplanetary future powered by his rocket technology.",
      "Musk endorsed Trump after the Republican candidate was nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he began spending millions to support him. His social media megaphone was a powerful addition to Trump's comeback campaign, magnifying his efforts to court tech leaders and young, very online men.",
      "Trump rarely tolerates sharing the spotlight, but he seemed enamored with his powerful backer, mentioning him in stump speeches and welcoming him onstage at rallies.",
      "After the election, Musk was a fixture around Mar-a-Lago, posing for photos with Trump's family, joining them for dinner, sitting in on meetings. Instead of growing tired of his \u201cfirst buddy,\u201d Trump made plans to bring Musk along to Washington, appointing him to lead a cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Musk tried to establish himself as the president's omniscient and omnipresent adviser. He held court in Cabinet meetings, slept over in the Lincoln Bedroom and helped himself to caramel ice cream from the White House kitchen.",
      "The federal bureaucracy practically trembled before Musk, who oversaw layoffs and downsizing with his team of acolytes and engineers embedded in various agencies.",
      "Musk appeared thrilled at his opportunity to tinker with the government and exulted in his bromance with Trump, posting on Feb. 7 that he loved the president \u201cas much as a straight man can love another man.\u201d",
      "Trump returned the favor on March 11, allowing Musk to line up Tesla vehicles on the White House driveway as his company was struggling with declining sales. Trump made a show of choosing a cherry red electric car for himself.",
      "But cracks were emerging, especially as Trump pursued tariffs that could raise costs for Musk's businesses. Musk said Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, was \u201ctruly a moron\" and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks\" on April 8.",
      "The billionaire entrepreneur, who had never before worked in public service, seemed to be souring on government. He suggested there wasn't enough political will, either in Congress or in the White House, to adequately reduce spending.",
      "Trump started signaling that it was time for him to leave even though Musk said he would be willing to stay.",
      "Shortly before announcing his departure, Musk said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by legislation that Trump called the \u201cbig beautiful bill\" because it would increase the deficit. The measure includes tax cuts, more money for border security and changes to Medicaid that would leave fewer people with health insurance.",
      "\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d",
      "The criticism didn't prevent Trump from giving Musk a send-off in the Oval Office, where he presented his outgoing adviser with a ceremonial key.",
      "\u201cElon is really not leaving,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be back and forth.\u201d",
      "Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president.\"",
      "It's hard to imagine that now.",
      "Musk escalated his attacks on the legislation Tuesday, calling it a \u201cdisgusting abomination,\" and Trump tried to fend off the criticism.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that will be next,\u201d the president said Thursday in the Oval Office during a meeting with the German chancellor.",
      "It was.",
      "Musk quickly took to X to vent his anger at Trump, saying his tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and accusing him of lying. He also said it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d that the legislation would eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Trump fired back in real time as he tried to maintain momentum for his legislation, which faces a difficult debate in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,\u201d the president posted. \u201cThis is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, some of Trump's allies plotted revenge.",
      "Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who hosts an influential conservative podcast, said the president should direct the U.S. government to seize SpaceX. He also encouraged Trump to investigate allegations that Musk uses drugs and \u201cgo through everything about his immigration status\" in preparation for potential deportation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how good Elon Musk takes a little of that pressure,\" Bannon said, \"because I happen to think a little of that pressure might be coming.\u201d",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The school graduation season is the busiest time of year for the Walmart workers who hand-decorate cakes per customers\u2019 orders",
      "NEW YORK -- Inside a Walmart store in New Jersey, a worker puts the finishing touches on a cake with an edible ink Sponge Bob on top. A colleague creates a buttercream rosette border for a different cake, while another co-worker frosts a tier of what will be a triple-deck dessert.",
      "It\u2019s graduation season, the busiest time of year for the 6,200 employees the nation's largest retailer trained to hand-decorate cakes per customers' orders. The cakes themselves come, pre-made, frozen and in a variety of shapes and sizes, from suppliers, not Walmart's in-store bakeries.",
      "But there\u2019s no sugar-coating the importance the company places on its custom cake business. Its army of icing artisans are the highest paid hourly workers in a typical U.S. Walmart, excluding managers. Cake decorators earn an average of $19.25 per hour, compared with $18.25 for all non-managerial store workers, a company spokesperson said.",
      "Melissa Fernandez, 36, started working in the electronics area and then the wireless services department of the Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey, before she transferred to the deli area in search of better pay. But Fernandez had her eye on a cake decorating job and after spending two months getting trained by a store colleague, she picked up a piping bag full-time in 2021.",
      "\u201cI love baking at home. I love painting,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI love doing anything artistic, and I just always wanted to be a part of it.\u201d After 11 years with Walmart, she said she now makes about $24.40 an hour.",
      "Despite their elite status within Walmart, the retailer's cake decorators have attracted detractors on social media. The company promotes its personalized baked goods on TikTok and encourages the workers behind such creations to do the same. Critics have accused Walmart decorators of stealing ideas and undercutting the work of professional cake artists with their low-priced products.",
      "After TikTok videos praising Walmart's $25 heart-shaped cakes with borders that resemble vintage lace cropped up before Valentine's Day this year, a few bakers produced their own videos explaining why their cakes cost so much more and critiquing Walmart's.",
      "Debates ensued in the comments sections over whether Walmart represented evils of capitalism or served the needs of the masses.",
      "A customized sheet cake that can be sliced to serve 96 people costs $59 at Walmart, about one-third to half the price that a nationwide sample of independent bakeries list online for similarly sized cakes. For $5.20 more, Walmart customers can add strawberry or \u201cBavarian creme\" fillings, which like the bare cakes, are vendor-supplied.",
      "The slice of the celebratory occasion cake market Walmart holds appears vast based on company-supplied figures. One out of four cakes sold in the U.S. comes from Walmart, and its employees will collectively decorate more than 1 million cakes during May and June, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "The number of cakes decorated each day at the location where Fernandez works nearly doubles to 50-60 when school graduations come around, compared to 30-35 a day during the rest of the year, said Michael DeMarco, the manager of the store's fresh food department. He credits the decorators' talent and promotional efforts on TikTok.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting a lot of repeat customers. We\u2019re doing a lot more business because of just the viral sensations,\u201d DeMarco said.",
      "A TikTok video that showed Fernandez designing a $24 version of a customized bouquet cake \u2014 12 cupcakes that are individually decorated and arranged to look like a bunch of flowers \u2014 received nearly a half-million views. The bouquet design was one of the North Bergen store's most popular cakes last month, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The dressy heart-shaped cakes, as well as cakes that resemble meals like sushi or a pile of spaghetti and meatballs, are popular too, she said. Fernandez also has created \u201cburn away\u201d cakes: an iced cake topped with an image printed on paper, which is set ablaze to reveal a different image underneath.",
      "\u201cTikTok helps me stay up to date,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of trends that I see on there, within that week or within that month, customers will come asking about it. And we\u2019re pretty up to date as well.\u201d",
      "Jazzing up a cake by hand requires skill, whether or not someone else did the baking, she said. Funneling buttercream frosting through a bag and various sized piping tips to yield the desired design without misplaced blobs is not the same as drawing or painting, Fernandez explained.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure points that you have to practice in order to get the borders correct and the right thickness or the right texture,\u201d she said.",
      "Tiffany Witzke, who has been a Walmart cake decorator since July 2016 and works at a store in Springfield, Missouri, has more than 912,000 followers on TikTok. The job attracts people who \"can be extremely skilled and talented,\u201d Witzke said, adding that customers want increasingly complicated designs.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started, it was basically just borders and writing,\" she said. \u201cNow, everybody wants more and more and more on their cake.\u201d",
      "Liz Berman, owner of The Sleepy Baker, in Natick, Massachusetts, said she's not worried about losing customers to Walmart because of her attention to detail and the premium ingredients she uses.",
      "She charges $205 and up for a half-sized sheet cake, the bouquets made up of two dozen miniature cupcakes cost $110. All the cakes are made from scratch, and Berman said she designs everything herself.",
      "\u201cIt's just a totally different business model,\" she said. \u201cEverything I do is custom.\u201d",
      "For Walmart, the cake decorating business delivers higher profit margins than some other areas, such as groceries and electronics, according to Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana. But it's also resonating with shoppers looking for affordable luxuries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gone into a period where the consumer is saying, \u2018This is good enough,\u2019\" Cohen said.",
      "Customers interviewed at the North Bergen store on a recent weekday seemed to be satisfied. George Arango, 34, picked up two customized cakes, one to celebrate a co-worker's retirement and the other for a colleague getting another job. After researching prices on various store websites, he decided to give Walmart a try.",
      "\u201cThe price is fantastic,\" he said. \"I\u2019m walking out with two cakes for $40.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The legal aid group Lambda Legal has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified",
      "NEW YORK -- The nonprofit legal aid group Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified",
      "Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings announced the results on Thursday, saying the group exceeded its original fundraising goal by $105 million.",
      "\u201cI think this is a statement by the LGBTQ+ community that we will not go back,\u201d said Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings in an interview.",
      "The nonprofit has won court cases that ended bans on gay marriage in 2015 and that abolished laws that criminalized sex between gay adults in 2003. It launched the fundraising campaign quietly in 2022 in response to a wave of bills in state legislatures that targeted LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Some of those laws sought to limit the discussion of sexuality and gender in schools, remove books featuring LGBTQ+ characters from school libraries, ban public drag shows, prohibit students from using their preferred pronouns and limit access to gender-affirming care for trans youth.",
      "This year, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has focused on transgender people. It has ordered trans people to leave the military, sought to remove fair housing protections for them and denied the existence of trans, nonbinary and intersex people through an executive order recognizing only two sexes.",
      "Trump has tried to cut federal funding for any gender-affirming medical care for trans children.",
      "Lambda Legal has brought multiple legal cases against the administration, including challenges to its ban on trans members in the military and on gender-affirming care for trans youth.",
      "Lambda Legal is a large nonprofit, spending more than $20 million annually since 2021 and holding assets exceeding $54 million in 2023, according to its tax filing.",
      "But the scale of this campaign significantly increases its resources.",
      "Jennings said since its founding in 1973, Lambda Legal had received three gifts of over $1 million. In this campaign, 14 individuals, two foundations and one law firm gave at least $1 million, with several giving tens of millions, he said.",
      "\u201cIt was really individuals in the community who stepped up and made this campaign happen,\" he said. \"It wasn\u2019t corporations. It wasn\u2019t law firms. It wasn\u2019t foundations.\u201d",
      "Among the donors is billionaire author MacKenzie Scott, who gave the nonprofit gifts in 2020 and 2021. The largest gift, $25 million, came from the Kathryn G. Graham Trust. Graham served as an early board member for Lambda Legal.",
      "Some $80 million of the raised funds will be spent in the next five years, with the remaining $205 million pledged by donors in their estates, often called planned gifts.",
      "Lambda Legal will use the infusion of cash to hire more attorneys, set up a new mechanism to coordinate pro bono representation from major law firms and hold public trainings about the rights of LGBTQ+ people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every battle,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every fight, but we\u2019re going to fight every fight and we will keep fighting and we will be able to keep fighting because of this campaign until we eventually win.\u201d",
      "Even with this new fundraising push, Lambda Legal's resources still fall short of the funding that has gone to conservative nonprofits that also use litigation to pursue public policy goals. For example, Alliance Defending Freedom has raised more than $100 million in each 2022 and 2023, according to its tax filings. The group has represented female athletes challenging sports participation by transgender women and girls and has challenged laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",
      "The acceptance and visibility of gay, trans, intersex and gender queer people has transformed dramatically within the living memory of many Americans.",
      "In 1961, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1972. But fights for equal treatment across social arenas and to protect against discrimination continued for decades.",
      "Two major Supreme Court decisions in the past 25 years reflect a rapid shift in public attitudes to support the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The first in 2003 struck down sodomy laws that criminalized sex between gay adults and the second, in 2015, eliminated bans on gay marriage.",
      "Marc Stein, a historian and professor at San Francisco State University, attributed those and other wins to the LGBTQ+ movements' mobilization, court-based strategies and direct protests.",
      "He also said over decades, the fundraising base of the movement changed significantly. In the 1950s and 60s, the movement largely was supported by its members.",
      "\u201cOne main source was that they published magazines and newsletters and had subscribers and had members that paid membership fees,\u201d Stein said, though some wealthy patrons also offered support. By the 1980s, the movement began pushing wealthy donors to give to LGBTQ+ causes, he said.",
      "\u201cI think there was a real change in that period from funding that kept the movement close to the community,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAnd then developments that led some, especially national organizations, to move away from the model of grassroots fundraising to a model of corporate and business fundraising.\u201d",
      "Now, numerous Pride events around the country \u2014 including San Francisco and New York City \u2014 are reporting budget shortfalls because corporate sponsors have withdrawn their support. Some experts say the corporate retreat from brand activism, which peaked between 2016 to 2022, is due to a changing cultural landscape and a growing number of consumers who don\u2019t want companies to take positions on social issues.",
      "Jennings of Lambda Legal noted the recent withdrawal of corporate money from supporting LGBTQ+ groups and credited his group's recent fundraising success to its individual donors, many of whom he said were motivated to prevent a rollback on the rights that had been won in their lifetimes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of cowardice on the part of corporate America right now. A lot of people, who two years ago couldn\u2019t wait to slap a rainbow on their logo, are no longer writing checks,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cI think Lambda turned to the community and the community responded. And sadly, corporate America, which a lot of groups have relied on, has given up the fight in some cases.\u201d",

      "Members of Congress and a federal judge are questioning the Trump administration\u2019s plan to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide",
      "Members of Congress and a federal judge are questioning the Trump administration's plan to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide and halt a residential career training program for low-income youth that was established more than 50 years ago.",
      "The Department of Labor last week announced a nationwide \u201cpause of operations\u201d for dozens of Job Corps centers run by private contractors. The department cited an internal review that concluded the program was costly and had a low success rate.",
      "The review also identified safety issues at the residential campuses. The Department of Labor said it would transition students and staff out of the locations by June 30.",
      "The program was designed for teenagers and young adults who struggled to finish high school in traditional school settings and then go on to obtain training and find jobs. Participants received tuition-free housing, meals and health care.",
      "Critics have argued that closing the campuses would leave young people homeless and deprive them of opportunities and hope. They also maintained the Trump administration did not have legal authority to suspend Job Corps because it was created by Congress.",
      "Lawmakers asked Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer about the decision when she appeared before the House Education and Workforce Committee on Thursday.",
      "\u201cJob Corps, which you know has bipartisan support in Congress, trains young, low-income people, and helps them find good-paying jobs and provides housing for a population that might otherwise be without a home,\u201d U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott said.",
      "Scott, a Virginia Democrat, read from a letter Chavez-DeRemer wrote in support of Job Corps last year. The letter said the program increased participants' employment and wages, and decreased their reliance on public benefits.",
      "\u201cYou've made a starkly abrupt shift from a champion to a destroyer of this important program,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, adding that students in her district were distraught.",
      "In response, Chavez-DeRemer said she recognized that only an act of Congress could eliminate Job Corps. She said the Labor Department had instead used its authority to halt the program's operations but planned to comply with a federal court order that temporarily blocked the action.",
      "U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter of New York issued a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that prohibited the Labor Department from terminating jobs, removing students from the 99 contractor-run centers or eliminating the Job Corps program without congressional authorization.",
      "The order was sought as part of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the National Job Corps Association, a trade group which includes business, labor, volunteer and community organizations. The group alleged the Labor Department's decision would have disastrous consequences, including displacing tens of thousands of vulnerable young people and forcing mass layoffs.",
      "During Thursday's House committee hearing, Scott asked several Job Corps students in attendance to stand.",
      "\u201cThese students were on their way to getting a good job and earning a living wage. On behalf of them, I urge you to immediately reverse the decision to effectively shut down all Job Corps centers,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer responded that the Trump administration wanted to eliminate ineffective training interventions. The report released in April by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration said Job Corps operated at a $140 million deficit during the last fiscal year and had an average graduation rate of under 39%.",
      "\u201cOur recently released Job Corps transparency report showed that in 2023 alone, more than 14,000 serious incidents were reported at the Job Corps centers, including cases of sexual assault, physical violence, and drug use,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said. \u201cThis program is failing to deliver safe and successful outcomes our young people deserve.\u201d",
      "The National Job Corps Association maintained the statistics were misleading. It said the 14,000 serious incidents included power outages, inclement weather, athletic injuries that required treatment and adult students leaving campus without prior approva.",
      "The group also said that Job Corps' graduation rates have historically been above 60%, but were depressed by COVID-19 policies during the year the Labor Department reviewed.",
      "Seth Harris, senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University, said in an interview that Job Corps is wildly popular on Capitol Hill. He recalled having to slow down Job Corps due to funding challenges when he served as acting secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cI got angry calls from elected members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Harris said.",
      "The Job Corps program was designed to help young people who were not succeeding in school or who had left school without a place to go, placing them in a residential setting outside their community and providing them with vocational training, he said.",
      "The Labor Department shutting down Job Corps would be illegal because there\u2019s a process outlined for closing down the centers which includes publishing performance data, justifying the closure and allowing time for public comment and remediation, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is plainly illegal,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut it is entirely on brand for Donald Trump to beat up on poor kids, largely kids of color, who are trying to make their lives better.\u201d",

      "Spirits maker Brown-Forman is reporting weaker sales as it confronts challenging market conditions amid trade conflicts and pinched consumer spending",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown-Forman Corp. reported weaker sales Thursday as the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey confronts challenging market conditions amid global trade conflicts and pinched consumer spending.",
      "The Louisville, Kentucky-based spirits giant said its full-year net sales of nearly $4 billion were down 5% from a year ago, and fell 7% in in the fourth quarter. Net income was down 15% for the full fiscal year and plunged 45% in the fourth quarter ending April 30, the company said.",
      "The quarterly drop came as Brown-Forman and other U.S. spirits producers who rely heavily on foreign sales felt the reverberations from President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plans and consumer anxiety about the economy.",
      "Brown-Forman also offered a sobering assessment for the coming year.",
      "Having steered the company through an \u201cextremely challenging and uncertain operating environment\u201d in the past year, Brown-Forman CEO Lawson Whiting predicted another challenging year ahead.",
      "\u201cFiscal 2025 was a year unlike any other that I\u2019ve seen in the past three decades,\u201d he said during a conference call with industry market analysts.",
      "Whiting pointed to industry figures showing that many consumers are purchasing smaller sizes of spirits. He called it unusual and said it reflects a consumer \u201cwho\u2019s pinched and just goes to the store with a $10 bill instead of $20 and then they get the smaller size.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe consumer and their wallet just doesn\u2019t have as much money in it,\" he said. \"They\u2019re spending money on things like vacations and lodging, and other things like that. But then when it trickles down and they go to the grocery store, I think in some cases, spirits have fallen out of the basket a little bit.\u201d",
      "In its outlook for the next year, the company said the challenges include continued consumer uncertainty and the \u201cpotential impact from currently unknown tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know it's highly volatile,\" Leanne Cunningham, the company\u2019s CFO, said while fielding a question about tariffs during the conference call. \"None of us can predict what\u2019s going on.\"",
      "The company believes the market volatility will \"create sustained levels of consumer uncertainty, which we believe will lead to another year of below historical total distilled spirits trends,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his sweeping tariff plans on his social media platform. Trump hiked nearly all of his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50% on Wednesday in a move that\u2019s set to hammer businesses from automakers to home builders, and likely push up prices for consumers even further.",
      "Brown-Forman executives said Thursday that American spirits brands mostly remain off store shelves in Canada. Trump has angered Canadians with his trade war and calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Spirits makers in Kentucky have expressed fears of becoming \"collateral damage\u201d by getting caught up in trade conflicts.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty of the tariffs continues to weigh down distilleries large and small,\" Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said in a statement Thursday. \"We are urging the Trump administration to help get the spirits sector back to fair and reciprocal trade with zero-for-zero tariffs with our major trading partners.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Brown-Forman's full-year results showed that net sales for its whiskey products were flat. Growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and its Woodford Reserve brand was offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and declines in other super-premium Jack Daniel's products, it said.",
      "The company will launch a new product, Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Blackberry, this summer.",
      "\u201cBlackBerry is a globally recognized, well-established flavor trend, and naturally complements the flavor of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey,\" Whiting said.",
      "In January, Brown-Forman announced it was reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its hometown barrel-making plant in Louisville. Whiting reaffirmed Thursday that those actions are expected to produce about $70 million to $80 million in annualized cost savings.",

      "Jones, who is averaging a team-high 25:45 on the ice in the postseason, played more than 30 minutes in both of the first two games of the series. He scored in the first period on Friday \u2014 his fourth goal of the postseason \u2014 and assisted on Dmitry Kulikov's goal in the second.",
      "\u201cWe came here for a split and got it,\" Jones added, \"and just going to recover now.\u201d",
      "Panthers coach Paul Maurice said heading back to Florida with the series tied \u2014 instead of being down 0-2 \u2014 does make a minor mental difference, but one of his team's strengths is its tunnel vision approach.",
      "\u201cIt's mathematically significant,\" Maurice said. \"I'd like to think that we'd be dragging here today, this morning, if we had lost that game having had the lead for so long. But I think we're really good at cutting it off.",
      "\"It's the same morning this morning at the meal room as it was two days ago (after the Game 1 loss). It's just on to the next day. We understand how to leave our days \u2014 the good ones and the bad ones \u2014 in the past and handle the day we have right now.\u201d",
      "The Oilers are moving forward in the series with an equally short memory after missed chances in Game 2.",
      "Corey Perry, whose goal with 17.8 seconds left in the third period forced overtime, said the back-and-forth nature of the series was to be expected from the two teams, but there's no use in getting hung up on \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to do?\u201d Perry said. \"It\u2019s not going to do anything for you now. Get on the plane tomorrow and get some rest and be ready for Game 3.\u201d",
      "Few players have spent more time on the ice in the series than Connor McDavid. The Edmonton star played 31:12 in Game 1, and just over 35 minutes in Game 2 \u2014 more than anyone else in the game. That's nearly 10 minutes more than his postseason average of 24:22.",
      "McDavid's impact was certainly felt on Friday. He had three assists, including one in which he zipped through Florida's penalty kill to set up Draisaitl\u2019s power play goal in the first.",
      "Draisaitl noted after the game there's only one player in the world that can make such a highlight-reel play, but stressed the importance of using the two days off to recalibrate.",
      "\u201cAt this time of year, you've got to move on,\u201d he said, \u201cThere\u2019s not time thinking about it too long. Obviously it stings right now, but we have to move on.\u201d",

      "When the Oklahoma City Thunder get hit, they tend to hit back",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- When the Oklahoma City Thunder get hit, they tend to hit back. Immediately, too.",
      "Everybody knows what probably is coming in Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Sunday night. The Thunder, down 1-0 in the series with the Indiana Pacers, will be raring to go. That\u2019s been their way all season; the Thunder are 17-2, including the NBA Cup final loss, in the next game after a defeat \u2014 with those 17 wins coming by an average of 17.5 points.",
      "The thing is, the Thunder say that\u2019s the way they play after wins as well.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the trick,\u201d coach Mark Daigneault said Saturday. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be reactive to the last game because then you can be too high after wins, you can be too low after losses. We just get ourselves to neutral. Understand every game is different, every game is unwritten. You go out there, the ball goes up in the air, and the team that competes better on that night wins.\u201d",
      "As such, Oklahoma City will try to be better Sunday. And so will Indiana.",
      "There was much for both teams to clean up after Game 1. For the Pacers, it was too many turnovers. For the Thunder, it was not closing out a game that it led by 15 with less than 10 minutes remaining.",
      "\u201cLook, everybody\u2019s pattern after a loss is to come more aggressively. \u2026 Their whole team is going to be even more aggressive defensively,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cThe challenge for us is to be able to match that.\u201d",
      "Thunder guard and NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 who led all scorers with 38 points in Game 1, his finals debut \u2014 said he doesn't hang on to games for too long, even that one. He watches film, learns the lessons and moves on.",
      "He doesn't expect to deviate from that plan for Game 2.",
      "\u201cI take what I need to take from it, and we do it as a group,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cAfter that, I let it go because the lessons are learned. There\u2019s nothing else you can do.\u201d",
      "The Pacers have an opportunity at something very rare: going up 2-0 in the finals by taking the first two games on the road.",
      "It\u2019s happened only twice in finals history: Chicago did it in 1993 against Phoenix and Houston did it in 1995 against Seattle. Both the Bulls and the Rockets went on to win the NBA title in those seasons.",
      "\u201cI think winning on the road is hard,\u201d said Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, who had the game-winning shot in Game 1 with 0.3 seconds left. \u201cWinning an NBA game is hard, and especially a playoff game, and let alone a finals game, right? It\u2019s not easy. You\u2019re just trying to be as present as you can.\u201d",
      "The Thunder know their odds of winning this title take a serious dive if they lose Game 2 and head to Indianapolis trailing the series 2-0.",
      "So, technically, Sunday isn\u2019t a must-win game. There\u2019s a Game 3 on Wednesday no matter what and a Game 4 on Friday no matter what.",
      "But nobody needs to tell OKC the stakes right now.",
      "\u201cGame 1 was a must-win and we didn\u2019t win. Now we flip to Game 2 and it\u2019s a must-win again,\u201d Thunder forward Chet Holmgren said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in must-win situations in this playoff run, and honestly in the playoffs, every game feels like a must-win. You\u2019re not saving anything in the tank for any games down the line.\u201d",
      "Assuming he scores in Game 2 \u2014 obviously, a reasonable assumption \u2014 Gilgeous-Alexander will join a new club.",
      "The MVP is just two points shy of reaching the 3,000-point mark for the season, including playoffs. (If the NBA Cup final game counted, which it doesn't, he'd already be over 3,000 for the season.)",
      "This will be the 25th time a player has scored 3,000 in a season; Gilgeous-Alexander will be the 12th person to do it. Michael Jordan did it 10 times, Wilt Chamberlain did it five times and nine other players \u2014 Bob McAdoo, Elgin Baylor, James Harden, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Kevin Durant, Kobe Bryant, Luka Doncic, Rick Barry and Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 did it once.",

      "Elon Musk stands to lose billions of dollars in his fight with President Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- The world\u2019s richest man could lose billions in his fight with world\u2019s most powerful politician.",
      "The feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla\u2019s plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.",
      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",
      "Credit sales jumped by a third to $595 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.",
      "If Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that\u2019s far from certain.",
      "Meanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \u201cin a meaningful way.\u201d But he\u2019s now less hopeful.",
      "\u201cThere are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\u201d TD Cowen\u2019s Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \u201cand it\u2019s still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\u201d",
      "Michaeli\u2019s stock target for Tesla earlier this year was $388. He has since lowered it to $330. Tesla was trading Friday at $300.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk\u2019s rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.",
      "The privately held company that is reportedly worth $350 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.",
      "But if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the U.S.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.",
      "Musk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn\u2019t do it.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk\u2019s once-close relationship with the president.",
      "Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.",
      "On Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40% of India\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.",
      "Big advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.",
      "Musk has called their decision to leave an \u201cillegal boycott\u201d and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.",
      "Now advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.",
      "If Trump sours on X, \"there\u2019s a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \u201cexodus isn\u2019t obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\u201d",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",
      "The pledges apply to Amazon's U.K. website. The company said in a statement that it has zero tolerance for fake reviews and that the measures build on Amazon's existing efforts to tackle them.",
      "\u201cWe invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews ever appearing on our store, including on expert human investigators and machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to detect risk,\" the company said.",
      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA",
      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company",
      "Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.",
      "In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.",
      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.",
      "In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.",
      "The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d service in Austin, Texas, this month.",
      "Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d",
      "He added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d",
      "Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.",
      "On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.",
      "One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.",
      "Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.",
      "After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.",
      "After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.",
      "Now investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally \u2014 down $20 billion for the day.",

    "story": [
      "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Cutting off the horns of sedated rhinos with a chainsaw has been viewed by wildlife conservationists in Africa for more than 30 years as a necessary evil to save the iconic endangered species from poaching.",
      "They hoped the drastic action was working, but evidence was scarce.",
      "Now, a study published Thursday in the academic journal Science has found that dehorning rhinos has led to a large reduction in poaching in game reserves in and around the Kruger National Park in northern South Africa \u2014 an area that's home to 25% of the world's rhinos and is especially vulnerable to poaching.",
      "The results of the seven-year study that ended in 2023 are seen as long-awaited evidence that removing rhinos' horns \u2014 which needs to be done every one to two years because they grow back \u2014 helps them survive, even if the animals lose part of their makeup.",
      "The conclusions seem obvious. Lucrative illegal markets in parts of southeast Asia and China crave rhino horns for use in traditional medicines, and removing the rhinos' horns take away what poachers are after.",
      "But Tim Kuiper, a biodiversity scientist at South Africa's Nelson Mandela University and the lead author of the study, said it was new to have long-term data from multiple sites on dehorning rhinos. He said the study, conducted between January 2017 and December 2023, focused on 11 reserves in the Kruger area and compared data from eight that dehorned their rhinos against the three that didn't.",
      "It also analyzed data from the reserves before and after they dehorned their rhinos.",
      "The study showed that dehorning consistently reduced poaching, Kuiper said. It found that the dehorning of more than 2,000 rhinos resulted in a 78% reduction in poaching in those eight reserves, providing some confirmation that such an invasive intervention was worth it.",
      "\u201cIt is a big part of what a rhino is, having a horn,\u201d Kuiper said. \u201cSo having to remove it is kind of a necessary evil, if I can put it that way. But it\u2019s very effective. There\u2019s no doubt it saved hundreds of rhinos' lives.\u201d",
      "South Africa has the largest numbers of black and white rhinos. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya also have significant populations. There are around 17,500 white rhinos and 6,500 black rhinos left in the world, with black rhino numbers reduced from 70,000 in 1970 to less than 2,500 by the time poaching reached a crisis point in the mid-1990s, according to the Save the Rhino organization.",
      "Dehorning rhinos started in southern Africa as early as 1989. It has not been accepted without question.",
      "There has been opposition from animal rights activists but also questions from conservationists over what impact it has on a rhino's wellbeing, and what a future might look like with more hornless rhinos.",
      "Vanessa Duthe, a rhino researcher in South Africa not involved in the study, said rhinos use their horns to defend themselves against predators, to compete for territory and, in the case of black rhinos, to look for food. There is also evidence that dehorned rhinos adjust their movements to live in smaller ranges, she said.",
      "She said conservationists don't know the full impacts of dehorning, but research had found it had no adverse effect on rhinos' breeding rates or mortality rates.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the benefits of dehorning by far outweigh any ecological cost that we\u2019re aware of today,\u201d Duthe said. She said dehorning a rhino now takes around 10 minutes and the process causes minimum distress. Blindfolds and earmuffs are put on sedated rhinos during dehorning, which also provides an opportunity to microchip rhinos and collect samples that aid research.",
      "Conservationists agree that dehorning alone will not end rhino poaching and Kuiper said he saw it as a short-to-mid-term solution. Other efforts like more effective law enforcement and better support for game rangers on the frontline are key.",
      "While South Africa has helped pull rhinos back from the threat of extinction, more than 400 rhinos a year are still killed by poachers in the country.",
      "The dehorning study was a collaboration between scientists from three South African universities, Oxford University in England and game reserve managers and rangers. It also involved the South African National Parks department, the World Wildlife Fund and the Rhino Recovery Fund.",

      "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.",
      "Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "Some wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.",
      "Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "It's kitten season in warm-weather areas and animal shelters need all the help they can get",
      "NEW YORK -- Strawberry, Blueberry, JoJo and Mazzy were about 6 weeks old when animal rescuers coaxed them out of long metal pipes in the parking lot of a storage unit company. Meatball was a single kitten living in a cold garage with a group of semi-feral adult cats.",
      "Spaghetti, Macaroni and Rigatoni, meanwhile, were just 2 weeks old when the good folks of LIC Feral Feeders, a cat rescue in Queens, took them in and bottle-fed them until they were strong enough to survive.",
      "Consider these cuties the face of kitten season 2025.",
      "Kitten season, typically landing during warmer months, is the time of year when most cats give birth. That produces a surge of kittens, often fragile neonates. Shelters get overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the 24-hour care and feeding of extremely young kittens.",
      "That, as a result, triggers a need for more foster homes because many of the 4,000 or so shelters in the U.S. don't have the time or resources for around-the-clock care, said Hannah Shaw, an animal welfare advocate known as the Kitten Lady with more than a million followers on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe see about 1.5 million kittens entering shelters every year. And most of them will come into shelters during May and June,\u201d she said. \u201cShelters need all hands on deck to help out through fostering.\u201d",
      "Familiarity with fostering animals is high, Shaw said. The act of doing it is a different story. There's a false perception, she said, that the expense of fostering animals falls on the people who step up to do it. These days, many shelters and rescues cover the food, supplies and medical costs of fostering.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t foster because they think it\u2019s going to be this huge cost, but fostering actually only costs you time and love,\u201d she said.",
      "Lisa Restine, a Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition veterinarian, said people looking to adopt kittens should take pairs since cats often bond early in life. And how many cats is too many cats per household?",
      "\u201cThis is nothing serious or medical but my general rule of thumb is the number of adults in the house, like a 2-to-1 ratio, because you can carry one cat in each hand, so if there are two adults you can have four cats and still be sane,\u201d she said.",
      "Square footage to avoid territory disputes is a good rule of thumb when planning for cats, Restine said. Two cats per 800 square feet then 200 square feet more for each addition should help, she said.",
      "Littermates, like Macaroni and Rigatoni, are much more likely to bond, Restine said. Kittens not biologically related but raised together often bond as well \u2014 like Meatball and Spaghetti. But adopters hoping to bond an adult cat with a new kitten arrival may be disappointed.",
      "\u201cOnce they're over that 3- or 4-month mark, it's hard to get that true bonding,\u201d Restine said.",
      "Typically, kittens stay in their foster homes from a few weeks to a few months. While statistics are not kept on the number of kitten fosters that \u201cfail\u201d \u2014 when foster families decided to keep their charges \u2014 some shelters report rates as high as 90%. That's a win, despite use of the word \u201cfail,\u201d advocates note.",
      "Shaw sees another barrier holding people back from fostering: the notion that it requires special training or skills. That's why she has dedicated her life to educating the public, offering videos, books and research on how it works at her site kittenlady.org.",
      "Companies are coming on board, too. Hill's, a pet food company, runs the Hill\u2019s Food, Shelter & Love program. It has provided more than $300 million in food support to over 1,000 animal shelters that support fostering in North America.",
      "\u201cAbout a quarter of a million kittens, unfortunately, don\u2019t survive in our shelters every year,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe shelter\u2019s going to be there to mentor and support you. So I think a lot of the fear that people have about fostering, they might find that actually it is something you totally can do. It\u2019s just scary because you haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d",

      "The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo\u2019s popular video-game console",
      "NEW YORK -- The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo's popular video game console.",
      "Even with a hefty $450 price tag, fans around the world, from Japan to the U.S., lined up outside stores to pick up pre-orders or have a chance to buy the device. The release ends months of anticipation that included pre-order hiccups and fears that tariffs would delay the release of the Switch 2.",
      "Here's what to know about the release and where you can buy it.",
      "The Nintendo Switch's unique ability to switch from a handheld console to a traditional one helped make it a hit when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo Switch Lite, which was a handheld-only device released two years later, also became popular, especially during the pandemic. It helped usher in bestselling Nintendo games including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\u201d \u201cMario Kart 8 Deluxe\u201d and \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.\u201d",
      "The Nintendo Switch 2 adds interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. It will also have a more vibrant display and a larger screen.",
      "Nintendo has sold a total of 152 million Switches, just behind its best-selling Nintendo DS console which saw 154 million units move, according to the company. But demand has dwindled for the Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. Nintendo hopes the new console will boost its declining sales.",
      "The base Switch 2 costs $450 and a bundle with the new \u201cMario Kart World\u201d included costs $500. It can be found online and in-store at major retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy, as well as specialty retailers such as GameStop, but it is expected to be snapped up fast and widespread shortages are expected.",
      "The on-again, off-again tariffs ordered by President Trump \u2014 which included goods from Japan \u2014 sparked fears Nintendo might have to delay the device. But the launch comes within the 90-day pause on most tariffs. U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.",
      "When they started in April, high demand sparked a chaotic pre-order process. Scores of consumers trying to pre-order ran into delays or errors.",
      "Shoppers took to social media to share long wait times and screenshots of error messages and carts that suddenly went empty. Nintendo acknowledged the \u201cvery high demand\u201d at the time and said it was working hard to fulfill orders, but also urged people to try to buy the device without a pre-order on June 5.",
      "Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "The company is hoping the device jump-starts its sagging sales. In May Nintendo reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March but promised a turnaround.",

Many of those waiting for the store to open had ordered online, but a few like Huo hoped for a chance at purchasing any extra inventory the store had.",
      "In Japan, the new consoles were sold through a competitive lottery system that Nintendo said got about 2.2 million applications.",
      "Outside the official draw, some retailers offered their own lotteries to pre-order the devices.",
      "Koji Takahashi was among those who missed out on the official draw but he was selected in the second round of a lottery held by a major electronics retailer in Japan.",

Central to its updated system is a new \u201cC\u201d button on its controller, which will launch a \u201cGameChat\u201d feature that requires a subscription to Nintendo\u2019s Switch online service.

      "The Switch 2\u2019s rollout arrives at an uncertain time for much of the gaming industry due to new tariffs implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "The initiative is being launched almost a decade after it was first proposed in 2016, and six years after the initial studies to determine its feasibility.",

      "The Humboldt Cable will establish Chile as a data gateway for the Asia-Pacific, while strengthening its relations with Asian nations, especially China, its largest trading partner. It also comes as demand for undersea cables surges due to increased reliance on cloud computing services.",
      "The next stages involve installing the submarine cable, selecting and contracting a telecommunications operator, and constructing landing stations in Chile.",
      "The initiative could heighten tensions as Chile finds itself caught in the middle of an intensifying rivalry between China and the Trump administration. Undersea cables have long been flash points in geopolitical disputes.",

      "A private lunar lander from Japan has crashed into the moon",
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \"Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.",
      "NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.",

      "Anthropic didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. Reddit filed the lawsuit Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Francisco, where both companies are based.",
      "\u201cAI companies should not be allowed to scrape information and content from people without clear limitations on how they can use that data,\u201d said Ben Lee, Reddit's chief legal officer, in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Reddit has previously entered licensing agreements with Google, OpenAI and other companies to enable them to train their AI systems on Reddit commentary.",

      "Anthropic was formed by former OpenAI executives in 2021 and its flagship Claude chatbot remains a key competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Much like other AI companies, it's relied heavily on websites such as Wikipedia and Reddit that are full of rich sources of written materials to teach an AI assistant the patterns of human language",
      "In a 2021 paper co-authored by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei \u2014 cited in the lawsuit \u2014 researchers at the company identified the subreddits, or subject-matter forums, that contained the highest quality data, such as those focused on gardening, history or thoughts people have in the shower.",
      "Anthropic in 2023 argued in a letter to the U.S. Copyright Office that the \"way Claude was trained qualifies as a quintessentially lawful use of materials,\u201d by making copies of information to perform a statistical analysis of a large body of data.",
      "But Reddit's lawsuit is different from others brought against AI companies because it doesn\u2019t allege copyright infringement. Instead, it focuses on the alleged breach of Reddit's terms of use, and the unfair competition, it says, was created.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer \u2014 charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.",
      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",
      "Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.",
      "Wheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans. Farmers have to throw out any infected grains, which can cause devastating losses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many problems that farmers have to deal with that risks their livelihood,\u201d said David Geiser, a Fusarium expert at Penn State.",
      "Although Jian and Liu are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the country, the fungus is already prevalent in the U.S. \u2014 particularly in the east and Upper Midwest \u2014 and scientists have been studying it for decades.",
      "Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders. Studying the genes of a foreign fungus strain, for example, can help scientists learn how it tolerates heat, resists pesticides or mutates.",
      "\u201cWe look at variations among individuals just like we do humans,\u201d said Nicole Gauthier, a plant pathologist at the University of Kentucky who studies Fusarium.",
      "That said, it\u2019s unclear why the Chinese researchers might have wanted to bring that strain of Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. and why they didn\u2019t fill out the proper paperwork to do so.",

      "When the threat of wildfires has forced power to be cut in the tourist town of Calistoga, California, on the edge of Napa Valley, it\u2019s meant firing up a bank of noisy, polluting diesel generators",
      "CALISTOGA, Calif. -- For residents of this quaint tourist town on the northern edge of Napa Valley, the threat of wildfire is seldom out of mind. The hillside bears burn scars from a 2020 fire that forced all of Calistoga to evacuate, and the 2017 Tubbs fire that killed 22 people in wine country started just a few miles from downtown.",
      "When fire danger required shutting off transmission lines that might spark a blaze, the town relied on a bank of generators in a popular recreation area that belched choking diesel exhaust and rumbled so loudly it drove people away.",
      "But now Calistoga is shifting to a first-of-its-kind system that combines two clean-energy technologies \u2014 hydrogen fuel cells and batteries \u2014 for enough juice to power the city for about two days. Experts say the technology has potential beyond simply delivering clean backup power in emergencies; they say it's a steppingstone to supporting the electric grid any day of the year.",
      "As the system was undergoing its final tests in late May in an area that includes a dog park, ball fields, community garden and bike trail, residents said they were grateful to be guaranteed clean energy year-round. Lisa Gift, a resident who also serves on the city council, noted Calistoga is already grappling with climate change that is fueling more intense and frequent wildfires.",
      "\u201cContinuing to depend on fossil fuels was simply not sustainable,\u201d Gift said. \"That's what excited me about this. It\u2019s a clean and reliable energy solution that ensures the safety and resilience of our community.\u201d",
      "Energy Vault, an energy storage company based in California, built the new facility that was to come online in early June. Next year, it could be exporting power to the electric grid whenever needed once its application to fully connect is approved.",
      "The installation sits next to where Pacific Gas & Electric used to set up nine mobile generators every year from late spring through fall. Behind a chain-link fence stand six hydrogen fuel cells standing two stories tall made by Plug Power in New York. Water vapor wafted from one of the fuel cells being tested as The Associated Press got an exclusive tour of the site as it was in final testing.",
      "Shipping containers hold two pairs of Energy Vault's lithium-ion batteries. Nearby, a cinder block wall surrounds a massive, double-walled steel tank that holds 80,000 gallons (302,833 liters) of extremely cold liquid hydrogen that gets converted to gas to run the fuel cells.",
      "California utilities, especially PG&E, have had to pay large settlements over igniting wildfires. PG&E began cutting power at times to reduce fire risk in 2018, one of California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire years. It ships diesel generators to about a dozen towns to provide backup power during those periods.",
      "Calistoga, the largest with about 5,000 people, has had its power shut off 10 times. When generators ran, they spewed exhaust with harmful nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and soot. PG&E considered replacing Calistoga's diesel generators with a natural gas version that would pollute less, but opted instead for Energy Vault's fully clean solution, said Dave Canny, the utility\u2019s vice president for the North Coast Region.",
      "Energy Vault CEO Robert Piconi said other communities, military bases and data centers could all use something similar, but potential customers wanted to see it function first.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive proof point with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll have a lot of implications for how people think about alternative, sustainable solutions.\"",
      "The fuel cell maker, Plug Power, is planning for these types of products to be its main business in a decade. Energy Vault said it\u2019s buying clean hydrogen, produced with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, to run the fuel cells in Calistoga.",
      "\u201cThis solution is just beautiful,\" said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for green hydrogen projects to combat climate change. \"No noise, no emissions. And it\u2019s renewable. It\u2019s dumping diesel.\u201d",
      "Calistoga caters to tourists with a main thoroughfare that emphasizes local shops, restaurants, tasting rooms and art galleries over franchise stories. Residents pride themselves on a smalltown vibe, and say Calistoga isn't posh like much of the rest of Napa Valley.",
      "Some of those residents were concerned at first about the hydrogen, which is flammable and can be explosive. Fire Chief Jed Matcham said the \u201cvery, very large tank\u201d got his attention, too.",
      "He collaborated with Energy Vault on emergency planning and training, and said he's comfortable with the safety measures in place. Energy Vault's batteries also come with alarms, detectors and piping to extinguish a fire.",
      "The next time PG&E turns off the power to the area to prevent wildfires, it will tell Energy Vault when it\u2019s safe to electrify Calistoga. The batteries will get things back up and running, discharging the energy stored inside them to the local microgrid.",
      "Then the hydrogen fuel cells will take over to generate a steady level of power for a longer period. By working in tandem \u2014 the company likened it to the way a hybrid vehicle works \u2014 the batteries and fuel cells are expected to keep the lights on for about 48 hours or longer.",
      "Clive Richardson, who owns downtown's Calistoga Roastery and can typically be found behind the counter, drinking coffee and chatting with customers, said people in Calistoga get on edge when the winds kick up. And he knows what it's like to have to empty out his store when power goes out \u2014 a big hit for a small-business owner.",
      "A year-round clean solution for emergency power gives him a measure of comfort.",
      "\u201cThis will give us far more security than we had before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that it\u2019s come. Here we are, little ol\u2019 Calistoga, and we\u2019ve got the first-of-a-kind system that hopefully will be endorsed and go all over the world.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.",
      "The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.",
      "Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.",
      "While siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.",
      "\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.",
      "\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d",
      "In Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d",
      "Totenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"",
      "Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.",
      "\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d",

      "Space weather forecasters say northern lights may be visible in parts of the northern United States following weekend solar storms",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. Monday night following weekend solar storms.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday, though it wasn't as strong as last year's record. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",
      "Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",

      "It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "\"It's never helpful when he says those things. He's a believable person and he has a broad reach, but I think he's frustrated and people understand the context,\" Arrington said, predicting that both men will eventually resolve their dispute.",

      "Some DOGE staffers still embedded across federal agencies fear that the rift and public mudslinging between Trump and Musk could leave them vulnerable to political retribution and damage their future job prospects, multiple sources familiar with internal discussions told ABC News.",
      "Some fear their association with DOGE could make them targets if the feud escalates and Trump moves to investigate the government-slashing initiative that Musk led until he stepped away last week, the sources said.",
      "Others worry that if Trump distances himself from DOGE, their ties to it could become a professional liability, said sources.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, grew close to Trump over the last year as he campaigned for Trump's reelection before helping launch DOGE to try to fulfill Trump's goal of slashing the federal government. A quasi-governmental entity, DOGE has generated controversy as it's shuttered government agencies and gained access to sensitive data.",

      "\"This is a national security issue,\" Bannon said on his show Thursday. \"We're dealing with a very unstable individual out saying dangerous things about the president of the United States. He must be investigated ... and all government contracts should be suspended.\"",

      "Still, Musk's departure marked a major turning point for DOGE and how it will function day to day, given officials like Davis helped lead the DOGE team on a daily basis for months across the federal government.",
      "In Musk's absence, DOGE staff will continue to report to their respective agency leadership, sources said. Last week, the White House said that moving forward the \"DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's cabinet and the president himself.\"",
      "Sources tell ABC News that some DOGE staffers still working inside the federal government have begun looking for jobs elsewhere. And while there is concern among some about their future career prospects, some major tech companies have expressed interest in hiring DOGE alumni -- with companies like Coinbase even creating a dedicated hiring portal specifically recruiting former DOGE staff.",
      "White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields told ABC News in a statement, \"The mission of eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse is a part of the DNA of the federal government and will continue under the direction of the President, his cabinet, and agency heads to enhance government efficiency and prioritize responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Asked about any potential investigations into DOGE, a White House adviser said the president was only focused on passing his signature spending bill, known as the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Despite Trump and Musk's public feud, the president has yet to publicly criticize DOGE during the war of words, and has previously lauded the initiative.",
      "At a White House press availability in the Oval Office last week, Trump said Musk \"delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington\" and described DOGE as \"the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations\".",
      "Musk, for his part, downplayed the idea that DOGE needed him to survive as he left the Trump administration last week.",

      "He went on, \"We need to be able to follow their guidance, not just have them tell us, 'Follow your own science.' As the focus shifts from community to individuals, we're losing a lot of that underpinning, which has led to a lot of the gains in public health.\"",
      "Limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines",
      "Kennedy has repeatedly stated that he is not anti-vaccine and that he supports vaccination.",
      "Shortly after Trump's election, Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News that \"if vaccines are working for somebody, I'm not going to take them away. People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy said he supported the childhood vaccination schedule and that he would not do anything as head of HHS that \"makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines.\"",
      "Separately, in an opinion piece Kennedy wrote for Fox News in March on the nationwide measles outbreak, he said the measles vaccine helps protect individuals and provides \"community immunity\" but also called the decision to vaccinate a \"personal one.\"",
      "However, last week, Kennedy announced the removal of the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC's immunization schedule for \"healthy children and healthy pregnant women.\"",
      "The CDC's immunization schedule is not just a guide for doctors but also determines insurance coverage for most major private plans and Medicaid expansion programs. Following Kennedy's announcement, the schedule was updated noting all children would be eligible for COVID vaccines, but now under a shared-clinical decision-making model -- allowing parents to choose whether their children are vaccinated alongside advice from a doctor.",
      "\"Regarding the vaccines, HHS is restoring the doctor-patient relationship,\" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told ABC News in a statement. \"We are encouraging those groups to consult with their health care provider to help them make an informed decision. This is freedom of choice.\"",
      "\"If you restrict access, you necessarily restrict choice,\" Dr. Matthew Ferrari, a professor of biology and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University, told ABC News. \"Those two things are antithetical. You can't do both. You can't say you're allowing choice if you're restricting access.\"",
      "Ferrari said the idea of \"medical freedom\" is catchy, but public health recommendations are made based on how to protect the most vulnerable individuals.",

      "\"In terms of limiting people's choices, it is important to consider all the different roles that food plays in someone's life, and so obviously we want people eating nutritious foods, but also we need to acknowledge that food is a source of enjoyment,\" Petersen said. \"A lot of social situations revolve around food. So, when we're thinking about reducing people's access to given foods, we need to think about the consequences of that.\"",
      "One unintended consequence could be an eligible family not signing up for SNAP benefits because of the restrictions, she said.",
      "Even if a ban on buying candy and soda with SNAP benefits does occur, Petersen said she is not aware of any evidence that shows banning certain foods leads to healthier diets.",
      "She added that the nation's dietary guidelines are written to emphasize healthy foods like fruits and vegetable rather than telling people to avoid or restrict less healthy foods.",
      "\"All foods can be consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern. It's really just the amount and the frequency that determines whether that pattern is helpful overall or less helpful,\" Petersen said. \"People can have small indulgences, but really, we're interested in what is their pattern over a period of time.\"",
      "Providing incentives for purchasing healthier foods may be more effective and still allow people to have choice, Petersen said.",
      "A 2018 study used a model simulation to study the effects of food incentives, disincentives or restrictions in SNAP.",
      "One of the simulations involving incentives for foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish and plant-based oils found to have the most substantial health benefits and be the most cost-effective.",
      "\"Things like fruits and vegetables, they do tend to be more expensive, so if you incentivize them by providing more benefits \u2026 that's making the dollar go further, and it's kind of making the economic piece of this a bit stronger,\" Petersen said. \"A lot of this is framed around personal choice. Rather than restricting access to, how can we give people more access to healthy foods? I think that's going to have the greatest benefit here.\"",

    "summary": "Here's how the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to his home country of El Salvador despite a court order barring his deportation there, has progressed.",
    "story": [
      "The alleged MS-13 member was sent to a Salvadoran prison.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living Maryland, was mistakenly deported in March to a mega-prison in his home country of El Salvador -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which his family denies.",
      "After a series of court battles in which the Trump administration said it could not bring him back despite the Supreme Court ordering them to facilitate his return, Abrego Garcia was indicted for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the United States, and brought back to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Here is how the case has unfolded.",
      "The Trump administration, as part of its immigration crackdown, deports three planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador, where they are incarcerated in the notorious CECOT mega-prison under an agreement with the Salvadoran government. The alleged gang members include Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose protected legal status precludes him from being deported to that country.",
      "Families of several of the deported men tell ABC News that their detained relatives have no criminal record in the United States -- a fact that's acknowledged by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, who nonetheless says that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",
      "In a sworn declaration as part of a lawsuit brought by Abrego Garcia's attorneys, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official says Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador as a result of an \"administrative error\" -- but that he is still under a \"final order of removal\" for deportation, after the government rescinded his protected legal status due to his purported gang ties as alleged by a confidential police informant.",
      "Court documents say that on March 12, Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed\" due to the MS-13 allegations, after which he was transferred to a detention center in Texas and then deported to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, at a hearing in Maryland, grants a preliminary injunction and orders the government to \"facilitate and effectuate\" the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States by midnight on April 7.",
      "Asked by Judge Xinis under what authority law enforcement officers seized Abrego Garcia, DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni says he does not have the answer, telling the judge, \"Your honor, my answer to a lot of these questions is going to be frustrating and I'm also frustrated that I have no answers for you on a lot of these questions.\"",
      "A day after the hearing, the Justice Department places DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni on indefinite paid leave over a \"failure to zealously advocate\" for the government's interests.",
      "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issues a temporary administrative stay putting off Judge Xinis' midnight deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, in order to give the court more time to consider the arguments presented by both sides.",
      "After the Trump administration, in a court filing, argues that a judge can't demand Abrego Garcia's return because a federal court can't order a president to engage in foreign diplomacy, an attorney for Abrego Garcia tells ABC News he believes the Supreme Court will rule in his client's favor.",
      "In an interview with ABC News, Abrego Garcia's wife, a U.S. citizen, denies the Trump administration's allegation that her husband is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously rules that Judge Xinis \"properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"The intended scope of the term 'effectuate' in the District Court's order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court's authority,\" the court writes. \"The District Court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\"",
      "The Trump administration, interpreting the ruling as prohibiting the district court from ordering the executive branch to take any action that would violate the separation of powers, celebrates the order as a victory for the administration.",
      "Saying \"the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly\" that Abrego Garcia should be released from El Salvador, Judge Xinis slams the government's handling of the case and orders the Justice Department to provide her with \"daily updates\" on Abrego Garcia's status and their efforts to bring him back.",
      "A State Department official, in response to Judge Xinis' demand for daily updates, tells the judge that Abrego Garcia is \"alive and secure\" in El Salvador's CECOT prison, but provides no information about their efforts to return him to the United States.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, in an Oval Office meeting with President Trump and the visiting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, says that Abrego Garcia's return is \"up to El Salvador,\" after which Bukele says, \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Judge Xinis, in a hearing, takes Justice Department attorneys to task over the Trump administration's inaction and orders government officials to testify under oath through expedited discovery in order to resolve Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation.",
      "Prior to the hearing, a DHS official says the Trump administration is \"prepared to facilitate Abrego Garcia's presence in the United States ... if he presents at a port of entry\" -- but that DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract him \"from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "The Department of Justice files notice that it will appeal Judge Xinis' ruling ordering the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, and releases two documents that were previously used to allegedly tie Abrego Garcia to MS-13.",

      "\"In 2018, A.O.C. shocked the world and changed our politics for the better with her historic victory. On June 24, we will do the same,\" Mamdani told the Times in a statement.",
      "Mamdani, a state assemblymember and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has been steadily inching upward in the polls and fundraising. He is running on a progressive platform that includes a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments, eliminating fares for New York City buses and opening city-owned grocery stores. Mamdani envisions the latter two being funded by higher taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals; some have cautioned that he would need support from state government for those taxes.",
      "Her announcement came the day after a chaotic two-hour debate punctuated by candidates shouting over an increasingly exasperated slate of moderators.",
      "Nine Democrats who wish to be New York City's next mayor sparred over how they'd interact with President Donald Trump, public safety, affordability and other topics.",
      "Out of those who were onstage, Cuomo leads the pack in polling while Mamdani is slowly closing the gap in second place. The rest of the candidates have struggled to break through.",
      "Each candidate was asked how they would work with -- or charge against -- Trump if elected mayor. Cuomo vowed that he is an adversary that Trump could not best.",
      "\"He can be beaten. But he has to know that he's up against an adversary who can actually beat him. I am the last person on this stage that Mr. Trump wants to see as mayor, and that is why I should be the first choice for the people of the city to have as mayor,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Mamdani, answering the question, said, \"I am Donald Trump's worst nightmare, as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in, and the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in D.C. ... I have to pick up the phone for the more than 20,000 New Yorkers who contributed an average donation of about $80 to break fundraising records and put our campaign in second place.\"",
      "Cuomo did not directly respond to Mamdani's attack on the debate stage.",
      "Some billionaires who have previously supported Trump, such as prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and Home Depot founder Ken Langone, have donated to an independent group, the super PAC Fix the City, that supports Cuomo. Cuomo's campaign is not allowed to coordinate with the group. In response to reporting on Cuomo's wealthy supporters, Fix the City spokesperson Liz Benjamin told the New York Times that \"donors have supported Fix the City because they know that Andrew Cuomo has the right experience and the right plans for New York City.\"",
      "Multiple controversies surrounding Cuomo -- including accusations against him of sexual harassment, which he denies -- came up during the debate.",
      "Former state assemblymember Michael Blake, while answering a question on public safety, brought up the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo: \"The people who don't feel safe are young women, mothers and grandmothers around Andrew Cuomo, that's the greatest threat to public safety in New York City.\"",
      "Cuomo, later asked about the allegations -- and if he would do anything differently given investigations that alleged his leadership fostered a toxic work environment -- told the moderators, \"Let's just make sure we have the facts. A report was done four years ago making certain allegations. I said at the time that it was political and it was false.\"",
      "He added that five district attorneys found \"nothing\" and he was dropped from one case.",
      "\"I said at the time that if I offended anyone, it was unintentional, but I apologize, and I say that today.\"",

    "story": [
      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "Convicted killer and recaptured prison escapee Grant Hardin, known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks,\u201d has been transferred to the Varner SuperMax prison southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas prison authorities announced Saturday",
      "Convicted killer and recaptured prison escapee Grant Hardin, known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks,\u201d has been transferred to the Varner SuperMax prison southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas prison authorities announced Saturday.",
      "After a nearly two-week search in the rugged mountains of northern Arkansas, authorities recaptured Hardin on Friday 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) northwest of the prison from which he escaped. Hardin briefly attempted to run from officers when he saw them approach, but he was quickly tackled to the ground, said Rand Champion, a spokesperson for the Arkansas prison system.",
      "Authorities tried to track Hardin using drones, bloodhounds and a helicopter, but high water from heavy rains during the search raised the water level in creeks and streams around the prison. That likely limited his abilities \u2014 and also those of the searchers -- to move through the rugged terrain, Champion said.",
      "\u201cThe direction he went, specifically around Moccasin Creek, saw high water due to the abundance of rain the last few weeks, which more than likely limited his options to get around the area,\u201d Champion said. \u201cSearch teams had looked through this area before, but the high water previously limited their ability to fully investigate.\u201d",
      "Residents of the nearby town of Calico Rock, like Roger Simons, said they were surprised to learn that Hardin had stayed so close to the prison.",
      "\u201cNone of us really thought he was still in the area,\u201d said Simons, a local bartender. \u201cWe thought he was long gone \u2014 that's what I would have bet my money on.\"",
      "Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in a fatal shooting. He escaped by impersonating a corrections officer \u201cin dress and manner,\u201d according to a court document.",
      "A prison officer in one of the guard towers opened a secure gate, allowing him to walk out of the facility. Authorities say they are investigating why Hardin's identity was not checked before he was allowed to leave.",
      "Benton County Prosecutor Bryan Sexton, who oversaw Hardin\u2019s convictions for murder and rape, said he had been in close contact with law enforcement officials who were \u201cconsistent\u201d with their belief that Hardin remained in the northern Arkansas region.",
      "Hardin is a former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border whose notoriety led to a TV documentary called \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d Sexton said his escape had significantly disrupted the lives of trial witnesses and Hardin's victims, whom he kept updated on the pursuit for the fugitive.",
      "\u201cEvery one of them to a person informed me that they had to make changes in their lives because they had had concerns for their safety,\u201d Sexton said.",
      "After Hardin's recapture, \u201cthey could get closure in their lives and secondly go back to their normal lives, which had been disrupted the whole time he was out,\u201d Sexton said.",
      "Cheryl Tillman, the sister of a man shot by Hardin in 2017, told The Associated Press that Hardin\u2019s capture was a \u201cbig sigh of relief\u201d for her whole family.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have to walk around, turning around all the time, thinking somebody\u2019s on our back,\u201d Tillman said, emphasizing her appreciation for the officers who helped capture Hardin.",
      "Sexton said he was more assured now that Hardin was being sent to a more secure facility.",
      "The Varner Unit, established in 1987, has the capacity to house 1,714 inmates. It is the site where former President Bill Clinton\u2019s gubernatorial chief of staff, a death penalty opponent, faced charges for trying to smuggle a knife and tattoo needles into death row.",
      "Within Varner, a special \u201csupermax\u201d unit houses the most high-risk prisoners such as a man who fatally shot a soldier at a military recruiting station and death row inmates such as convicted child rapist and murderer Zachary Holly. Damien Wayne Echols of the West Memphis Three was also incarcerated there prior to his release.",
      "\u201cBy reputation, Varner is the most secure prison in the Arkansas system,\u201d Sexton said. \"I think that all things considering, putting him (Hardin) in the most secure facility we can is probably a wise thing to do.\"",

      "It\u2019s also symbolic of a shift back to the roots of the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball, to when it wasn\u2019t just used for Red Sox games but for other sports and political events.",
      "\u201cMost people\u2019s experience there is solely related to baseball,\u201d said Richard Johnson, Fenway expert and curator at The Sports Museum in Boston. \u201cBut the fact is that this year, you can see an event that\u2019ll be very similar to what your grandparents saw.\u201d",
      "Promoters Mark and Matt Nolan want \u201cFight Night at Fenway,\u201d scheduled for Saturday, to be both a time capsule and time machine, taking spectators back to boxing\u2019s glory days and what the sport can be for the city in the future.",
      "The Nolans got their license to organize fights last year with the goal of bringing boxing back to Boston. After Fenway, \u201cThat\u2019s mission accomplished,\u201d Matt Nolan said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just like our dream, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream \u2014 every boxer on planet Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the idea that some kid can fight his way to Fenway Park. It\u2019s like hitting the lottery. You can\u2019t you can\u2019t beat it. There\u2019s nothing comparable.\u201d",
      "Boston has played a long and impressive role in American boxing history and the development of the sport itself, said Johnson, author of \u201cField of Our Fathers, An Illustrated History of Fenway Park.\u201d",
      "The city was home to \u201cBoston\u2019s Strong Boy,\u201d John L. Sullivan, born in 1858 to Irish immigrant parents and widely considered America\u2019s first sports superstar. The first heavyweight champion of the world, he was as famous as Muhammad Ali was in his time.",
      "Sam Langford, a Black Canadian-born boxer, moved to Boston as a teenager but was blocked from competing in the world championships by racist policies and is considered one of the greatest non-champions in boxing.",
      "Other boxing stars with Boston connections include Marvin Hagler and Rocky Marciano of nearby Brockton. \u201dThe Boston Bomber\u201d Tony DeMarco, whose statue raises his fists at passersby in Boston\u2019s North End, was the last fighter to win in the ring at Fenway in 1956.",
      "For a time after it was built, Fenway Park was the only outdoor venue with a significant seating capacity in Boston, making it a destination for all kinds of events, including boxing starting in 1920.",
      "After new owners took over in 2002, the park became a venue for a variety of activities, including concerts and sporting events such as hockey, snowboarding, Irish football and curling.",
      "\u201cBack in the day, it was sort of the Swiss Army knife of sports facilities in Boston. And it\u2019s returned to that \u2014 a little bit of everything. So, returning boxing to the park is just a nod to the past,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other venues can feel \u201cmore corporate and sterile,\u201d but Fenway is living history, said Johnson, who calls it the \u201clargest open-air museum in New England.\u201d",
      "Mark Nolan said it\u2019s not for lack of trying that no one has hosted a boxing fight at Fenway in almost 70 years. But many promoters couldn\u2019t make a pitch that landed with ballpark management.",
      "The Nolans, who teach full time and own a boxing gym in Waltham where people can train regardless of their ability to pay, were different. After success hosting events at other venues, Mark Nolan said Fenway Sports Group connected to their \u201ceveryman\u201d appeal and decided to give them a shot.",
      "The brothers fell in love with boxing while accompanying their father, a boat captain, to the gym as kids.",
      "When they expanded from coaching amateur boxers to professionals five years ago, they were dismayed by what they found: shows full of uneven fights set up to make the promoters as much money as possible, with established amateurs fighting people who \u201chave no right putting gloves on in any capacity whatsoever\u201d in venues like high school gymnasiums. Fighters weren\u2019t being paid fairly and contracts weren\u2019t transparent.",
      "They came up with a simple business plan: pick good venues, pay fighters well and only host matches in Boston proper. They said a lot of promoters sell fighters, but they\u2019re focused on selling fights fans want to see.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re making sure that every fight is well-matched,\u201d said Thomas \u201cThe Kid\u201d O\u2019Toole, a fighter from rural Galway, Ireland, who has lived in Boston for the past two years, \u201cNobody wants to see someone go in and just knock their opponent out right away and beat them up for four, six, eight rounds. They want to see a competitive fight.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Toole went professional in 2021 and is undefeated with 13 fights. He said his fight against St. Louis-born Vaughn \u201cDa Animal\u201d Alexander at Fenway will be \u201cthe biggest test of his career.\u201d",

But at the same time, I\u2019m trying to use it just as a huge opportunity and really soak in the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cPressure makes diamonds.",

      "President Donald Trump grew impatient with how long it was taking to finish new planes to serve as Air Force One, so he started to look for other options",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump really wants to fly on an upgraded Air Force One \u2014 but making that happen could depend on whether he\u2019s willing to cut corners with security.",
      "As government lawyers sort out the legal arrangement for accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family, another crucial conversation is unfolding about modifying the plane so it's safe for the American president.",
      "Installing capabilities equivalent to the decades-old 747s now used as Air Force One would almost certainly consign the project to a similar fate as Boeing's replacement initiative, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns.",
      "Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told lawmakers Thursday that those security modifications would cost less than $400 million but provided no details.",
      "Satisfying Trump's desire to use the new plane before the end of his term could require leaving out some of those precautions, however.",
      "A White House official said Trump wants the Qatari jet ready as soon as possible while adhering to security standards. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not provide details on equipment issues or the timeline.",
      "Trump has survived two assassination attempts, and Iran allegedly also plotted to kill him, so he\u2019s well aware of the danger he faces. However, he seems willing to take some chances with security, particularly when it comes to communications. For example, he likes to keep his personal phone handy despite the threat of hacks.",
      "He boasted this week that the government got the jet \u201cfor free,\u201d saying, \u201cWe need it as Air Force One until the other ones are done.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what it would take to make the Qatari plane into a presidential transport:",
      "Air Force One is the call sign for any plane that's carrying the president. The first aircraft to get the designation was a propeller-powered C-54 Skymaster, which ferried Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in 1945. It featured a conference room with a bulletproof window.",
      "Things are a lot more complicated these days. Boeing has spent years stripping down and rebuilding two 747s to replace the versions that have carried presidents for more than three decades. The project is slated to cost more than $5.3 billion and may not be finished before Trump leaves office.",
      "A 2021 report made public through the Freedom of Information Act outlines the unclassified requirements for the replacement 747s under construction. At the top of the list \u2014 survivability and communications.",
      "The government decided more than a decade ago that the new planes had to have four engines so they could remain airborne if one or two fail, said Deborah Lee James, who was Air Force secretary at the time. That creates a challenge because 747s are no longer manufactured, which could make spare parts harder to come by.",
      "Air Force One also has to have the highest level of classified communications, anti-jamming capabilities and external protections against foreign surveillance, so the president can securely command military forces and nuclear weapons during a national emergency. It's an extremely sensitive and complex system, including video, voice and data transmissions.",
      "James said there are anti-missile measures and shielding against radiation or an electromagnetic pulse that could be caused by a nuclear blast.",
      "\u201cThe point is, it remains in flight no matter what,\u201d she said.",
      "If the Qatari plane is retrofitted to presidential standards, it could cost $1.5 billion and take years, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that aren't publicly available.",
      "Testifying before Congress this week, Meink discounted such estimates, arguing that some of the costs associated with retrofitting the Qatari plane would have been spent anyway as the Air Force moves to build the long-delayed new presidential planes, including buying aircraft for training and to have spares available if needed.",
      "In response, Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., said that based on the contract costs for the planes that the Air Force is building, it would cost about $1 billion to strip down the Qatar plane, install encrypted communications, harden its defenses and make other required upgrades.",
      "James said simply redoing the wiring means \u201cyou\u2019d have to break that whole thing wide open and almost start from scratch.\"",
      "Trump, as commander in chief, could waive some of these requirements. He could decide to skip shielding systems from an electromagnetic pulse, leaving his communications more vulnerable in case of a disaster but shaving time off the project.",
      "After all, Boeing has already scaled back its original plans for the new 747s. Their range was trimmed by 1,200 nautical miles, and the ability to refuel while airborne was scrapped.",
      "Paul Eckloff, a former leader of protection details at the Secret Service, expects the president would get the final say.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Service's job is to plan for and mitigate risk,\" he said. \"It can never eliminate it.\u201d",
      "If Trump does waive some requirements, James said that should be kept under wraps because \"you don\u2019t want to advertise to your potential adversaries what the vulnerabilities of this new aircraft might be.\u201d",
      "It's unlikely that Trump will want to skimp on the plane's appearance. He keeps a model of a new Air Force One in the Oval Office, complete with a darker color scheme that echoes his personal jet instead of the light blue design that's been used for decades.",
      "Trump toured the Qatari plane in February when it was parked at an airport near Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort. Air Force chief of staff Gen. David Allvin was there, too.",
      "The U.S. official said the jet needs maintenance but not more than what would be expected of a four-engine plane of its complexity.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it would be irresponsible to put the president and national security equipment aboard the Qatari plane \u201cwithout knowing that the aircraft is fully capable of withstanding a nuclear attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Boeing's project has been hampered by stress corrosion cracks on the planes and excessive noise in the cabins from the decompression system, among other issues that have delayed delivery, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.",
      "Boeing referred questions to the Air Force, which said in a statement that it's working with the aircraft manufacturer to find ways to accelerate the delivery of at least one of the 747s.",
      "Even so, the aircraft will have to be tested and flown in real-world conditions to ensure no other issues.",
      "James said it remains to be seen how Trump would handle any of those challenges.",
      "\u201cThe normal course of business would say there could be delays in certifications,\u201d she said. \u201cBut things seem to get waived these days when the president wants it.\u201d",

      "As World Pride wraps up this weekend in Washington D",
      "WASHINGTON -- David Perry recalls being young and gay in 1980s Washington D.C. and having \u201can absolute blast.\u201d He was fresh out of college, raised in Richmond, Virginia, and had long viewed the nation's capital as \u201cthe big city\u201d where he could finally embrace his true self.",
      "He came out of the closet here, got a job at the National Endowment for the Arts where his boss was a gay Republican, and \u201clost my virginity in D.C. on August 27, 1980,\u201d he says, chuckling.",
      "The bars and clubs were packed with gay men and women \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 and almost all of them deep in the closet.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of gay men in D.C., and they all seemed to work for the White House or members of Congress. It was kind of a joke. This was pre-Internet, pre-Facebook, pre-all of that. So people could be kind of on the down-low. You would run into congresspeople at the bar,\u201d Perry says. \u201cThe closet was pretty transparent. It\u2019s just that no one talked about it.\u201d",
      "He also remembers a billboard near the Dupont Circle Metro station with a counter ticking off the total number of of AIDS deaths in the District of Columbia.",
      "\u201cI remember when the number was three,\u201d says Perry, 63.",
      "Now Perry, a public relations professional in San Francisco, is part of a generation that can find itself overshadowed amidst the after-parties and DJ sets of World Pride, which wraps up this weekend with a two-day block party on Pennsylvania Avenue. Advocates warn of a quiet crisis among retirement-age LGBTQ+ people and a community at risk of becoming marginalized inside their own community.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really easy for Pride to be about young people and parties,\u201d says Sophie Fisher, LGBTQ program coordinator for Seabury Resources for Aging, a company that runs queer-friendly retirement homes and assisted-living facilities and which organized a pair of Silver Pride events last month for LGBTQ+ people over age 55.",
      "These were \u201cthe first people through the wall\u201d in the battle for gay rights and protections, Fisher says. Now, \u201cthey kind of get swept under the rug.\u201d",
      "The challenges and obstacles for elderly LGBTQ+ people can be daunting.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a society that really values youth as is. When you throw in LGBTQ on top of that, it\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d says Christina Da Costa of the group SAGE \u2014 Services and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Elders. \u201cWhen you combine so many factors, you have a population that\u2019s a lot less likely to thrive than their younger brethren.\u201d",
      "Older LGBTQ+ people are far more likely to have no contact with their family and less likely to have children to help care for them, Da Costa says. Gay men over 60 are the precise generation that saw their peer group decimated by AIDS. The result: chronic loneliness and isolation.",
      "\u201cAs you age, it becomes difficult to find your peer group because you don't go out to bars anymore,\u201d says Yvonne Smith, a 73-year-old D.C. resident who moved to Washington at age 14. \u201cThere are people isolated and alone out there.\u201d",
      "These seniors are also often poorer than their younger brethren. Many were kicked out of the house the moment they came out of the closet, and being openly queer or nonbinary could make you unemployable or vulnerable to firing deep into the 1990s.",
      "\u201cYou didn't want to be coming out of a gay bar, see one of your co-workers or one of your students,\u201d Smith says. \u201cPeople were afraid that if it was known you were gay, they would lose their security clearance or not be hired at all.\u201d",
      "In April, founders cut the ribbon on Mary's House, a new 15-unit living facility for LGBTQ+ seniors in southeast Washington. These kind of inclusive senior-care centers are becoming an increasing priority for LGBTQ+ elders.",
      "Rayceen Pendarvis, a D.C. queer icon, performer and presenter, says older community members who enter retirement homes or assisted-living centers can face social isolation or hostility from judgmental residents.",
      "\u201cAs we age, we lose our peers. We lose our loved ones and some of us no longer have the ability to maintain our homes,\u201d says Pendarvis, who identifies as \u201ctwo-spirit\u201d and eschews all pronouns. \u201cSometimes they go in, and they go back into the closet. It\u2019s very painful for some.\u201d",
      "Perry and others see a clear divide between their generation and the younger LGBTQ+ crowd. Younger people, Perry says, drink and smoke a lot less and do much less bar-hopping in the dating-app age.",
      "Others can't help but gripe a bit about how these youngsters don't know how good they have it.",
      "\u201cThey take all these protections for granted,\u201d Smith says.",
      "The younger generation \u201cgot comfortable,\u201d Pendarvis says, and sometimes doesn't fully understand the multigenerational fight that came before.",
      "\u201cWe had to fight to get the rights that we have today,\u201d Pendarvis said. \u201cWe fought for a place at the table. We CREATED the table!\u201d",
      "Now that fight is on again as President Donald Trump's administration sets the community on edge with an open culture war targeting trans protections and drag shows, and enforcing a binary view of gender identity.",
      "The struggle against that campaign may be complicated by a quiet reality inside the LGBTQ+ community: These issues remain a topic of controversy among some LGBTQ+ seniors.",
      "Perry said he has observed that some older lesbians remain leery of trans women; likewise, he said, some older gay men are leery of the drag-queen phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThere is a good deal of generational sensitivity that needs to be practiced by our older gay brethren,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gender fluidity that has come about in the last 15 years, I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t have to adjust my understanding of it sometimes.\u201d",
      "Despite the internal complexities, many are hoping to see a renewed sense of militancy and street politics in the younger LGBTQ+ generation. Sunday's rally and March for Freedom, starting at the Lincoln Memorial, is expected to be particularly defiant given the 2025 context.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a whole new era of activism,\u201d Perry says. \u201cI think we will find our spine and our walking shoes \u2013 maybe orthopedic \u2013 and protest again. But I really hope that the younger generation helps us pick up this torch.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has approved terms of a sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that will upend the way college sports have been run for more than a century",
      "A federal judge has approved terms of a sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust settlement that will upend the way college sports have been run for more than a century. In short, schools can now directly pay players through licensing deals \u2014 a concept that goes against the foundation of amateurism that college sports was built upon.",
      "Some questions and answers about this monumental change for college athletics:",
      "A: Grant House is a former Arizona State swimmer who sued the defendants (the NCAA and the five biggest athletic conferences in the nation). His lawsuit and two others were combined and over several years the dispute wound up with the settlement that ends a decades-old prohibition on schools cutting checks directly to athletes. Now, each school will be able to make payments to athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). For reference, there are nearly 200,000 athletes and 350 schools in Division I alone and 500,000 and 1,100 schools across the entire NCAA.",
      "A: In Year 1, each school can share up to about $20.5 million with their athletes, a number that represents 22% of their revenue from things like media rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne famously told Congress \u201cthose are resources and revenues that don\u2019t exist.\u201d Some of the money will come via ever-growing TV rights packages, especially for the College Football Playoff. But some schools are increasing costs to fans through \u201ctalent fees,\u201d concession price hikes and \u201cathletic fees\u201d added to tuition costs.",
      "A: Scholarships and \u201ccost of attendance\u201d have always been part of the deal for many Division I athletes and there is certainly value to that, especially if athletes get their degree. The NCAA says its member schools hand out nearly $4 billion in athletic scholarships every year. But athletes have long argued that it was hardly enough to compensate them for the millions in revenue they helped produce for the schools, which went to a lot of places, including multimillion-dollar coaches\u2019 salaries. They took those arguments to court and won.",
      "A: Yes, since 2021. Facing losses in court and a growing number of state laws targeting its amateurism policies, the NCAA cleared the way for athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, including so-called donor-backed collectives that support various schools. Under House, the school can pay that money directly to athletes and the collectives are still in the game.",
      "A: Probably not. But under terms of the settlement, third parties are still allowed to cut deals with the players. Some call it a workaround, but most simply view this as the new reality in college sports as schools battle to land top talent and then keep them on campus. Top quarterbacks are reportedly getting paid around $2 million a year, which would eat up about 10% of a typical school\u2019s NIL budget for all its athletes.",
      "A: The defendant conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and Pac-12) are creating an enforcement arm that is essentially taking over for the NCAA, which used to police recruiting violations and the like. Among this new entity\u2019s biggest functions is to analyze third-party deals worth $600 or more to make sure they are paying players an appropriate \u201cmarket value\u201d for the services being provided. The so-called College Sports Commission promises to be quicker and more efficient than the NCAA. Schools are being asked to sign a contract saying they will abide by the rules of this new structure, even if it means going against laws passed in their individual states.",
      "A: A key component of the settlement is the $2.7 billion in back pay going to athletes who competed between 2016-24 and were either fully or partially shut out from those payments under previous NCAA rules. That money will come from the NCAA and its conferences (but really from the schools, who will receive lower-than-normal payouts from things like March Madness).",
      "A: Since football and men\u2019s basketball are the primary revenue drivers at most schools, and that money helps fund all the other sports, it stands to reason that the football and basketball players will get most of the money. But that is one of the most difficult calculations for the schools to make. There could be Title IX equity concerns as well.",
      "A: The settlement calls for roster limits that will reduce the number of players on all teams while making all of those players \u2013 not just a portion \u2013 eligible for full scholarships. This figures to have an outsize impact on Olympic-sport athletes, whose scholarships cost as much as that of a football player but whose sports don\u2019t produce revenue. There are concerns that the pipeline of college talent for Team USA will take a hit.",
      "A: The new enforcement arm seems ripe for litigation. There are also the issues of collective bargaining and whether athletes should flat-out be considered employees, a notion the NCAA and schools are generally not interested in, despite Tennessee athletic director Danny White\u2019s suggestion that collective bargaining is a potential solution to a lot of headaches. NCAA President Charlie Baker has been pushing Congress for a limited antitrust exemption that would protect college sports from another series of lawsuits but so far nothing has emerged from Capitol Hill.",

    "story": [
      "Some Democratic-led states are doubling down on their resistance to President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s administration targets states and local governments for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities, lawmakers in some Democratic-led states are intensifying their resistance by strengthening state laws restricting such cooperation.",
      "In California alone, more than a dozen pro-immigrant bills passed either the Assembly or Senate this week, including one prohibiting schools from allowing federal immigration officials into nonpublic areas without a judicial warrant.",
      "Other state measures have sought to protect immigrants in housing, employment and police encounters, even as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests as part of his plan for mass deportations.",
      "In Connecticut, legislation pending before Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont would expand a law that already limits when law enforcement officers can cooperate with federal requests to detain immigrants. Among other things, it would let \u201cany aggrieved person\u201d sue municipalities for alleged violations of the state's Trust Act.",
      "Two days after lawmakers gave final approval to the measure, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security included Connecticut on a list of hundreds of \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws. The list later was removed from the department's website after criticism that it errantly included some local governments that support Trump's immigration policies.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has enlisted hundreds of state and local law enforcement agencies to help identify immigrants in the U.S. illegally and detain them for potential deportation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement now lists 640 such cooperative agreements, a nearly fivefold increase under Trump.",
      "Trump also has lifted longtime rules restricting immigration enforcement near schools, churches and hospitals, and ordered federal prosecutors to investigate state or local officials believed to be interfering with his crackdown on illegal immigration. The Department of Justice sued Colorado, Illinois and New York, as well as several cities in those states and New Jersey, alleging their policies violate the U.S. Constitution or federal immigration laws.",
      "Just three weeks after Colorado was sued, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a wide-ranging law expanding the state\u2019s protections for immigrants. Among other things, it bars jails from delaying the release of inmates for immigration enforcement and allows penalties of up to $50,000 for public schools, colleges, libraries, child care centers and health care facilities that collect information about people's immigration status, with some exceptions.",
      "Polis rejected the administration's description of Colorado as a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d asserting that law officers remain \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to working with federal authorities on criminal investigations.",
      "\u201cBut to be clear, state and local law enforcement cannot be commandeered to enforce federal civil immigration laws,\u201d Polis said in a bill-signing statement.",
      "Illinois also has continued to press pro-immigrant legislation. A bill recently given final approval says no child can be denied a free public education because of immigration status \u2014 something already guaranteed nationwide under a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision. Supporters say the state legislation provides a backstop in case court precedent is overturned.",
      "The bill also requires schools to develop policies on handling requests from federal immigration officials and allows lawsuits for alleged violations of the measure.",
      "Democratic-led states are pursuing a wide range of means to protect immigrants.",
      "A new Oregon law bars landlords from inquiring about the immigration status of tenants or applicants. New laws in Washington declare it unprofessional conduct for bail bond agents to enforce civil immigration warrants, prohibit employers from using immigration status to threaten workers and let employees use paid sick leave to attend immigration proceedings for themselves or family members.",
      "Vermont last month repealed a state law that let law enforcement agencies enter into immigration enforcement agreements with federal authorities during state or national emergencies. They now need special permission from the governor to do so.",
      "As passed by the House, Maryland legislation also would have barred local governments from reaching immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. That provision was removed in the Senate following pushback from some of the seven Maryland counties that currently have agreements.",
      "The final version, which took effect as law at the start of June, forbids public schools and libraries from granting federal immigration authorities access to nonpublic areas without a judicial warrant or \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d",
      "Maryland Del. Nicole Williams said residents' concerns about Trump's immigration policies prompted her to sponsor the legislation.",
      "\u201cWe believe that diversity is our strength, and our role as elected officials is to make sure that all of the residents within our community \u2014 regardless of their background \u2014 feel safe and comfortable,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Though legislation advancing in Democratic states may shield against Trump's policies, \u201cI would say it\u2019s more so to send a message to immigrant communities to let them know that they are welcome,\u201d said Juan Avilez, a policy associate at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "In California, a law that took effect in 2018 already requires public schools to adopt policies \u201climiting assistance with immigration enforcement to the fullest extent possible.\u201d Some schools have readily applied the law. When DHS officers attempted a welfare check on migrant children at two Los Angeles elementary schools in April, they were denied access by both principals.",
      "Legislation passed by the state Senate would reinforce such policies by specifically requiring a judicial warrant for public schools to let immigration authorities into nonpublic areas, allow students to be questioned or disclose information about students and their families.",
      "\u201cHaving ICE in our schools means that you\u2019ll have parents who will not want to send their kids to school at all,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener said in support of the bill.",
      "But some Republicans said the measure was \u201cinjecting partisan immigration policies\u201d into schools.",
      "\u201cWe have yet to see a case in California where we have scary people in masks entering schools and ripping children away,\u201d said state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil. \u201cLet\u2019s stop these fear tactics that do us an injustice.\u201d",

      "The thefts also involved taking several watches worth more than $100,000 from former Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman\u2019s home and a burglary at the home of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell, who is from Washington, although nothing was stolen in that instance, according to court documents. Prosecutors say there was also an attempted burglary at baseball Hall of Famer Edgar Martinez\u2019s home.",
      "\"All people deserve to feel safe in their homes, and our office will continue to hold people accountable for criminal behavior,\u201d King County Prosecuting Attorney Leesa Manion said in a statement.",
      "There have been a slew of burglaries at the homes of well-known professional athletes across the U.S. in recent months. The players have been targeted because of the high-end products believed to be in their homes and sometimes the thefts happen when they are away with their teams for road games.",
      "The FBI has warned sports leagues about crime organizations targeting professional athletes. The NFL and NBA have also issued security alerts after burglaries at the homes of such star athletes as Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce.",
      "In a memo obtained by The Associated Press in November, the NFL said the homes of professional athletes across multiple sports have become \u201cincreasingly targeted for burglaries by organized and skilled groups.\u201d",
      "Riley is being held in the King County Jail on $1 million bail. It was not immediately clear whether he has a lawyer. The King County Department of Public Defense did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press and a spokesperson from the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office did not know whether Riley had a lawyer.",
      "The charges were the result of a monthslong investigation in which the county's prosecuting attorney's office worked with six police jurisdictions.",
      "Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Gary Ernsdorff said in a statement that their work is not over.",
      "\u201cWe still want to go and identify everybody who was involved and see if there are additional people that we can have sufficient evidence to charge,\u201d he said.",
      "Riley is expected to enter his initial plea in court during his arraignment June 16.",
      "He has another pending case in King County Superior Court in which he is charged with attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle and unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree.",

      "NEW YORK -- The fourth week of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 sex trafficking trial featured testimony from the second of two ex-girlfriends who are crucial witnesses in the government\u2019s quest to prove sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges against the hip-hop mogul.",
      "Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has pleaded not guilty in the trial, which resumes Monday.",
      "Here are key moments from the past week:",
      "Fearing career ruin, Combs delivered $100,000 in cash to a security guard for a Los Angeles hotel in return for assurances that he was given the only security footage of Combs' 2016 attack on then-girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura, the security guard testified.",
      "Eddy Garcia, 33, recounted how the deal came to be, saying he first heard from a fast talking, stuttering and \u201cvery nervous\u201d Combs on a phone call seeking to obtain the video of him kicking and dragging Cassie from the hotel\u2019s elevator bank into a hallway because \u201cif this got out it could ruin him.\u201d",
      "Days later, Garcia said, he was the nervous one when he was greeted in an office building by a smiling Combs who called him \u201cEddy, my angel\u201d before Garcia turned over a USB drive containing the security footage. Combs then made him sign a nondisclosure agreement promising it was the only copy of the video and that Garcia would never speak of it, he said.",
      "Then, Combs, with a bodyguard at his side, fed stacks of cash from a brown bag into a rectangular money counter machine until it reached $100,000, Garcia said. He said he pocketed $30,000 and gave $50,000 to his boss and $20,000 to another hotel security guard. Garcia testified under immunity.",
      "A recording of the hotel attack on Cassie aired on CNN last year and security footage along with clips of the security tape recorded by a guard on his personal phone so he could show it to his wife have been shown repeatedly during the trial.",
      "Minutes after a prosecutor complained that Combs was seen \u201cnodding furiously\u201d as his lawyer cross examined a witness on Thursday, Judge Arun Subramanian took a look himself and said he saw Combs \u201cnodding vigorously and looking at the jury\u201d and doing the same later when the lawyers and the judge were having a sidebar discussion.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said prosecutors were concerned because the gestures amounted to \u201ctestifying by nodding affirmatively\u201d while his lawyer asked questions.",
      "During a lunch break, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo promised to speak with Combs and ensure it wouldn't happen again after the judge told him it was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "The judge sternly responded: \u201cIf it happens again, if it happens even once, I will hear an application from the government to give a curative instruction to the jury, which you do not want. Or I will consider taking further measures, which could result in the exclusion of your client from the courtroom.\u201d",
      "A former Combs personal assistant who testified under the pseudonym \u201cMia\u201d told jurors that Combs had sexually assaulted her multiple times over her eight-year career, though the attacks were \u201crandom, sporadic, so oddly spaced out\u201d so that she thought each was the last.",
      "She said he first molested her and forcibly kissed her at his 40th birthday party before raping her months later in a guest room at his Los Angeles home.",
      "On cross examination, defense lawyer Brian Steel\u2019s suggested that she fabricated her claims to cash in on \u201cthe #MeToo money grab against Sean Combs.\u201d",
      "Steel confronted her with loving texts she sent Combs long after her employment ended and asked how she could tell him, as she did in a 2019 text, that she had imagined Combs rescuing her from a nightmare in which she was trapped in an elevator with R. Kelly, the singer who has since been convicted of sex trafficking.",
      "\"I was still brainwashed,\u201d Mia explained.",
      "The defense had one of its most successful moments of the trial when attorney Nicole Westmoreland cast doubt on the credibility of a graphic designer who says Combs once dangled her from the balcony of a 17th-floor apartment in Los Angeles.",
      "Bryana \u201cBana\u201d Bongolan, a friend of Cassie who is suing Combs, had taken a cellphone image of a softball-size welt on her leg that she said occurred when Combs held her over the balcony for 10 to 15 seconds and then threw her into furniture.",
      "After it was shown to the jury, Westmoreland showed the jury cellphone metadata revealing that the photograph was taken while Combs was on tour in September 2016, staying at a Manhattan hotel.",
      "\u201cYou agree that one person can\u2019t be in two places at the same time?\u201d Westmoreland asked.",
      "\u201cIn, like, theory, yeah,\u201d Bongolan responded.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d Westmoreland asked.",
      "\u201cHard to answer that one,\u201d she said.",
      "Later, Bongolan said she did not recall the exact date, but she had no doubt the balcony episode happened.",
      "A woman testifying under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d fought through tears and sobs to recount frequent sexual performances she participated in with male sex workers to please Combs and keep their three-year relationship alive until his September arrest.",
      "Jane's testimony, which is likely to continue deep into next week, is identical in many ways to the four-day testimony in the trial's first week by Cassie. Jane said she never wanted to have sex with other men but did it to please Combs because she loved him.",
      "Cassie described having hundreds of drug-fueled sexual performances known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d in which she had sex with male sex workers for days at a time while Combs watched, sometimes directed the activity, and pleasured himself.",
      "Jane described having nearly the same experiences from 2021 until last August, though she called them \u201chotel nights.\u201d She said her relationship with Combs began with romance but later became reliant upon the sexual performances, especially after Combs began paying rent for her apartment.",
      "Defense attorneys have insisted that Jane and Combs only engaged in consensual sex and that Jane's protests to Combs in text messages were fueled by jealousy.",

      "Residents will gather Saturday in a scenic Minneapolis neighborhood for an annual ritual \u2014 the sharpening of a gigantic No. 2 pencil",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Residents will gather Saturday in a scenic Minneapolis neighborhood for an annual ritual \u2014 the sharpening of a gigantic No. 2 pencil.",
      "The 20-foot-tall (6-meter-tall) pencil was sculpted out of a mammoth oak tree at the home of John and Amy Higgins. The beloved tree was damaged in a storm a few years ago when fierce winds twisted the crown off. Neighbors mourned. A couple even wept. But the Higginses saw it not so much as a loss, but as a chance to give the tree new life.",
      "The sharpening ceremony on their front lawn has evolved into a community spectacle that draws hundreds of people to the leafy neighborhood on Lake of the Isles, complete with music and pageantry. Some people dress as pencils or erasers. Two Swiss alphorn players will provide part of this year's entertainment. The hosts will commemorate a Minneapolis icon, the late music superstar Prince, by handing out purple pencils on what would have been his 67th birthday.",
      "In the wake of the storm, the Higginses knew they wanted to create a sculpture out of their tree. They envisioned a whimsical piece of pop art that people could recognize, but not a stereotypical chainsaw-carved, north-woods bear. Given the shape and circumference of the log, they came up with the idea of an oversized pencil standing tall in their yard.",
      "\u201cWhy a pencil? Everybody uses a pencil,\u201d Amy Higgins said. \u201cEverybody knows a pencil. You see it in school, you see it in people\u2019s work, or drawings, everything. So, it\u2019s just so accessible to everybody, I think, and can easily mean something, and everyone can make what they want of it.\u201d",
      "So they enlisted wood sculptor Curtis Ingvoldstad to transform it into a replica of a classic Trusty brand No. 2 pencil.",
      "\u201cPeople interpret this however they want to. They should. They should come to this and find whatever they want out of it,\u201d Ingvoldstad said. That's true even if their reaction is negative, he added. \u201cWhatever you want to bring, you know, it\u2019s you at the end of the day. And it\u2019s a good place. It\u2019s good to have pieces that do that for people.\"",
      "John Higgins said they wanted the celebration to pull the community together.",
      "\u201cWe tell a story about the dull tip, and we\u2019re gonna get sharp,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a renewal. We can write a new love letter, a thank you note. We can write a math problem, a to-do list. And that chance for renewal, that promise, people really seem to buy into and understand.\u201d",
      "To keep the point pointy, they haul a giant, custom-made pencil sharpener up the scaffolding that's erected for the event.",
      "Like a real pencil, this one is ephemeral. Every year they sharpen it, it gets a bit shorter. They've taken anywhere from 3 to 10 inches (8 to 25 centimeters) off a year. They haven't decided how much to shave off this year. They're OK knowing that they could reduce it to a stub one day. The artist said they'll let time and life dictate its form \u2014 that's part of the magic.",
      "\u201cLike any ritual, you've got to sacrifice something,\" Ingvoldstad said. \"So we\u2019re sacrificing part of the monumentality of the pencil, so that we can give that to the audience that comes, and say, \u2018This is our offering to you, and in goodwill to all the things that you\u2019ve done this year.\u2019\u201d",

      "Boxing is returning to Boston's Fenway Park for the first time in nearly 70 years",
      "BOSTON -- For the first time in nearly 70 years, boxing is returning to Boston's famed Fenway Park.",
      "The 11-fight card is the culmination of years of effort by twin brothers and longtime public schoolteachers who grew up in Watertown and want to revitalize boxing in the city that was home to some of the greatest athletes in the sport's history.",
      "It's also symbolic of a shift back to the roots of the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball, to when it wasn't just used for Red Sox games but for other sports and political events.",
      "\u201cMost people\u2019s experience there is solely related to baseball,\u201d said Richard Johnson, Fenway expert and curator at The Sports Museum in Boston. \"But the fact is that this year, you can see an event that'll be very similar to what your grandparents saw.\u201d",
      "Promoters Mark and Matt Nolan want \u201cFight Night at Fenway,\u201d scheduled for Saturday, to be both a time capsule and time machine, taking spectators back to boxing's glory days and what the sport can be for the city in the future.",
      "The Nolans got their license to organize fights last year with the goal of bringing boxing back to Boston. After Fenway, \u201cThat\u2019s mission accomplished,\" Matt Nolan said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just like our dream, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream \u2014 every boxer on planet Earth,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the idea that some kid can fight his way to Fenway Park. It\u2019s like hitting the lottery. You can\u2019t you can\u2019t beat it. There\u2019s nothing comparable.\"",
      "Boston has played a long and impressive role in American boxing history and the development of the sport itself, said Johnson, author of \u201cField of Our Fathers, An Illustrated History of Fenway Park.\"",
      "The city was home to \u201cBoston's Strong Boy,\u201d John L. Sullivan, born in 1858 to Irish immigrant parents and widely considered America\u2019s first sports superstar. The first heavyweight champion of the world, he was as famous as Muhammad Ali was in his time.",
      "Sam Langford, a Black Canadian-born boxer, moved to Boston as a teenager but was blocked from competing in the world championships by racist policies and is considered one of the greatest non-champions in boxing.",
      "Other boxing stars with Boston connections include Marvin Hagler and Rocky Marciano of nearby Brockton. \u201dThe Boston Bomber\u201d Tony DeMarco, whose statue raises his fists at passersby in Boston\u2019s North End, was the last fighter to win in the ring at Fenway in 1956.",
      "For a time after it was built, Fenway Park was the only outdoor venue with a significant seating capacity in Boston, making it a destination for all kinds of events, including boxing starting in 1920.",
      "After new owners took over in 2002, the park became a venue for a variety of activities, including concerts and sporting events such as hockey, snowboarding, Irish football and curling.",
      "\u201cBack in the day, it was sort of the Swiss Army knife of sports facilities in Boston. And it\u2019s returned to that \u2014 a little bit of everything. So, returning boxing to the park is just a nod to the past,\" Johnson said.",
      "Other venues can feel \u201cmore corporate and sterile,\" but Fenway is living history, said Johnson, who calls it the \u201clargest open-air museum in New England.\u201d",
      "Mark Nolan said it's not for lack of trying that no one has hosted a boxing fight at Fenway in almost 70 years. But many promoters couldn't make a pitch that landed with ballpark management.",
      "The Nolans, who teach full time and own a boxing gym in Waltham where people can train regardless of their ability to pay, were different. After success hosting events at other venues, Mark Nolan said Fenway Sports Group connected to their \u201ceveryman\u201d appeal and decided to give them a shot.",
      "The brothers fell in love with boxing while accompanying their father, a boat captain, to the gym as kids.",
      "When they expanded from coaching amateur boxers to professionals five years ago, they were dismayed by what they found: shows full of uneven fights set up to make the promoters as much money as possible, with established amateurs fighting people who \u201chave no right putting gloves on in any capacity whatsoever\u201d in venues like high school gymnasiums. Fighters weren't being paid fairly and contracts weren't transparent.",
      "They came up with a simple business plan: pick good venues, pay fighters well and only host matches in Boston proper. They said a lot of promoters sell fighters, but they're focused on selling fights fans want to see.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re making sure that every fight is well-matched,\" said Thomas \"The Kid\" O'Toole, a fighter from rural Galway, Ireland, who has lived in Boston for the past two years, \u201cNobody wants to see someone go in and just knock their opponent out right away and beat them up for four, six, eight rounds. They want to see a competitive fight.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Toole went professional in 2021 and is undefeated with 13 fights. He said his fight against St. Louis-born Vaughn \u201cDa Animal\u201d Alexander at Fenway will be \"the biggest test of his career.\"",
      "Massachusetts-born Lexi \u201cLil Savage\" Bolduc will compete in her fourth professional fight. She faces Sarah Couillard in a rematch after coming out on the losing end of a majority draw at the Royale.",
      "\u201cFighting at Fenway, I think adds a little bit of pressure because I\u2019m local, I grew up in Mass and idolized a lot of players as I was growing up. ... But at the same time, I'm trying to use it just as a huge opportunity and really soak in the moment,\" she said. \"Pressure makes diamonds.",

      "Call it the 911 presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Call it the 911 presidency.",
      "Despite insisting that the United States is rebounding from calamity under his watch, President Donald Trump is harnessing emergency powers unlike any of his predecessors.",
      "Whether it\u2019s leveling punishing tariffs, deploying troops to the border or sidelining environmental regulations, Trump has relied on rules and laws intended only for use in extraordinary circumstances like war and invasion.",
      "An analysis by The Associated Press shows that 30 of Trump\u2019s 150 executive orders have cited some kind of emergency power or authority, a rate that far outpaces his recent predecessors.",
      "The result is a redefinition of how presidents can wield power. Instead of responding to an unforeseen crisis, Trump is using emergency powers to supplant Congress\u2019 authority and advance his agenda.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s notable about Trump is the enormous scale and extent, which is greater than under any modern president,\u201d said Ilya Somin, who is representing five U.S. businesses who sued the administration, claiming they were harmed by Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.",
      "Because Congress has the power to set trade policy under the Constitution, the businesses convinced a federal trade court that Trump overstepped his authority by claiming an economic emergency to impose the tariffs. An appeals court has paused that ruling while the judges review it.",
      "The legal battle is a reminder of the potential risks of Trump\u2019s strategy. Judges traditionally have given presidents wide latitude to exercise emergency powers that were created by Congress. However, there\u2019s growing concern that Trump is pressing the limits when the U.S. is not facing the kinds of threats such actions are meant to address.",
      "\u201cThe temptation is clear,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program and an expert in emergency powers. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is how little abuse there was before, but we\u2019re in a different era now.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who has drafted legislation that would allow Congress to reassert tariff authority, said he believed the courts would ultimately rule against Trump in his efforts to single-handedly shape trade policy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Constitution. James Madison wrote it that way, and it was very explicit,\u201d Bacon said of Congress\u2019 power over trade. \u201cAnd I get the emergency powers, but I think it\u2019s being abused. When you\u2019re trying to do tariff policy for 80 countries, that\u2019s policy, not emergency action.\u201d",
      "The White House pushed back on such concerns, saying Trump is justified in aggressively using his authority.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is rightfully enlisting his emergency powers to quickly rectify four years of failure and fix the many catastrophes he inherited from Joe Biden \u2014 wide open borders, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, radical climate regulations, historic inflation, and economic and national security threats posed by trade deficits,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Of all the emergency powers, Trump has most frequently cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to justify slapping tariffs on imports.",
      "The law, enacted in 1977, was intended to limit some of the expansive authority that had been granted to the presidency decades earlier. It is only supposed to be used when the country faces \u201can unusual and extraordinary threat\u201d from abroad \u201cto the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.\u201d",
      "In analyzing executive orders issued since 2001, the AP found that Trump has invoked the law 21 times in presidential orders and memoranda. President George W. Bush, grappling with the aftermath of the most devastating terror attack on U.S. soil, invoked the law just 14 times in his first term. Likewise, Barack Obama invoked the act only 21 times during his first term, when the U.S. economy faced the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "The Trump administration has also deployed an 18th century law, the Alien Enemies Act, to justify deporting Venezuelan migrants to other countries, including El Salvador. Trump's decision to invoke the law relies on allegations that the Venezuelan government coordinates with the Tren de Aragua gang, but intelligence officials did not reach that conclusion.",
      "Congress has granted emergency powers to the presidency over the years, acknowledging that the executive branch can act more swiftly than lawmakers if there is a crisis. There are 150 legal powers \u2014 including waiving a wide variety of actions that Congress has broadly prohibited \u2014 that can only be accessed after declaring an emergency. In an emergency, for example, an administration can suspend environmental regulations, approve new drugs or therapeutics, take over the transportation system, or even override bans on testing biological or chemical weapons on human subjects, according to a list compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Democrats and Republicans have pushed the boundaries over the years. For example, in an attempt to cancel federal student loan debt, Joe Biden used a post-Sept. 11 law that empowered education secretaries to reduce or eliminate such obligations during a national emergency. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually rejected his effort, forcing Biden to find different avenues to chip away at his goals.",
      "Before that, Bush pursued warrantless domestic wiretapping and Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the detention of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast in camps for the duration of World War II.",
      "Trump, in his first term, sparked a major fight with Capitol Hill when he issued a national emergency to compel construction of a border wall. Though Congress voted to nullify his emergency declaration, lawmakers could not muster up enough Republican support to overcome Trump\u2019s eventual veto.",
      "\u201cPresidents are using these emergency powers not to respond quickly to unanticipated challenges,\u201d said John Yoo, who as a Justice Department official under George W. Bush helped expand the use of presidential authorities. \u201cPresidents are using it to step into a political gap because Congress chooses not to act.\u201d",
      "Trump, Yoo said, \u201chas just elevated it to another level.\u201d",
      "Conservative legal allies of the president also said Trump\u2019s actions are justified, and Vice President JD Vance predicted the administration would prevail in the court fight over tariff policy.",
      "\u201cWe believe \u2014 and we\u2019re right \u2014 that we are in an emergency,\u201d Vance said last week in an interview with Newsmax.",

      "Vance continued, \u201cThese governments are threatening to cut us off from that stuff, that is by definition, a national emergency.\u201d",
      "Republican and Democratic lawmakers have tried to rein in a president\u2019s emergency powers. Two years ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced legislation that would have ended a presidentially-declared emergency after 30 days unless Congress votes to keep it in place. It failed to advance.",
      "Similar legislation hasn\u2019t been introduced since Trump\u2019s return to office. Right now, it effectively works in the reverse, with Congress required to vote to end an emergency.",
      "\u201cHe has proved to be so lawless and reckless in so many ways. Congress has a responsibility to make sure there\u2019s oversight and safeguards,\u201d said Sen.

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- A convicted killer in Utah who developed dementia while on death row for 37 years is competent enough to be executed, a state judge ruled late Friday.",
      "Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, was sentenced to die in 1988 for killing Utah mother of three Maurine Hunsaker. Despite his recent cognitive decline, Menzies \u201cconsistently and rationally understands\" what is happening and why he is facing execution, Judge Matthew Bates wrote in a court order.",
      "\u201cMenzies has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his understanding of his specific crime and punishment has fluctuated or declined in a way that offends the Eighth Amendment,\u201d which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments, Bates said.",
      "Menzies had previously selected a firing squad as his method of execution. He would become only the sixth U.S. prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977.",
      "The Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office is expected to file a death warrant soon.",
      "Menzies\u2019 lawyers, who had argued his dementia was so severe that he could not understand why he was being put to death, said they plan to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cRalph Menzies is a severely brain-damaged, wheelchair-bound, 67-year-old man with dementia and significant memory problems,\u201d his attorney, Lindsey Layer, said in a statement. \u201cIt is deeply troubling that Utah plans to remove Mr. Menzies from his wheelchair and oxygen tank to strap him into an execution chair and shoot him to death.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has spared others prisoners with dementia from execution, including an Alabama man in 2019 who had killed a police officer.",
      "Over nearly four decades, attorneys for Menzies filed multiple appeals that delayed his death sentence, which had been scheduled at least twice before it was pushed back.",
      "Hunsaker, a 26-year-old married mother of three, was abducted by Menzies from the convenience store where she worked. She was later found strangled and her throat cut at a picnic area in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah. Menzies had Hunsaker\u2019s wallet and several other belongings when he was jailed on unrelated matters. He was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes.",
      "Matt Hunsaker, who was 10 years old when his mother was killed, said Friday that the family was overwhelmed with emotion to know that justice would finally be served.",

      "A federal judge has signed off on arguably the biggest change in the history of college sports, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes millions of dollars as soon as next month",
      "A federal judge signed off on arguably the biggest change in the history of college sports Friday, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes millions as soon as next month as the multibillion-dollar industry shreds the last vestiges of the amateur model that defined it for more than a century.",
      "Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports.",
      "The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years.",
      "One of the lead plaintiff attorneys, Steve Berman, called Friday's news \u201ca fantastic win for hundreds of thousands of college athletes.\u201d",
      "The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming.",
      "The scope of the changes \u2014 some have already begun \u2014 is difficult to overstate. The professionalization of college athletics will be seen in the high-stakes and expensive recruitment of stars on their way to the NFL and NBA, and they will be felt by athletes whose schools have decided to pare their programs. The agreement will resonate in nearly every one of the NCAA\u2019s 1,100 member schools boasting nearly 500,000 athletes.",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker said the deal \"opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports.\u201d",
      "Wilken\u2019s ruling comes 11 years after she dealt the first significant blow to the NCAA ideal of amateurism. Then, she ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon and others seeking a way to earn money from the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL) \u2014 a term that is now as common in college sports as \u201cMarch Madness\u201d or \u201cRoll Tide.\u201d",
      "It was just four years ago that the NCAA cleared the way for NIL money to start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger.",
      "Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte.",
      "The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC hold most of the power and decision-making heft, especially when it comes to the College Football Playoff, which is the most significant financial driver in the industry and is not under the NCAA umbrella like the March Madness tournaments are.",
      "The deal looked ready to go, but Wilken put a halt to it this spring after listening to a number of players who had lost their spots because of newly imposed roster limits being placed on teams.",
      "The limits were part of a trade-off that allowed the schools to offer scholarships to everyone on the roster, instead of only a fraction, as has been the case for decades. Schools started cutting walk-ons in anticipation of the deal being approved.",
      "Wilken asked for a solution and, after weeks, the parties decided to let anyone cut from a roster \u2014 now termed a \u201cDesignated Student-Athlete\u201d \u2014 return to their old school or play for a new one without counting against the new limit.",
      "Wilken ultimately agreed, going point-by-point through the objectors' arguments to explain why they didn't hold up. The main point pushed by the parties was that those roster spots were never guaranteed in the first place.",
      "\u201cThe modifications provide Designated Student-Athletes with what they had prior to the roster limits provisions being implemented, which was the opportunity to be on a roster at the discretion of a Division I school,\u201d Wilken wrote.",
      "Her decision, however, took nearly a month to write, leaving the schools and conferences in limbo \u2014 unsure if the plans they'd been making for months, really years, would go into play.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen how this will impact the future of inter-collegiate athletics \u2014 but as we continue to evolve, Carolina remains committed to providing outstanding experiences and broad-based programming to student-athletes,\u201d North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham said.",
      "The list of winners and losers is long and, in some cases, hard to tease out.",
      "A rough guide of winners would include football and basketball stars at the biggest schools, which will devote much of their bankroll to signing and retaining them. For instance, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood\u2019s NIL deal is reportedly worth between $10.5 million and $12 million.",
      "Losers, despite Wilken's ruling, figure to be at least some of the walk-ons and partial scholarship athletes whose spots are gone.",
      "Also in limbo are the Olympic sports many of those athletes play and that serve as the main pipeline for a U.S. team that has won the most medals at every Olympics since the downfall of the Soviet Union.",
      "All this is a price worth paying, according to the attorneys who crafted the settlement and argue they delivered exactly what they were asked for: an attempt to put more money in the pockets of the players whose sweat and toil keep people watching from the start of football season through March Madness and the College World Series in June.",
      "What the settlement does not solve is the threat of further litigation.",
      "Though this deal brings some uniformity to the rules, states still have separate laws regarding how NIL can be doled out, which could lead to legal challenges. Baker has been consistent in pushing for federal legislation that would put college sports under one rulebook and, if he has his way, provide some form of antitrust protection to prevent the new model from being disrupted again.",

      "SEATTLE -- Authorities have closed a wide swath of popular campgrounds and backpacking areas along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington as they search for a former Army soldier wanted in the deaths of his three young daughters.",
      "Dozens of additional law enforcement officers from an array of agencies joined the investigation and search Friday for Travis Caleb Decker, 32, four days after the girls \u2014 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker \u2014 were found dead at a remote campsite outside Leavenworth.",
      "The girls\u2019 mother reported them missing the night of May 30 when Decker failed to return them to her home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, after a scheduled visit.",
      "The Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that there were more than 100 officers involved in the search, which covered rugged terrain in the Cascade Mountains of central Washington, and more than 500 tips had poured in from the public.",
      "\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we have been given notice to, and are working in conjunction with our surrounding counties in the event Mr. Decker moves through the forest into their jurisdiction,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014, according to Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro. From 2014 to 2016, he was an automatic rifleman with the 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.",
      "Last September his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with the girls until he found housing.",
      "\u201cHe has made huge sacrifices to serve our country and loves his girls very much but he has got to get better,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not want to keep Travis from the girls at all. ... But I cannot have our girls staying in what is essentially a homeless shelter, at times unsupervised, with dozens of strange men, or staying in a tent or living in his truck with him both in extreme temperatures and unknown areas for their safety.\u201d",
      "Authorities warned people to be on the lookout for Decker and asked those with remote homes, cabins or outbuildings to keep them locked, to leave blinds open so law enforcement can see inside and to leave exterior lights on.",
      "It was unclear if Decker was armed, but the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said he should be considered dangerous. A reward of up to $20,000 was offered for information leading to his arrest.",
      "An online fundraiser for Whitney Decker raised more than $1 million, and friends Amy Edwards, who taught the girls in a theater program called \u201cShort Shakespeareans,\u201d and Mark Belton thanked supporters during a news conference Thursday.",
      "\u201cTheir laughter, curiosity and spirit left a mark on all of us,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThey were the kind of children that everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing and held close in their hearts.\u201d",
      "Edwards and Belton said Whitney Decker hopes the tragedy prompts changes to the state's Amber Alert system as well as improvements in mental health care for veterans. The night the girls were reported missing, Wenatchee police asked the Washington State Patrol to issue an Amber Alert but it declined, saying that as a custody matter without an imminent threat, the case did not meet the criteria for one.",
      "The patrol did issue an \u201cendangered missing person alert\u201d the next day, but those do not result in notifications being sent to mobile phones.",
      "As searches expanded for the girls last weekend, a sheriff's deputy found Decker's pickup in the area of Rock Island Campground, northwest of Leavenworth. There were two bloody handprints on the tailgate. The girls' bodies were discovered down an embankment nearby with evidence that they had been bound with zip ties, according to an affidavit filed in support of murder and kidnapping charges against Decker.",
      "County Coroner Wayne Harris said Friday that his office was awaiting pathology results to determine when and how the girls were killed.",
      "Authorities issued closure notices the previous day for that camping area, which lies in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, as well as for a large swath of rugged territory to the north. That included trails and campgrounds along the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from the Canadian border to Mexico, and around Stehekin, at the northern end of Lake Chelan.",

      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon had previously agreed to temporarily block the Republican administration, saying that plaintiffs were likely to show that Trump doesn't have the legal authority to unilaterally shutter the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which was created by Congress.",
      "But in Friday's ruling, Leon wrote that as much as the \u201cCourt laments the Executive Branch\u2019s efforts to cut off this lifeline for libraries and museums,\u201d recent court decisions suggested that the case should be heard in a separate court dedicated to contractual claims.",

      "Jurors in Hennepin County District Court deliberated two days before reaching their verdict in the case of Derrick John Thompson, 29, of Brooklyn Park, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported. In November, a federal court jury convicted Thompson on drug and firearms charges because investigators found a handgun, ammunition and illegal drugs in his vehicle after the June 2023 crash, and he is awaiting sentencing in that case.",
      "He was convicted Friday of 15 charges and his sentencing is set for July 24. Third-degree murder is unintentionally causing a death through \u201ceminently dangerous\u201d actions and with \u201ca depraved mind, without regard for human life.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis choices that day scarred many lives and affected an entire community,\u201d Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty told reporters following the verdict, according to KARE-TV.",
      "The Minneapolis crash victims \u2014 Salma Abdikadir, Siham Adam, Sabiriin Ali, Sahra Gesaade and Sagal Hersi \u2014 were between 17 and 20 years old, on their way home from preparations for a friend\u2019s wedding. Their deaths sparked sorrow and outage among Minnesota\u2019s sizeable Somali American population.",
      "Prosecutors have said Thompson was driving a black Cadillac Escalade on a Minnesota freeway at 95 mph (153 kph) in a 55 mph- (89 kph-) speed zone and abruptly cut across four lanes of traffic to exit the freeway, flying by a state highway patrol trooper.",
      "Thompson\u2019s defense attorney, Tyler Bliss, raised questions about whether Thompson\u2019s brother might have played a role in the crash that authorities did not investigate. The brother was not charged and testified that he didn\u2019t drive the SUV the night of the crash and Thompson was the last person he saw behind the wheel.",

Todd Lyons, the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, defended his tactics earlier this week against criticism that authorities are being too heavy-handed.

      "WASHINGTON -- A retired police officer was sentenced on Friday to serve 18 months behind bars for lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the Proud Boys extremist group's former top leader, who was under investigation for burning a Black Lives Matter banner in the nation's capital.",
      "Shane Lamond was a lieutenant for the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., when he fed information about its banner burning investigation to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio.",
      "Last December, after a trial without a jury, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., convicted Lamond of one count of obstructing justice and three counts of making false statements.",
      "Tarrio attended Lamond's sentencing and later called for Trump to pardon Lamond.",
      "\u201cI ask that the Justice Department and the President of the United States step in and correct the injustice that I just witnessed inside this courtroom,\" Tarrio said outside the courthouse after the sentencing.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a four-year prison sentence for Lamond.",
      "\u201cBecause Lamond knew what he did was wrong, he lied to cover it up \u2014 not just to the Federal Agents who questioned his actions, but to this Court,\" they wrote. \"This is an egregious obstruction of justice and a betrayal of the work of his colleagues at MPD.\u201d",
      "Lamond's lawyers argued that a prison sentence isn't warranted.",
      "\"Mr. Lamond gained nothing from his communications with Mr. Tarrio and only sought, albeit in a sloppy and ineffective way, to gain information and intelligence that would help stop the violent protesters coming to D.C. in late 2020, early 2021,\" they wrote.",
      "Tarrio pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020. He was arrested two days before dozens of Proud Boys members stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Tarrio wasn't at the Capitol that day, but a jury convicted him of orchestrating a violent plot to keep President Donald Trump in the White House after he lost the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond testified at his bench trial that he never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio, who testified as a witness for Lamond\u2019s defense, said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and did not receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find either man\u2019s testimony to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "\u201cIt was the other way around,\u201d she said.",
      "Lamond, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department\u2019s Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Prosecutors said Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed. They pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with real-time updates on the police investigation.",
      "Lamond\u2019s indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\u201cOf course I can\u2019t say it officially, but personally I support you all and don\u2019t want to see your group\u2019s name and reputation dragged through the mud,\u201d Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \u201csympathizer\u201d who acted as a \u201cdouble agent\u201d for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t support the Proud Boys, and I\u2019m not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\u201d Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",

      "Nearly 1 in 5 positions across the Food and Drug Administration's human food inspection divisions are now vacant, multiple agency officials tell CBS News, in the wake of departures encouraged by the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts and a government-wide hiring freeze that had stalled efforts to replenish their ranks.",
      "While the FDA has long struggled with hiring and retaining qualified investigators to inspect food producers and distributors, multiple federal health officials \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity and were not authorized to speak to the press \u2014 say that the staffing gap has worsened due to early retirements and resignations.",
      "\"The FDA remains fully capable of fulfilling its public health mission to protect the safety of the American people. Under Commissioner Makary's leadership, the agency continues to meet its inspection obligations, ensuring that all facilities are reviewed within mandated timeframes,\" Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has claimed in interviews that no inspectors were laid off at the agency as a result of the sweeping restructuring ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that began in April, but has not acknowledged the retirements and resignations.",
      "And despite Makary's statements, multiple FDA officials said they are worried about worsening attrition in the agency's ranks of investigators.",
      "\"They're not going to admit our mission is at risk and we're missing timeframes, even though I've heard that's happening,\" a current FDA official told CBS News in a message.",

      "\"Since 2017, our ability to fulfill its public health mission is increasingly constrained by reduced inspectional capacity. We continue to face significant obstacles in recruiting and retaining qualified investigators, particularly in the foods program, where nearly 90 investigative positions remain vacant,\" the agency said last month in response to a draft of a report by the HHS inspector general.",
      "The inspector general had concluded that the FDA would need to increase inspections by more than 3,000 each year, in order to meet its goals. Under requirements laid out by Congress, the FDA is required to inspect food facilities at specific intervals, benchmarks that government watchdogs have long faulted the agency for falling short of.",
      "\"For FDA to meet the inspection timeframes moving forward, it would need to inspect approximately 7,000 high-risk facilities each year. However, FDA inspected only about 58 percent of that amount,\" the inspector general's June 2025 report said.",
      "Around 40% of investigator positions are vacant for the group of investigators tasked with inspecting \"critical foods\" like infant formula plants, a current official said.",
      "\"Critical foods has had difficulty with staffing because every inspection is high profile and the team is traveling more often than not. It isn't sustainable for everyone,\" a former FDA official said.",
      "The job of an FDA investigator has gotten harder in recent months, as the Trump administration imposed additional hurdles to make small purchases necessary for their work, ranging from buying everyday supplies to shipping samples, officials said.",
      "\"The reality is that the extra steps in budget approval processes have caused inspections to be delayed, and investigators have had to take on administrative tasks that eat into their time being productive. Everything was taking longer,\" the former FDA official said.",
      "Many administrative staff and laboratory scientists supporting the FDA's food inspectors were also eliminated through layoffs, resulting in backlogs of testing and reimbursements. Some have since been reinstated by the agency.",
      "One current and one former FDA official said the agency also had many investigators that were in the process of being hired months ago, before attempts to fill the slots were blocked by an order signed by President Trump that now extends through July 15.",
      "Multiple officials said Friday morning they were hopeful that the Trump administration might grant an exemption to the hiring freeze after weeks of lobbying by officials within the agency.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-surge-early-cdc-tracking-new-strain/",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "Alaska Airlines\u00a0is canceling more than a dozen flights a day as tariffs hinder its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft, according to the carrier.",
      "The Seattle, Washington-based airline said it wouldn't immediately accept delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets in order to avoid incurring the extra tariff-related costs. The aircraft were meant to serve Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda has upended\u00a0supply chains for a range of businesses, and has forced many companies to raise prices on consumers in order to protect their margins. The aviation industry has also warned that the levies will affect its business.",
      "\"We deeply regret the impact this situation will have on our guests this summer,\" Alaska Airlines said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday.",
      "\"Amid the ongoing uncertain economic environment, we are focused on controlling what we can control \u2014 including costs, productivity, operational performance and taking care of our guests to the best of our ability. As part of this effort to control our costs, Alaska will not accept additional costs imposed by tariffs throughout our supply chain,\" it added.",
      "Without the new aircraft, Alaska said it must cancel 14 flights a day through the end of July. Horizon operates all of its flights on Embraer jets. Alaska operates an all-Boeing fleet.",
      "The delayed aircraft were expected to arrive from Brazil in May. Brazilian imports to the United States have been subject to a 10% tariff since April.",
      "Delta Air Lines also took steps to avoid paying tariffs on new aircraft earlier this year. In April, it had new Airbus A350 airlines delivered from France to Japan, and flew the planes internationally first, before bringing them to the U.S. Because the aircraft were not new on arrival in the U.S., the airline was not on the hook for paying tariffs on them.",
      "Which routes is Alaska canceling?",
      "The new planes had been scheduled to arrive by the end of May and were expected to go into service during the summer season for Horizon, which serves the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah and western Canada.",

      "\"When deciding which flights to cancel, we put our guests at the center of consideration. We don't take these decisions lightly as we know it means disruption for our guests and their travel plans.

    "summary": "Small businesses are reducing labor costs as tariffs put pressure on their bottom lines. Big businesses could be next.",
    "story": [
      "Some small business owners say they are pulling back on hiring as tariff-driven cost increases make bringing on new employees\u00a0an untenable proposition.",
      "As they bear added expenses on imported inputs and goods, companies are looking to trim costs wherever possible, including labor. That can mean pressing pause on hiring, cutting workers' hours and even laying off staff, business owners say. Smaller enterprises often preempt bigger corporations in reducing their headcount, as they typically have less financial cushion to tide them over during downturns and periods of economic uncertainty.",
      "Mike Roach, owner of Paloma Clothing, a men's and women's boutique in Portland, Oregon, told CBS MoneyWatch that while he has not yet laid off any salespeople, he is cutting down on labor-related spending.",
      "\"We are not hiring and [are] trying to shave anyone's hours who is willing and able,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Roach said he is looking for ways to save in order to make up for a 22% drop in profit in May, compared with the same period a year ago. He attributes the drop in earnings to weaker consumer demand amid rising prices and general economic uncertainty.",
      "\"I am tired of breaking even\"",
      "Shayai Lucero is the owner of Earth & Sky Floral Designs, a one-woman floral shop in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She had hoped to hire a worker this summer to help alleviate her heavy workload, but cost increases related to tariffs now make that impossible.",
      "\"I was looking at hiring somebody to handle the more minor tasks of the business, so I could streamline my own goals better,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But I am in a place where I can't even afford to hire one person.\"",
      "Lucero said tariffs have driven up wholesale flower prices so drastically that she has been forced to charge her customers more and can't raise prices any further without scaring away business. \"My clientele can't afford for me to keep increasing prices, and I am tired of breaking even,\" she said.",
      "Drop in hiring",
      "The share of small business owners planning to create new jobs over the next three months fell to 12% in May, from 13% in April, data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) May jobs report shows.",
      "\"Amid uncertainty, small business owners' hiring plans remain subdued in May,\" Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at NFIB,\u00a0said in a statement. \"Compensation pressures have also eased, offering some much needed relief for many owners.\"",
      "Labor costs, the top concern of business owners according to the NFIB report, rose one point in May, to 9%.",
      "Experts say the moderation in hiring makes sense given the current economic environment.",
      "\"Bottom line, should we really be surprised by the slowing hiring pace in light of all the macro challenges we keep hearing about and not helped by the tariff costs, confusion and volatility with its uses?\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, wrote in a blog post. \"Just put yourself in the shoes of an employer and we can understand the hesitancy that so many business people have, especially small businesses that just don't have the flexibility that larger companies have to adjust, nor the finances.\"",
      "NFIB Executive Director Holly Wade said a number of small business owners are foregoing filling open positions given their heightened sensitivity to labor costs.",
      "\"Keeping them on payroll is a significant part of expenses, and their margins are a lot more sensitive to that than their larger counterparts,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are certainly looking to try to absorb those higher costs any way they can, and one way is on the labor front.\"",
      "Not only are many small enterprises scrapping plans to grow their labor forces, they're also shedding jobs,\u00a0data\u00a0released this week from payroll processor ADP shows.",
      "Establishments with fewer than 50 employees lost 13,000 jobs in May, according to a report released Thursday by ADP's National Employment, an independent measure of employment changes at private companies.",
      "No certainty, no hires",
      "Ken Giddon, owner of Rothman's, a men's clothing store with roughly 30 employees who work across three locations in New York, said much of his plans have \"been put on hold\" as tariffs erode confidence.",
      "\"We probably would have added a person or two this year, and now we are not. Tariffs threw a whole wrench in the thing. They took away the optimism, they took away the certainty,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Nikki Bravo, owner of Momentum Coffee, a small chain of coffee shops in Chicago, is also hesitant to bring on new workers. Bravo employs 12 people across five locations, a number that usually swells to more than 20 in the summertime, she said. In addition to hiring seasoned workers, Bravo typically likes to give opportunities to people who have trouble finding employment because they're inexperienced, or for other reasons.",
      "Yet she's had to pull back on that initiative, too.",
      "\"When you have economic uncertainty, we need to have more certainty in our hires,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So I have to select people with more experience. I can't take risks on unproven folks, and that's unfortunate because part of our mission is to give back and work with the community.\"",
      "This year, Bravo plans to hire about eight additional workers to accommodate the summer crowds, while in past years she would've brought on up to 13. But the jump in her other costs, including on coffee and packaging materials, has put such hiring on ice.",
      "\"It's coffee, so we can't keep putting that off to the customer, because they're only going to spend so much,\" Bravo told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So we have to look at other ways to reduce our costs and keep them steady.\"",

    "summary": "We asked three experts what fresh college graduates can do to prepare as artificial intelligence changes how Americans work. Here's what they said.",
    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, new federal data shows, a sign the labor market remains steady despite economic headwinds from tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Payroll gains in May exceeded economists' consensus forecast of 130,000. Job growth over the last 12 months has averaged 156,800 per month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2% for the third month in a row, according to the Labor Department. That\u00a0matched forecasts\u00a0by economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Although the government's latest employment report topped expectations, job growth was slightly weaker in May compared with previous months. The Labor Department on Friday revised April payroll gains down to 147,000, from an initial estimate of 177,000",
      "Stocks rose on Friday following the better-than-expected report. The S&P 500 was up 64 points, or 1.1% as of 10:57 a.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 464 points, or 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%.",
      "What it means",
      "While job growth in May was modestly weaker than in previous months, the data suggests the job market is holding up\u00a0despite concerns about the impact of higher U.S. import tariffs. Still, economists warn the economy could slow in the coming months.",
      "The jobs numbers reflect a labor market that is \"steady but cautious in the face of ongoing uncertainty,\" Ger Doyle, regional president at global workforce solutions company ManpowerGroup, said in a report.",
      "Health care companies, along with the leisure and hospitality industry, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 62,000 and 48,000 jobs, respectively. Federal employment declined 22,000 in May and is down 59,000 since January, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Other\u00a0employment data\u00a0released this week hinted at a potential slowdown in the labor market, with firms pulling back on hiring and announcing layoffs amid tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Unemployment claims last week ticked up to their highest level in eight months, Labor Department data shows. The biggest increase in unemployment claims was in Kentucky, followed by the District of Columbia and Nebraska, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from WalletHub.",
      "However, the latest jobs report suggests the labor market isn't about to crumble, let alone point to an imminent recession, analysts said.",

      "\"Investors will breathe a sigh of relief at the 139K figure, but the details of the release suggest that growth storm clouds are darkening,\" wrote Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a research note.",
      "For borrowers, the solid job gains and steady unemployment rate are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines for at least the next few months, economists said. The Fed is scheduled to meet next June 17-18. The central bank has kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged this year after cutting it three times last year.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell and most other Fed policymakers have voiced concern that Trump's tariffs could push up inflation later this year, which they would seek to counter by raising interest rates.",
      "\"In our view, the labor market is not showing the type of weakness that the Fed would need to see in order to consider cutting rates,\" at its June meeting, Brian Rose, senior U.S. economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in a client note. \"We expect to see further softening in the second half of 2025 as tariffs and other policy measures weigh more heavily on the economy, leading the Fed to start cutting rates in September.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-pride-celebrations-corporate-sponsor-cancellations/",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The organizers of prominent Pride celebrations saw huge sponsorship drop-offs this year, a pattern seen as a response to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years.",
      "The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain.",
      "\"We're going to make it to the event,\" said Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, who told CBS News five corporate sponsors cut ties with the organization over the course of one overwhelming week in March and several others reduced their funding. \"The real question now is, what kind of shape are we going to be in on the other side of Pride? Are we going to be able to keep the doors open?\"",
      "Corporate partners that backed out of San Francisco Pride this year were historically among its largest and most reliable donors, including Nissan Comcast/Xfinity and Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch. Along with Target, Bud Light has faced public backlash and boycotts over its Pride advertising in recent years.",
      "\"That hurt us greatly,\" Ford said of losing Anheuser-Busch, previously \"one of the very largest\" sponsors of San Francisco Pride. \"Comcast and Nissan have been significant and have been longtime partners. They've been with us for a long time, so it was money that we've counted on.\"",
      "Their retreats meant San Francisco Pride was operating at a loss of about $300,000, which Ford hopes will shrink to about $200,000 once increased donations are factored in from other sponsors, who raised their pledges to narrow the gaps left by the bigger brands. Two large corporate partners, Benefit Cosmetics and La Crema, initially dropped their sponsorship contracts but have since returned as partners, Ford said.",
      "Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities. Anheuser-Busch, known for decades as a supporter of the LGBTQ community, also declined to sponsor the 2025 Pride Festival in its hometown of St. Louis,\u00a0according to that event's organizers. The company had been one of their leading sponsors for the last 30 years, the organizer's said.",
      "Pride Month was originally conceived as a way to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots, which are credited with kick-starting the modern gay rights movement, and it has evolved since then into a multifaceted celebration of the LGBTQ community. Local Pride plans typically involve multiday event rosters with at least one march, parade or festival, which are intermittently known to draw a million or more attendees.",
      "Celebrations around Pride grew tremendously over the last decade or so, organizers say, in large part because of an influx of corporate sponsorships cropping up after the U.S. legalized marriage equality in 2015. The upward trend in brand support was so steep for a period of time that some sponsors were\u00a0accused of exploiting LGBTQ issues\u00a0for the purpose of turning a profit.",
      "That trend looked very different this year, as corporate sponsors around the country either withdrew their support for Pride festivities or significantly scaled it back. Many attributed their decisions to financial strain or internal transitions, according to statements from several companies and organizers who recalled their conversations to CBS News.",
      "\"Nissan is currently reviewing all marketing and sales spending \u2014 including select consumer auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations \u2014 to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness,\" a Nissan spokesperson said of the brand breaking partnerships with Pride organizers in San Francisco as well as New York City.",
      "But organizers and supporters see a pattern in the sponsorship cancellations, which some consider implicit byproducts of the Trump administration's\u00a0anti-DEI policies and ongoing\u00a0attacks on transgender Americans. Ron de Harte, the co-president of the Board of Directors at USA Prides, a national network of Pride organizations, said the decline in national brand sponsorships for Pride events is widespread this year.",
      "\"This is happening with festival and event sponsorships across the board,\" said de Harte in a statement. \"Of course, bad economic times are coupled with the current administration's unfriendly actions toward the LGBTQ communities, so some markets have sponsors who have moved on.\"",
      "As the Capital Pride Alliance organized WorldPride this year in Washington, D.C., it grappled with a litany of complications leading up to this weekend's international gathering. After President Trump took over the Kennedy Center, multiple WorldPride events were either canceled or relocated under new leadership. In addition, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, a major federal contractor, backed out of its 2025 WorldPride contract in a move that critics thought bent to government pressure.",
      "A spokesperson for Capital Pride Alliance said Booz Allen was the only WorldPride sponsor that canceled a finalized contract, but others dropped out in various stages of the sponsorship process, including Comcast/Xfinity, Deloitte and Visa. The spokesperson said some brands became \"silent partners,\" which means they donate in the background but avoid the publicity that can come with outright sponsorship.",
      "Matt Cheng, the director of corporate sponsorships at Heritage of Pride, the nonprofit that produces New York City Pride events, told CBS News that its corporate partners gave various explanations for decreasing or eliminating support. Economic weariness was among them, he said, along with fear of retaliation.",
      "\"One of the big ones is the tariffs and economy. A lot of budgets have gotten slashed from a DEI and marketing perspective,\" he said. \"But then the other one is fear of backlash from the federal government.\"",
      "Heritage of Pride lost roughly one-quarter of its sponsorship dollars, or about $750,000, in the last few months. Large companies like Deutsche Bank ramped up their earlier donations to organizations because of the shortfall, and a poll of about 100 individual donors recently gave $10,000 or so, Cheng said. He hoped New York City Pride fundraisers would bring them closer to zero losses.",
      "\"In addition to reviewing our budget lines to make sure we can afford to put on Pride the way that it typically is put on, our other concern is our year-round programming,\" he said.",
      "More immediately, a 25% budget gap would likely require Heritage of Pride to cut their only two grant programs, both of which support at-risk communities, Cheng added.",
      "Like San Francisco, St. Louis and WorldPride in D.C., New York City Pride also lost large sponsors. Nissan and PepsiCo both pulled support from Heritage of Pride after previously being top donors, according to public partnership information released last year and Kevin Kilbride, the media and marketing manager at the nonprofit. Other sponsors have reduced their funding but are still planning to march in the upcoming Manhattan parade, Kilbride said.",
      "Target has remained a silent partner of New York City Pride. Kilbride said Target continues to be \"a valued partner\" and its sponsorship this year was \"at a level consistent with years' past.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely dedicated to fostering inclusivity for everyone \u2014 our team members, our guests, our supply partners, and the more than 2,000 communities we're proud to serve,\" a Target spokesperson said in a statement. \"As we have for many years, we will continue to mark Pride Month by offering an assortment of celebratory products, hosting internal programming to support our incredible team and sponsoring local events in neighborhoods across the country.\"",

    "summary": "Roughly a quarter of consumers use \"buy now, pay later\" loans for ordinary expenses like groceries. That's worrisome, a personal finance expert says.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of consumers are taking out \"buy now, pay later,\" or BNPL, loans to cover everyday living expenses, data shows, a sign of the precarious financial state facing many U.S. households.",
      "A quarter of Americans now use BNPL loans to pay for groceries, up 14% from last year, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. The personal finance firm also found that more people are using such financing to pay for clothing, technology and housewares.",
      "BNPL loans \u2014 which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple \u2014 let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The most common BNPL loans are \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks.",
      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",

    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "In a letter to Rubio as acting national security adviser and obtained by CBS News, Warren said Mr. Trump and Musk's public disagreements about the upcoming reconciliation bill that escalated into a public online spat could \"have serious implications for U.S. national security.\"",
      "The Massachusetts Democrat mentioned Mr. Trump's proposal to terminate Musk's government contracts and subsidies, which the world's richest man followed with a threat that SpaceX would \"begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\" Musk has since walked back his threat.",

      "\"I'm too busy doing other things,\" Trump continued. \"You know, I won an election in a landslide. I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration, and saved his life in my first administration, I have no intention of speaking to him.\"",

      "This isn't the first time the president has needled Musk over his companies' federal subsidies. In a 2022 feud, Mr. Trump claimed Musk would be \"worthless\" without hefty subsidies for \"electric cars that don't drive long enough\" and \"rocketships to nowhere.\"",

    "story": [
      "Many undocumented immigrants who went to their Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointments at a federal building in Los Angeles this week were taken into custody and brought to the basement and held there, some overnight, according to immigration lawyers and family members.",
      "It was unclear how many people were affected, but the attorneys told CBS News hundreds of immigrants were detained \u2014 dozens in the basement in rooms that could fit up to 30 at a time.",
      "One attorney, Lizbeth Mateo, said ICE officials slated several of her clients for check-ins at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in downtown L.A. but when they showed up on Tuesday, they were detained and immediately escorted to the basement.",
      "Mateo said a couple and their two children, one of whom is a U.S. citizen, spent the night in a room with no beds and limited access to food and water. Mateo said the father had previously been issued a stay of removal, barring him from deportation but he and his family were detained anyway. His wife was released Wednesday evening along with their children since she needed medical attention due to a high-risk pregnancy. He was still being detained early Friday, Mateo said.",
      "\"This is something I've never seen before,\" she added. \"Under the first Trump administration, I represented clients with very difficult cases, but never anything like this. Under any other circumstance, he would have been released.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, a spokesperson for ICE said the agency \"categorically refutes the assertions made by immigration activists in Los Angeles. ICE takes very seriously it's mandate to care for people in their custody with dignity and as mandated by law. Inaccurate statements pushing a false narrative do nothing but put ICE law enforcement personnel and our communities at risk while distorting our mission of public safety and secure borders.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a separate statement Friday that those arrested \"had executable final orders of removal by an immigration judge and had not complied with that order. If you are in the country illegally and a judge has ordered you to be removed, that is precisely what will happen. During the Biden administration, thousands of illegal aliens\u2014including violent criminals\u2014with final orders of removal were on ATD (alternatives to detention) and allowed to roam our communities. This should never have been the case. Thanks to the leadership of Secretary Noem and President Trump, the proper policy is back in place.\"",
      "In a follow-up statement, DHS directed CBS News to the previous statement, which had been issued by the ICE spokesperson.",
      "ICE said Saturday that 44 people were administratively arrested and there was one arrest for obstruction. The arrests spurred\u00a0large-scale and tense protests throughout the city. ICE acting Director Todd Lyons said in a statement over 1,000 rioters surrounded and attacked a federal building.",
      "\"These violent rioters will be held accountable if they harm federal officers, and make no mistake, ICE will continue to enforce our nation's immigration laws and arrest criminal illegal aliens,\" Lyons said.",
      "On Thursday evening, CBS News spoke to people waiting outside the building who claimed they had relatives in the basement who were texting them.",
      "\"We are telling them that we are waiting for them outside and to remain calm,\" a woman using the name Maria to protect her identity told CBS News. \"We just want to make sure their children, my nieces, have food.\"",
      "Maria said her brother was in the basement along with his wife and their two children \u2014 they'd been scheduled for an ICE check-in on Thursday morning. Their asylum requests had previously been denied in court. The family was apparently still being held early Friday.",
      "Immigration lawyers said it was also unclear why people were being held in that basement.",
      "\"They're having to literally house these immigrants in a makeshift detention center, which on its face is illegal,\" said Juan Proa\u00f1o, chief executive officer of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). \"It is beyond inhumane treatment for any immigrant and in this particular case, you're talking about families.\"",
      "CBS News obtained\u00a0internal government data\u00a0showing arrests by ICE during President Trump's second term topped 100,000 this week, as federal agents intensified efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants in courthouses, worksites and communities across the U.S.",
      "ICE recorded more than 2,000 arrests on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, a dramatic increase from the daily average of 660 arrests reported by the agency during Mr. Trump's first 100 days back at the White House, the federal statistics show. During former President Joe Biden's last year in office, ICE averaged roughly 300 daily arrests, according to agency data.",
      "The latest numbers show ICE is getting closer to meeting the demands of top administration officials like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner who has forcefully pushed the agency to make \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests each day.",
      "\"The Trump administration, DHS, ICE have gotten way ahead of themselves. They haven't necessarily planned this properly and don't have the capacity required in order to continue with these large-scale deportations,\" Proa\u00f1o asserted.",

      "The relationship between Mr. Trump and Musk broke down publicly last week, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him.",
      "Musk, the world's richest person, had spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates, CBS News previously reported.

      "Vance says Musk's attacks were a \"huge mistake\"",
      "Vance expressed his support for Mr. Trump, saying Musk was making a \"huge mistake\" going after Mr. Trump in a storm of bitter and inflammatory social media posts after a falling out between the two men.",
      "But the vice president, in an interview released Friday after the very public blow-up between the world's richest man and arguably the world's most powerful, also tried to downplay Musk's blistering attacks as an \"emotional guy\" who got frustrated.",
      "Musk attacked Mr. Trump in a torrent of social media posts, first criticizing the president's spending package and then targeting him with more direct attacks. Mr. Trump then portrayed Musk as disgruntled and \"CRAZY\" and threatened to cut the government contracts held by Musk's businesses. Trump ally Steve Bannon called for an investigation into Musk's immigration status and alleged drug use.",
      "During an interview with comedian Theo Von, Vance said he hopes that \"eventually Elon comes back into the fold,\" but said it might not be \"possible now because he's gone so nuclear.\" The interview was taped on Thursday as Musk's posts were unfurling on X, the social media network the billionaire owns.",
      "\"Look, it happens to everybody,\" Vance said in the interview. \"I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.\"",
      "The vice president told Von that as Musk for days was calling on social media for Congress to kill Mr. Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" the president was \"getting a little frustrated, feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon, but I think has been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk.\"",
      "\"I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,\" he added.",
      "Vance's comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men to mend fences. Just weeks ago, Mr. Trump and Musk were close allies, spending significant time together while the billionaire served as a special advisor to the president and led the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE.",

      "In February, the Department of Justice gave a group of right-wing influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" but the influencers later said that there was little new information in the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi later shared the documents widely and said the first phase \"largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government.\" She said more documents would be forthcoming, but there have been no other releases since.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March, has been indicted and brought back to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported back to his home country, has been returned to the U.S. to face two federal criminal counts that were detailed in an indictment unsealed on Friday.",
      "Filed in the federal district court in Nashville, the indictment charges Abrego Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. in March and flown to El Salvador, where he was initially held at a notorious supermax prison.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in remarks Friday at the Justice Department that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges after it was presented with an arrest warrant.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,\" Bondi said, adding: \"This is what American justice looks like.\"",
      "ABC News first reported Friday that he was being brought back to the U.S. to face the charges.",
      "In a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday, President Trump seemed to distance himself from the decision to return the Maryland father to the U.S., saying \"that wasn't my decision.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice decided to do it in that way, and that's fine,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he felt confident that there is a \"very easy case\" against Abrego Garcia.",
      "A federal grand jury returned the indictment on May 21. The Justice Department said in a court filing that Abrego Garcia should be held in pretrial custody because \"he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.\"",
      "Bondi said the grand jury found that Abrego Garcia \"played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring\" that involved children and women and is \"a danger to our community.\" If Abrego Garcia is convicted, he would serve his sentence in the U.S. and then return to El Salvador, according to the attorney general.",
      "In her remarks, Bondi strayed beyond what was alleged in the indictment, claiming that Abrego Garcia played a role in the murder of a rival gang member's mother and solicited naked pictures from a minor. Neither of those allegations appear in the charging documents.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in a statement that due process \"means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice.\" He said the government \"disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.\"",
      "During a brief news conference Friday, Sandoval-Moshenberg added that Abrego Garcia is \"not going to be convicted of these crimes.\"",
      "\"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" he said.",
      "Abrego Garcia made an initial court appearance on Friday and remains in the custody of U.S. Marshals. His next hearing was scheduled for June 13.",
      "The indictment",
      "The filing alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia and others conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the southern border into Texas.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia and an unidentified co-conspirator picked up the migrants in Houston and transported them to other parts of the U.S., and devised \"cover stories\" to give to law enforcement in the event they were stopped \u2014 like transporting people for construction work.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia and six co-conspirators used cellphones and social media platforms to move migrants into and throughout the U.S. He allegedly worked with two of the co-conspirators to transport firearms that were purchased illegally in Texas for distribution and resale in Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived.",
      "Abrego Garcia and the six others also allegedly collected financial payments from migrants for their movements, according to the indictment. That money was then transferred between one another, the Justice Department said, claiming it was an effort to hide their origins.",
      "The indictment claims that Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators \"knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands\" of migrants who were not legally authorized to live or work in the U.S., and alleges that many of those people were members of the gang MS-13 and associates.",
      "The filing includes information about a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. The agency released body camera footage from the incident.",
      "Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped. He said that they had been performing construction work at a site in St. Louis, Missouri. An April report from the Department of Homeland Security about the incident said Aberego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime.",
      "What happened in Friday's hearing",
      "Abrego Garcia was escorted into the Nashville courtroom Friday by two Homeland Security Investigations agents. Both sat at opposite ends of him during the hearing.",
      "Abrego Garcia, in a white-colored, short-sleeved button-down shirt and jeans, appeared confused and tired during the hearing, and mostly kept his head down while waiting for Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to enter the courtroom.",
      "He remained mostly stoic for the full length of the hearing, making no notable facial expressions or showing any strong emotion.",
      "His attorney, a public defender, noted that he had little time to speak with his client beforehand, and said he had only received a copy of the indictment in English. The attorney said he had been working to have the entire indictment read to Abrego Garcia in Spanish, but \"only made it halfway\" through before Abrego Garcia was escorted into the courtroom.",
      "The judge said she intends to set a detention hearing for next week. Abrego Garcia's attorney argued he should be released from custody, saying the Justice Department did not prove the defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the community.",
      "Following a lengthy recess and discussion, Holmes decided Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals until his next hearing on June 13 at 11 a.m. ET.",
      "Holmes said that hearing will serve to determine if prosecutors have the basis to request a detention hearing in the first place, and if so, that hearing will also serve as a detention hearing and his arraignment.",
      "Abrego Garcia's deportation",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked nationwide backlash after an immigration official in the Trump administration acknowledged that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" The 29-year-old had been granted a legal status in 2019, known as withholding of removal, that forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among the more than 200 people who were boarded onto planes bound for El Salvador in mid-March for confinement in the country's notorious maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. The removals were part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, which have prompted numerous legal battles across the country.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who had lived in Maryland since he came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011, was initially held at CECOT but eventually moved to a lower-security facility, according to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador in April. The State Department later confirmed he had been transferred.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said Friday that Abrego Garcia \"is one of the first, if not the first person\" to leave CECOT and he was curious to hear about his treatment there.",
      "\"So it's going to be very interesting to hear what he has to say about the way in which he was treated in that prison by the Salvadoran authorities, especially his first days in that prison before the Salvadoran government realized that he was special in the object of attention in the United States,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "Van Hollen on Friday said that the Trump administration has for months been flouting the Supreme Court and the Constitution.",
      "\"Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States,\" he said in a statement. \"As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights \u2014 and the rights of all. The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case, and U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis' orders for the government to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. was the catalyst for an escalating clash between the Trump administration and the courts that has played out over the past few weeks. The government was accused of defying Xinis' demand that it facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody \u2014 which was affirmed by the Supreme Court \u2014 and refusing to provide any details about what efforts it had taken to do so.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing an allegation from a confidential informant and the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested in 2019, after which he was released from custody. His lawyers have denied that Abrego Garcia has any ties to MS-13, and said he has never been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "Legal battle goes to Supreme Court",
      "Three courts \u2014 the district court on which Xinis sits, a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court \u2014 all said the Trump administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody. The Supreme Court also directed the government to ensure that his case \"is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "But lawyers for Abrego Garcia said the administration has defied those decisions by repeatedly refusing to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. or provide any information about whether it has even made attempts to do so.",
      "In response, Xinis ordered an expedited examination into the Trump administration's refusal to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and allowed his lawyers to pose 15 questions to government officials and make 15 requests for documents.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers told Xinis that the Trump administration turned over \"nothing of substance\" and provided \"non-responsive\" answers to their questions. The judge then blasted the administration for its responses and blamed it for \"continued mischaracterization\" of the Supreme Court's order. She said their objection to certain requests for information \"reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Regarding the administration's attempts to invoke certain privileges to shield certain details from Abrego Garcia's lawyers, the judge said they rely on \"boilerplate assertions.\"",
      "\"That ends now,\" Xinis wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk publicly mused about creating a new political party this week, an idea that could escalate the billionaire's feud with his onetime ally President Trump.",
      "Musk first floated the idea on Thursday. In between jabs at Mr. Trump, the billionaire posted a poll to X asking his 220 million followers if they think it's \"time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle.\"",
      "A day later, Musk noted that\u00a080% of respondents to the poll backed the idea.",
      "\"This is fate,\" he wrote Friday evening.",
      "Musk then endorsed a fan's suggestion that he name it the \"America Party.\" The name bears a resemblance to America PAC, the political action committee founded by Musk last year that was his main vehicle for spending $239 million to help elect Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in 2024.",
      "Starting a new political party is easier said than done. The Democratic and Republican parties, and some of the larger third parties, already have ballot access in virtually every state, so an upstart party that hopes to be competitive would need to navigate a web of state-by-state rules to get its candidates on the ballot.",
      "And while Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 is legally allowed to pour unlimited money into his America PAC because it is organized as an independent super PAC, donations to formal political parties are capped at well under $1 million, per the Federal Election Commission's contribution limits for 2025-2026 federal elections.",
      "It's not clear how serious Musk is about the idea of breaking with the Republican Party. Later Friday, the billionaire replied \"Ok\" to a person who argued \"the best bang for your buck\" is to get involved in GOP primaries. He also seemed to entertain a post that suggested reforming one of the main parties \"from the inside out\" instead of starting a third party, replying \"Hmm.\"",
      "Still, Musk's musings about starting a new political party could signal he plans to stay engaged in politics, and may try to challenge Mr. Trump's influence.",
      "Musk said last month he planned on dialing back his political spending generally, saying at the time that he didn't \"see a reason\" to keep putting his money into politics, though he left open the possibility of getting involved again. His time leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency also came to an end last week, with Mr. Trump publicly expressing support.",
      "But Musk began directly challenging Mr. Trump on Tuesday, calling the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 a sprawling domestic policy bill backed by Mr. Trump \u2014 a \"disgusting abomination\" and urging lawmakers to vote against it. The two men publicly sparred on Thursday, with Mr. Trump threatening to cut off subsidies to Musk's companies, while Musk claimed the president was ungrateful for the hundreds of millions he poured into helping the 2024 Trump campaign.",
      "Musk entered the congressional fray at a delicate moment for the GOP. The party's domestic policy bill narrowly passed the House last month, but it still needs to go through the Senate, and if the upper chamber makes any changes, it will need to head back to the House again.",
      "Musk offered a pointed suggestion Thursday afternoon to any congressional Republicans who may be unsure of whether to side with him or the president, writing on X: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\"",

Both of the judges who ruled in the administration's favor were nominated by President Trump in his first term.",
      "\"We grant in part the government's motion for a stay pending appeal,\" Judge Gregory Katsas and Judge Neomi Rao wrote. \"The White House is likely to succeed on the merits because these restricted presidential spaces are not First Amendment fora opened for private speech and discussion. The White House therefore retains discretion to determine, including on the basis of viewpoint, which journalists will be admitted. Moreover, without a stay, the government will suffer irreparable harm because the injunction impinges on the president's independence and control over this private workspaces.\"",
      "The White House has already assumed control of the White House press pool access and rotation so that wire outlets, including the Associated Press, are not in spaces like Air Force One or the Oval Office as frequently as they once were.",
      "The AP, which says its news reporting reaches roughly 4 billion people daily,\u00a0filed its lawsuit\u00a0against three senior White House officials after it was\u00a0informed in February\u00a0that it would no longer be allowed in places like the Oval Office and on Air Force One as part of the press pool until the AP revised its influential Stylebook to use the name Gulf of America instead of Gulf of Mexico.",

Thousands of other journalists have never been afforded the opportunity to cover the President in these privileged spaces. Moving forward, we will continue to expand access to new media so that more people can cover the most transparent President in American history rather than just the failing legacy media.

    "summary": "In May, Hegseth ordered dismissal 75% of civilians working for Pentagon office that conducts live-fire tests of U.S. weapons systems.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's recent personnel cuts in the Pentagon office responsible for weapons testing has halted all work and cleared the way for potential layoffs at the Pentagon-funded think tank that supports it, the Institute for Defense Analyses, or IDA.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, the institute's president, retired Air Force Gen. Norton \"Norty\" Schwartz, told staff he'd received a notice on Monday \"terminating all IDA tasks\" for the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation \u2014 known inside the Pentagon as DOT&E.",
      "\"Leadership is working to assess the full range of implications of these contract actions,\" Schwartz wrote, adding that the loss of funding \"impacts all of IDA.\"",
      "He continued, \"With the loss of funding, we cannot sustain our current staffing levels as an organization \u2026 All of this is devastating for us as individuals and for the amazing work we have had the privilege to perform for so many years.\"",
      "Congress established DOT&E in 1983 out of growing concern that the Pentagon lacked a clear and independent view of how its weapons systems performed under real-world conditions. Lawmakers at the time had grown frustrated with the quality of oversight, believing both Congress and the Defense Department were being left in the dark about the true effectiveness of the military's most expensive investments. IDA provides technical expertise and analysis to support the weapons testing office.",
      "DOT&E, along with IDA, took up the mantle of testing and evaluating all Pentagon weapon systems. By law, no weapon system can proceed to full production without the office's signoff.",
      "But late last month, Hegseth made deep cuts to the weapons testing office, which has caused a ripple effect at IDA. In his memo, Hegseth called much of the office's work \"redundant\" and \"nonessential\" and said it had functions that \"do not support operational agility or resource efficiency.\"",
      "The directive made a sweeping reduction to the office's civilian workforce, cutting the civilian employee count from 118 to 30, with and 15 uniformed personnel, and one person in the Senior Executive Service position to lead the office. The memo also ended all contractor support to the office, such as the work done by\u00a0 IDA.",
      "Hegseth's memo said the cuts would save the Pentagon over $300 million per year. The cost to operate the office was roughly $377 million, according to Fiscal Year 2025 Pentagon budget documents.",
      "The IDA letter sent to staffers on Tuesday and marked \"For Internal IDA Use Only,\" said the agency had faced a sense of uncertainty for months but that IDA had viewed such an outcome as an \"unlikely event.\"",
      "CBS News was unable to determine how many IDA staffers will be impacted or what programs IDA was working on that were halted.",
      "The Fiscal Year 2025 Defense Department budget documents show DOT&E provides operational and live-fire testing and evaluation oversight for every major defense acquisition program. It's currently evaluating over 230 weapons systems that are at various stages of procurement.",
      "Contacted on Friday, Herman Phillips, the chief communications officer for IDA, confirmed to CBS News that IDA leadership has made the \"difficult decision to reduce the size of the workforce. However, IDA has not currently dismissed any staff,\" as they continue to evaluate the impact from Hegseth's directive.",
      "Robert Behler, a longtime test pilot who led DOT&E during the first Trump administration, told USNI News Monday that the cuts will prevent the office from fulfilling its congressional obligations, and ending funding for contractor support will hinder DOT&E's ability to carry out its oversight duties.",
      "\"I don't think they will have the resources to be able to accomplish all those tasks with only \u2026 a couple handfuls of people, 30 people. It's an enormous job, especially the annual report,\" Behler told USNI News. He was referring to a report, required by federal law, that summarizes the Defense Department's weapons testing and evaluation each year. The report for 2024 was 498 pages.",
      "During a roundtable discussion with reporters hosted by the Defense Writers Group on Wednesday, GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, was asked about Hegseth's cuts to the DOT&E.",
      "\"I have questions not only for the secretary and his team, and to an extent the National Security Council is involved in this, but also with stakeholders and experts around town as to the advisability of this, which would amount to a reversal of congressional policy,\" said Wicker.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday halted lower court orders that required the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to turn over information to a government watchdog group as part of a lawsuit that tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force has to comply with federal public records law.",
      "The order from the high court clears DOGE for now from having to turn over records related to its work and personnel, and keeps Amy Gleason, identified as its acting administrator, from having to answer questions at a deposition. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "\"The portions of the district court's April 15 discovery order that require the government to disclose the content of intra\u2013executive branch USDS recommendations and whether those recommendations were followed are not appropriately tailored,\" the court said in its order. \"Any inquiry into whether an entity is an agency for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act cannot turn on the entity's ability to persuade. Furthermore, separation of powers concerns counsel judicial deference and restraint in the context of discovery regarding internal executive branch communications.\"",
      "The Supreme Court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for more proceedings.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused the district court's order last month, which allowed the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's bid for emergency relief. A district judge had ordered DOGE to turn over documents to the group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, by June 3, and for Gleason's deposition to be completed by June 13.",
      "The underlying issue in the case involves whether DOGE is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. CREW argues that the cost-cutting task force wields \"substantial independent authority,\" which makes it a de facto agency that must comply with federal public records law.",
      "The Justice Department, however, disagrees and instead claims that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies on matters that are important to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "DOGE's agency status was not before the Supreme Court, though the high court may be asked to settle that matter in the future. Instead, the Trump administration had asked the justices to temporarily halt a district court's order that allowed CREW to gather certain information from DOGE as part of its effort to determine whether the task force is an advisory panel that is outside FOIA's scope or is an agency that is subject to the records law.",
      "The judge overseeing the dispute, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, had ordered DOGE to turn over certain documents to the watchdog group by June 3 and to complete all depositions, including of Gleason, by June 13.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered the creation of DOGE on his first day back in the White House as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. Since then, DOGE team members have fanned out to agencies across the executive branch and have been part of efforts to shrink the federal workforce and shutter entities like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Institute of Peace.",
      "DOGE has also attempted to gain access to sensitive databases kept by the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration and Office of Personnel Management, prompting legal battles.",
      "In an effort to learn more about DOGE's structure and operations, CREW submitted an expedited FOIA request to the task force. After it did not respond in a timely manner, CREW filed a lawsuit and sought a preliminary injunction to expedite processing of its records request. The organization argued that DOGE was exercising significant independent authority, which made it an agency subject to FOIA.",
      "Cooper granted CREW's request for a preliminary injunction in March and agreed that FOIA likely applies to DOGE because it is \"likely exercising substantial independent authority much greater than other [Executive Office of the President] components held to be covered by FOIA.\"",
      "He then allowed CREW to conduct limited information-gathering, which the watchdog group said aimed to determine whether DOGE is exercising substantial authority that would bring it within FOIA's reach. A federal appeals court ultimately declined to pause that order, requiring DOGE to turn over the documents sought by CREW.",
      "In seeking the Supreme Court's intervention, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said CREW is conducting a \"fishing expedition\" into DOGE's activities. He warned that if Cooper's order remains in place, several components of the White House, such as the offices of the chief of staff and national security adviser, would be subject to FOIA.",
      "\"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations \u2014 threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\"",
      "But lawyers for CREW told the Supreme Court in a filing that the Justice Department's position \"would require courts to blindly yield to the Executive's characterization\" of the authority and operations of a component of the Executive Office of the President.",
      "They said adopting the Trump administration's approach to DOGE would give the president \"free reign\" to create new entities within the Executive Office of the President that exercise substantial independent authority but are shielded from transparency laws.",
      "\"Courts would be forced to blindly accept the government's representations about an EOP unit's realworld operations, unable to test those representations through even limited discovery,\" CREW's lawyers wrote. \"It is that extreme position, not the discovery order, that would 'turn[] FOIA on its head.'\"",

In addition to Social Security numbers, the agency's systems house medical information, school records, employment histories and financial data, among other records.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander concluded in April that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Social Security Administration's decision to give DOGE access to millions of Americans' confidential information violated the Privacy Act and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She did allow DOGE team members to have access to redacted or anonymized information from the Social Security Administration, but only if they met certain conditions, such as undergoing trainings and background investigations.",
      "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined a Trump administration request to lift that injunction, and the Justice Department turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief.",
      "In asking the high court to lift the district court's injunction, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the block is forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "\"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "Sauer also argued that the district court did not have the legal authority to issue sweeping relief, which he said harmed \"urgent federal priorities\" and thwarted the executive branch's functions.",
      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Social Security Administration's efforts to give DOGE team members access to its data systems is a departure from the agency's commitment to data security.",
      "\"SSA granted unprecedented and sweeping access to the most sensitive information held by the government, doing so without acknowledging the sea change in their own practices and policies,\u00a0 without considering the reliance interests millions of Americans have in SSA continuing to preserve the confidence of their information, and without acknowledging or considering the risks posed by unauthorized DOGE Team access,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "The unions argued that their members' harm builds every day that DOGE has access to sensitive, personally identifiable information at the Social Security Administration, and said Americans' right to privacy is at stake.",
      "President Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House. The task force's employees have been dispatched to agencies across the executive branch as part of the president's plan to decrease the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's efforts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have sparked legal fights over whether the task force's members have been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's previous work with DOGE, before he left government service last week, led to its own set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

      "Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here:",
      "Trump \"not the right guy,\" Musk says in 2016",
      "The Tesla CEO praised Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies as \"the right ones\" in an interview with CNBC before the 2016 election.",
      "\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy,\" Musk said of Mr. Trump at the time. \"He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"",
      "\"I don't think this is the finest moment in our democracy,\" Musk added.",
      "Musk joins \u2014 and quits \u2014 Trump administration roles",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's first term began, Musk joined a handful of White House advisory boards, including Mr. Trump's \"manufacturing jobs council.\"",
      "But Musk left those roles just months later, citing Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords.",
      "\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk tweeted in June 2017.",
      "Musk continued to have a close relationship with the federal government, however, as his rocket company SpaceX has billions in contracts with NASA and other agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Musk at a 2020 SpaceX launch in Florida, saying at one point: \"I speak to him all the time. Great guy. He's one of our great brains. We like great brains. And Elon has done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Musk sours on Democrats in 2022 \u2014 but still feuds with Trump",
      "In May 2022, Musk said he was ending his support for Democrats because \"they have become the party of division & hate.\"",
      "\"So I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" Musk tweeted, later adding that he voted for Clinton in 2016 and former President Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "But just two months later, Musk suggested he didn't support Mr. Trump launching another run for the White House amid a public spat with the then-former president over the course of several days in July 2022. Mr. Trump called the Tesla CEO a \"b---s--- artist\" at a rally and said his companies would be \"worthless\" without federal backing, while Musk tweeted Mr. Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"",
      "Later in 2022, Musk purchased Twitter, now known as X, and quickly reinstated Mr. Trump's account, which had been suspended since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The reinstatement came four days after Mr. Trump announced his third run for the presidency after losing to Biden.",
      "In the Republican presidential primary, Musk initially threw his support behind one of Mr. Trump's rivals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In May 2023, the billionaire and the Floridian appeared together on a glitchy Twitter livestream to launch DeSantis' campaign.",
      "Musk endorses Trump in 2024, wields influence",
      "The tech billionaire formally endorsed Mr. Trump on July 13, 2024, moments after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "\"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk wrote alongside video of the bloodied presidential candidate raising his fist in the air as he was surrounded by Secret Service agents.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail and spent roughly $277 million to help elect him and other Republican candidates, mostly through a Musk-backed super PAC called America PAC, campaign finance records show.",
      "Mr. Trump shouted Musk out during his election night victory speech: \"A star is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's an amazing guy.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for a second term, Musk used his political influence in December 2024 to whip up outrage against a bipartisan spending bill and torpedo it days before a potential government shutdown.",
      "Musk joins Trump administration, spearheading DOGE",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was tasked with cutting federal government spending, but fell far short of Musk's $1 trillion goal.",
      "Musk quickly became a member of Mr. Trump's inner circle, participating in Cabinet meetings and traveling on Air Force One with his young son. Less than a month into his government service, Musk professed\u00a0on X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\"",
      "DOGE quickly gained vast influence within the Trump administration, slashing government staff and nearly dismantling some federal agencies.",
      "Musk and Mr. Trump appeared together in the Oval Office in February \u2014 with Musk's son in tow \u2014 and jointly answered questions from the press.",
      "Mr. Trump stood by Musk as some of his efforts drew backlash. In late February, a DOGE-backed email telling federal employees to report what they had accomplished in the preceding week sparked confusion in some agencies. During a Cabinet meeting days later, Mr. Trump called Musk \"tremendously successful\" and said people were \"thrilled\" with his performance \u2014 and said federal workers who haven't responded to the emails are \"on the bubble.\"",
      "When Tesla faced protests from Trump opponents, the president boosted Musk, climbing into a Tesla on the White House South Lawn in March and calling the car \"beautiful.\" Days prior, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he would \"buy a brand new Tesla\" as a show of support for Musk, who the president said was \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB.\"",
      "Musk clashed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in April over Mr. Trump's tariff strategy. Musk called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro said Tesla relies on \"cheap foreign parts.\" Mr. Trump's White House didn't take sides: \"Boys will be boys,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "In a late April Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump praised and thanked Musk \u2014 but suggested his time in government would end soon.",

      "Days before wrapping up his work for the federal government, Musk began criticizing a massive piece of legislation aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Musk told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" in the price tag of the package, which would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back clean energy tax credits.",
      "Musk left his position in the administration on May 30 after reaching the maximum number of days he could serve as a special government employee. Musk, who had a black eye, stood next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president praised the billionaire's government work and called him \"one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.\"",
      "\"Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling,\" Mr. Trump said. Musk said he would continue to serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.",
      "Musk-Trump spat bursts wide open",
      "In the following days, Musk escalated his criticism of the legislation Mr. Trump has dubbed a \"big, beautiful bill,\" calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" in a lengthy early June tirade on his social media platform. The insults continued through the week, reaching a climax on June 5 with Mr. Trump threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him.",
      "Musk said he would shut down a SpaceX program that NASA relies on to transport astronauts \u2014 before later backtracking \u2014 and seemed to endorse an X post calling for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Musk also warned Republican lawmakers: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\"",
      "During the back-and-forth, Mr. Trump claimed that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with a provision in the budget bill that would end tax credits for electric vehicles.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:46:02 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the FDA \"to review the latest data on mifepristone\u200b,\" but experts say concerns about the abortion pill's safety are misguided.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data on mifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "More than 6 million women in the U.S. have used the brand name mifepristone, Mifeprex, since approval in 2000, the drug maker, Danco Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "\"Danco stands confidently behind the product's established safety and efficacy record,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, Gounder said it could come down to science versus politics.",
      "\"It really depends on if the FDA strictly follows the science and its own extensive safety reviews,\" she said on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday.",
      "This isn't the first time the drug has come under fire from abortion opponents and conservatives.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone.\"",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",
      "In 28 states, there are policies restricting access to mifepristone in some way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number to qualify for the Child Tax Credit, a policy shift that would make millions of kids ineligible.",
    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "Two Chinese researchers were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",

      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",

      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:05:16 -0400",
    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "At the American Museum of Natural History last fall, experts were hard at work preparing \"Encounters in the Milky Way,\" a deep dive into our home galaxy shaped by the movements of stars and other celestial objects.",
      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",
      "The show opens to the public on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

      "\"Shame the Belmont is not a mile-and-a-half,\" said Heart of Honor's trainer, Jamie Osborne, according to a news release after the Preakness. The brown colt didn't have the best start, but passed four horses to finish fifth in the 1 3/16-mile race, the shortest of the Triple Crown races.",
      "The Belmont is expected to return to Long Island's Belmont Park next year after the completion of a massive redevelopment project.",
      "While the Triple Crown has been won twice in the past decade \u2014 with American Pharoah ending a 37-year drought in 2015 and Justify in 2018 \u2014 winning just the Preakness and the Belmont has become more of a novelty. It was last accomplished in 2005 by Afleet Alex, who finished third in the Derby.",
      "At the Preakness, Journalism barreled down the stretch to overcome Gosger and win by half a length at Pimlico Race Course. The bay colt was the morning-line favorite for the Preakness as well as the Derby, winning over oddsmakers with four straight victories in California, including April's Santa Anita Derby, March's San Felipe Stakes and December's Los Alamitos Futurity Stakes.",
      "Jockey Umberto Rispoli, who was aboard Journalism for those three races, the Preakness and the Derby, had the mount again for the Belmont. Journalism's trainer, Michael McCarthy, has only had one other horse in the Belmont, Rombauer, who came in third in 2021.",
      "With 2-1 odds in the morning line, Sovereignty achieved a rarer feat than winning just the Preakness and the Belmont: victories at the Derby and the Belmont. The last horse to do that was Thunder Gulch in 1995 after finishing third at the Preakness.",
      "While Sovereignty  skipped the Triple Crown's middle jewel, the bay colt wasn't completely out of the news.

Alvarado is appealing the decision.",
      "Alvarado rode Sovereignty again on Saturday, which was the jockey's fourth mount in the Belmont. Last year, he was aboard Resilience, who finished in 10th place and was trained by Bill Mott. The two have teamed up again with Sovereignty. Mott has trained a Belmont winner before \u2014 Drosselmeyer, who won in 2010.",
      "Sovereignty came into the Belmont after finishing second at March's Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes in Florida and October's Street Sense Stakes at Churchill Downs, the home of the Derby.",
      "Baeza didn't initially draw a post for the Derby and only entered the field when Rodriguez was scratched from the race two days before the Run for the Roses. He broke from the post on the far outside and came in third behind Journalism by a neck. The horse came in third again at the Belmont.",
      "Before the Derby, the bay colt came in second at the Santa Anita Derby, also behind Journalism.",

      "Rodriguez was scratched from the Derby over what co-owner Tom Ryan described as a \"small but slightly sensitive foot bruise.\" Trainer Bob Baffert said the dark bay colt has healed and is performing as well as he was before he won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April at New York City's Aqueduct Racetrack, according to a New York Racing Association news release.",
      "Baffert has trained three Belmont winners: American Pharoah, Justify and Point Given, who won the race by 12 1/2 lengths in 2001. With 6-1 odds in the morning line, Rodriguez was under Mike Smith, who would have had his fourth Belmont win.",
      "Hill Road, who was given 10-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont, won the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct last month and finished third in the Tampa Bay Derby in March and in November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile in California.",
      "Irad Ortiz Jr. was aboard the bay colt in pursuit of his third Belmont win, most recently riding Mo Donegal to victory in 2022. Hill Road will be trainer Chad Brown's fifth career entry in the race. He's still seeking his first Belmont win after coming close with third-place Sierra Leone in 2024 and second-place Gronkowski in 2018.",
      "Crudo, who's co-owned by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, was given 15-1 odds in the morning line. The bay colt won the Sir Barton Stakes, one of the undercard races for the Preakness, and will be trainer Todd Pletcher's chance for a fifth Belmont win. John Velazquez had the mount as he went for his third victory at the race.",
      "Pletcher's second horse in the race, Uncaged, won at Saratoga in August and at Aqueduct in April but came in sixth at the Peter Pan. With 30-1 morning-line odds, the bay colt was under Luis Saez, who won the Belmont with Dornoch last year and with Essential Quality in 2021.",
      "With Heart of Honor, Saffie Osborne had another chance to become the first woman to ride to victory in a Triple Crown race since Julie Krone won the Belmont in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair. However, the horse dropped off early in the race.",

When asked by Welker if his relationship with him was over, the president said, \"I would assume so, yeah.\"",
      "\"I'm too busy doing other things,\" Trump continued. \"You know, I won an election in a landslide. I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration, and saved his life in my first administration, I have no intention of speaking to him.\"",
      "The president also issued a warning amid chatter that Musk could back Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\"If he does, he'll have to pay the consequences for that,\" Trump told NBC, though he declined to share what those consequences would be. Musk's businesses have many lucrative federal contracts.",
      "The relationship between Mr. Trump and Musk broke down publicly last week, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him.",
      "Musk, the world's richest person, had spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates, CBS News previously reported. He had posted several jabs against the president on X over the past week, including saying that Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Vance says Musk's attacks were a \"huge mistake\"",
      "Vance expressed his support for Mr. Trump, saying Musk was making a \"huge mistake\" going after Mr. Trump in a storm of bitter and inflammatory social media posts after a falling out between the two men.",
      "But the vice president, in an interview released Friday after the very public blow-up between the world's richest man and arguably the world's most powerful, also tried to downplay Musk's blistering attacks as an \"emotional guy\" who got frustrated.",
      "Musk attacked Mr. Trump in a torrent of social media posts, first criticizing the president's spending package and then targeting him with more direct attacks. Mr. Trump then portrayed Musk as disgruntled and \"CRAZY\" and threatened to cut the government contracts held by Musk's businesses. Trump ally Steve Bannon called for an investigation into Musk's immigration status and alleged drug use.",
      "During an interview with comedian Theo Von, Vance said he hopes that \"eventually Elon comes back into the fold,\" but said it might not be \"possible now because he's gone so nuclear.\" The interview was taped on Thursday as Musk's posts were unfurling on X, the social media network the billionaire owns.",
      "\"Look, it happens to everybody,\" Vance said in the interview. \"I've flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.\"",
      "The vice president told Von that as Musk for days was calling on social media for Congress to kill Mr. Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" the president was \"getting a little frustrated, feeling like some of the criticisms were unfair coming from Elon, but I think has been very restrained because the president doesn't think that he needs to be in a blood feud with Elon Musk.\"",
      "\"I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,\" he added.",
      "Vance's comments come as other Republicans in recent days have urged the two men to mend fences. Just weeks ago, Mr. Trump and Musk were close allies, spending significant time together while the billionaire served as a special advisor to the president and led the \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE.",
      "Vance called Musk an \"incredible entrepreneur,\" and said that DOGE, which sought to cut government spending and laid off or pushed out thousands of workers, was \"really good.\"",
      "Vance defends Trump against Epstein allegations",
      "Musk, who runs electric vehicle maker Tesla, internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX, also claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about the president's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "During the interview, Von showed the vice president Musk's claim that the Trump administration hasn't released all the records related to sex abuser Epstein because Mr. Trump is mentioned in them.",
      "Vance responded to that, saying, \"Absolutely not. Donald Trump didn't do anything wrong with Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's name has been found in court documents related to Epstein's case, but his appearance in the documents is not evidence of wrongdoing. CBS News\u00a0has previously covered\u00a0Mr. Trump's presence in those documents.",
      "In February, the Department of Justice gave a group of right-wing influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" but the influencers later said that there was little new information in the files. Attorney General Pam Bondi later shared the documents widely and said the first phase \"largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government.\" She said more documents would be forthcoming, but there have been no other releases since.",
      "Musk appeared by Saturday morning to have deleted his posts about Epstein.",
      "\"The president is doing a good job\"",
      "Musk also shared a post calling for Mr. Trump to be impeached and replaced with Vance. He also called for the formation of a new political party. The vice president said comments like those were \"just not helpful.\"",
      "\"It's totally insane. The president is doing a good job,\" Vance told Von.",
      "The vice president also defended the bill that has drawn Musk's ire, and said its central goal was not to cut spending but to extend the 2017 tax cuts approved in Trump's first term. The bill would slash spending but also leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance and spike deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Musk has warned that the bill will increase the federal deficit and called it a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"It's a good bill,\" Vance said. \"It's not a perfect bill.\"",
      "Vance also said it was ridiculous for some House Republicans who voted for the bill but later found parts objectionable to claim they hadn't had time to read it. The vice president said the text of the bill had been available for weeks.",
      "\"The idea that people haven't had an opportunity to actually read it is ridiculous,\" Vance said.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Jun 2025 14:39:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March, has been indicted and brought back to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who the Trump administration admitted was mistakenly deported back to his home country, has been returned to the U.S. to face two federal criminal counts that were detailed in an indictment unsealed on Friday.",
      "Filed in the federal district court in Nashville, the indictment charges Abrego Garcia with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. in March and flown to El Salvador, where he was initially held at a notorious supermax prison.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in remarks Friday at the Justice Department that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges after it was presented with an arrest warrant.",
      "\"Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice,\" Bondi said, adding: \"This is what American justice looks like.\"",
      "ABC News first reported Friday that he was being brought back to the U.S. to face the charges.",
      "In a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker on Saturday, President Trump seemed to distance himself from the decision to return the Maryland father to the U.S., saying \"that wasn't my decision.\"",
      "\"The Department of Justice decided to do it in that way, and that's fine,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that he felt confident that there is a \"very easy case\" against Abrego Garcia.",
      "A federal grand jury returned the indictment on May 21. The Justice Department said in a court filing that Abrego Garcia should be held in pretrial custody because \"he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight, and no condition or combination of conditions would ensure the safety of the community or his appearance in court.\"",
      "Bondi said the grand jury found that Abrego Garcia \"played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring\" that involved children and women and is \"a danger to our community.\" If Abrego Garcia is convicted, he would serve his sentence in the U.S. and then return to El Salvador, according to the attorney general.",
      "In her remarks, Bondi strayed beyond what was alleged in the indictment, claiming that Abrego Garcia played a role in the murder of a rival gang member's mother and solicited naked pictures from a minor. Neither of those allegations appear in the charging documents.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said in a statement that due process \"means the chance to defend yourself before you're punished, not after. This is an abuse of power, not justice.\" He said the government \"disappeared Kilmar to a foreign prison in violation of a court order. Now, after months of delay and secrecy, they're bringing him back, not to correct their error but to prosecute him.\"",
      "During a brief news conference Friday, Sandoval-Moshenberg added that Abrego Garcia is \"not going to be convicted of these crimes.\"",
      "\"There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\" he said.",
      "Abrego Garcia made an initial court appearance on Friday and remains in the custody of U.S. Marshals. His next hearing was scheduled for June 13.",
      "The indictment",
      "The filing alleges that between 2016 and 2025, Abrego Garcia and others conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S., passing through Mexico before crossing the southern border into Texas.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Abrego Garcia and an unidentified co-conspirator picked up the migrants in Houston and transported them to other parts of the U.S., and devised \"cover stories\" to give to law enforcement in the event they were stopped \u2014 like transporting people for construction work.",
      "The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia and six co-conspirators used cellphones and social media platforms to move migrants into and throughout the U.S. He allegedly worked with two of the co-conspirators to transport firearms that were purchased illegally in Texas for distribution and resale in Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived.",
      "Abrego Garcia and the six others also allegedly collected financial payments from migrants for their movements, according to the indictment. That money was then transferred between one another, the Justice Department said, claiming it was an effort to hide their origins.",
      "The indictment claims that Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators \"knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands\" of migrants who were not legally authorized to live or work in the U.S., and alleges that many of those people were members of the gang MS-13 and associates.",
      "The filing includes information about a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. The agency released body camera footage from the incident.",
      "Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped. He said that they had been performing construction work at a site in St. Louis, Missouri. An April report from the Department of Homeland Security about the incident said Aberego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime.",
      "What happened in Friday's hearing",
      "Abrego Garcia was escorted into the Nashville courtroom Friday by two Homeland Security Investigations agents. Both sat at opposite ends of him during the hearing.",
      "Abrego Garcia, in a white-colored, short-sleeved button-down shirt and jeans, appeared confused and tired during the hearing, and mostly kept his head down while waiting for Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to enter the courtroom.",
      "He remained mostly stoic for the full length of the hearing, making no notable facial expressions or showing any strong emotion.",
      "His attorney, a public defender, noted that he had little time to speak with his client beforehand, and said he had only received a copy of the indictment in English. The attorney said he had been working to have the entire indictment read to Abrego Garcia in Spanish, but \"only made it halfway\" through before Abrego Garcia was escorted into the courtroom.",
      "The judge said she intends to set a detention hearing for next week. Abrego Garcia's attorney argued he should be released from custody, saying the Justice Department did not prove the defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the community.",
      "Following a lengthy recess and discussion, Holmes decided Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals until his next hearing on June 13 at 11 a.m. ET.",
      "Holmes said that hearing will serve to determine if prosecutors have the basis to request a detention hearing in the first place, and if so, that hearing will also serve as a detention hearing and his arraignment.",
      "Abrego Garcia's deportation",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked nationwide backlash after an immigration official in the Trump administration acknowledged that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" The 29-year-old had been granted a legal status in 2019, known as withholding of removal, that forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among the more than 200 people who were boarded onto planes bound for El Salvador in mid-March for confinement in the country's notorious maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. The removals were part of the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, which have prompted numerous legal battles across the country.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who had lived in Maryland since he came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011, was initially held at CECOT but eventually moved to a lower-security facility, according to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador in April. The State Department later confirmed he had been transferred.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's attorney, said Friday that Abrego Garcia \"is one of the first, if not the first person\" to leave CECOT and he was curious to hear about his treatment there.",
      "\"So it's going to be very interesting to hear what he has to say about the way in which he was treated in that prison by the Salvadoran authorities, especially his first days in that prison before the Salvadoran government realized that he was special in the object of attention in the United States,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "Van Hollen on Friday said that the Trump administration has for months been flouting the Supreme Court and the Constitution.",
      "\"Today, they appear to have finally relented to our demands for compliance with court orders and with the due process rights afforded to everyone in the United States,\" he said in a statement. \"As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it's about his constitutional rights \u2014 and the rights of all. The administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case, and U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis' orders for the government to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. was the catalyst for an escalating clash between the Trump administration and the courts that has played out over the past few weeks. The government was accused of defying Xinis' demand that it facilitate his release from Salvadoran custody \u2014 which was affirmed by the Supreme Court \u2014 and refusing to provide any details about what efforts it had taken to do so.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing an allegation from a confidential informant and the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested in 2019, after which he was released from custody. His lawyers have denied that Abrego Garcia has any ties to MS-13, and said he has never been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "Legal battle goes to Supreme Court",
      "Three courts \u2014 the district court on which Xinis sits, a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court \u2014 all said the Trump administration had to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody. The Supreme Court also directed the government to ensure that his case \"is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "But lawyers for Abrego Garcia said the administration has defied those decisions by repeatedly refusing to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. or provide any information about whether it has even made attempts to do so.",
      "In response, Xinis ordered an expedited examination into the Trump administration's refusal to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and allowed his lawyers to pose 15 questions to government officials and make 15 requests for documents.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers told Xinis that the Trump administration turned over \"nothing of substance\" and provided \"non-responsive\" answers to their questions. The judge then blasted the administration for its responses and blamed it for \"continued mischaracterization\" of the Supreme Court's order. She said their objection to certain requests for information \"reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Regarding the administration's attempts to invoke certain privileges to shield certain details from Abrego Garcia's lawyers, the judge said they rely on \"boilerplate assertions.\"",
      "\"That ends now,\" Xinis wrote.",

      "Simone Biles took aim at former U.S. NCAA swimmer turned conservative pundit Riley Gaines on Friday over the latter's recent comments advocating for the exclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Gaines was among more than a dozen college athletes who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in March 2024, accusing it of violating their Title IX rights by allowing transgender swimmer Lia Thomas to compete at the national championships in 2022. In that championship, Thomas and Gaines tied for fifth but only Thomas was handed the fifth-place trophy in the 200-yard final. Since then, Gaines has become an activist staunchly opposed to having transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Recently, Gaines' commentary has also included spotlighting and, in some cases, vilifying transgender youth for their involvement in women's and girls' sports. On Friday, she targeted the Minnesota State High School League for not allowing comments on their post about the Chaplin Park girls' team celebrating the state championships. Chaplin Park's team includes a trans-athlete.",
      "\"Comments off lol,\" Gaines\u00a0commented\u00a0in a post on X. \"To be expected when your star player is a boy.\"",
      "Biles, an outspoken campaigner for mental health awareness throughout her career, quickly criticized Gaines' comments on social media.",
      "\"You're truly sick, all of this campaigning because you lost a race,\" Biles said, referencing Gaines' fifth-place finish.",
      "\"Straight up sore loser. You should be uplifting the trans community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive or creating a new avenue where trans feel safe in sports,\" Biles continued. \"Instead...you bully them. One things for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around!\"",
      "She added: \"Bully someone your own size, which would ironically be a male.\"",

      "Grant Hardin escaped on May 25 from the Calico Rock prison by donning an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform, officials have said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge signed off on arguably the biggest change in the history of college sports on Friday, clearing the way for schools to begin paying their athletes millions of dollars as soon as next month as the multibillion-dollar industry shreds the last vestiges of the amateur model that defined it for more than a century.",
      "Nearly five years after Arizona State swimmer Grant House sued the NCAA and its five biggest conferences to lift restrictions on revenue sharing, U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken approved the final proposal that had been hung up on roster limits, just one of many changes ahead amid concerns that thousands of walk-on athletes will lose their chance to play college sports.",
      "The sweeping terms of the so-called House settlement include approval for each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion that will be paid over the next decade to thousands of former players who were barred from that revenue for years.",
      "In a letter penned by NCAA President Charlie Baker following the announcement, Baker wrote that the settlement \"opens a pathway to begin stabilizing college sports. This new framework that enables schools to provide direct financial benefits to student-athletes and establishes clear and specific rules to regulate third-party NIL [name, image and likeness] agreements marks a huge step forward for college sports.\"",
      "The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming.",
      "The scope of the changes \u2014 some have already begun \u2014 is difficult to overstate. The professionalization of college athletics will be seen in the high-stakes and expensive recruitment of stars on their way to the NFL and NBA, and they will be felt by athletes whose schools have decided to pare their programs. The agreement will resonate in nearly every one of the NCAA's 1,100 member schools boasting nearly 500,000 athletes.",
      "Wilken's ruling comes 11 years after she dealt the first significant blow to the NCAA ideal of amateurism when she ruled in favor of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon and others who were seeking a way to earn money from the use of their name, image and likeness, or NIL \u2014 a term that is now as common in college sports as \"March Madness\" or \"Roll Tide.\" It was just four years ago that the NCAA cleared the way for NIL money to start flowing, but the changes coming are even bigger.",
      "Wilken granted preliminary approval to the settlement last October. That sent colleges scurrying to determine not only how they were going to afford the payments, but how to regulate an industry that also allows players to cut deals with third parties so long as they are deemed compliant by a newly formed enforcement group that will be run by auditors at Deloitte.",
      "The agreement takes a big chunk of oversight away from the NCAA and puts it in the hands of the four biggest conferences. The ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC hold most of the power and decision-making heft, especially when it comes to the College Football Playoff, which is the most significant financial driver in the industry and is not under the NCAA umbrella like the March Madness tournaments are.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the FDA \"to review the latest data on mifepristone\u200b,\" but experts say concerns about the abortion pill's safety are misguided.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data on mifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "More than 6 million women in the U.S. have used the brand name mifepristone, Mifeprex, since approval in 2000, the drug maker, Danco Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "\"Danco stands confidently behind the product's established safety and efficacy record,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, Gounder said it could come down to science versus politics.",
      "\"It really depends on if the FDA strictly follows the science and its own extensive safety reviews,\" she said on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday.",
      "This isn't the first time the drug has come under fire from abortion opponents and conservatives.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone.\"",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",
      "In 28 states, there are policies restricting access to mifepristone in some way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",

    "summary": "Roughly a quarter of consumers use \"buy now, pay later\" loans for ordinary expenses like groceries. That's worrisome, a personal finance expert says.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of consumers are taking out \"buy now, pay later,\" or BNPL, loans to cover everyday living expenses, data shows, a sign of the precarious financial state facing many U.S. households.",
      "A quarter of Americans now use BNPL loans to pay for groceries, up 14% from last year, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. The personal finance firm also found that more people are using such financing to pay for clothing, technology and housewares.",
      "BNPL loans \u2014 which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple \u2014 let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The most common BNPL loans are \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks.",
      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",
      "\"That speaks to how easy these are to get and how easy it is to overspend on them,\" Schulz said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill requires both parents to have a Social Security number to qualify for the Child Tax Credit, a policy shift that would make millions of kids ineligible.",
    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

      "\"We were trying to put it out ourselves with our buckets, together with our neighbors. Then the rescuers arrived and started helping us put out the fire, but there was smoke and they worried that we couldn't stay there. When the ceiling started falling off, they took us out,\" she said.",
      "Local resident Vadym Ihnachenko said that he thought at first that it was a neighboring building going up in flames.",
      "\"But when we saw sparks coming from the top, we realized it was our building,\" he said.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that Russia struck with 215 missiles and drones overnight, and Ukrainian air defenses shot down 87 drones and seven missiles.",
      "Several other areas in Ukraine were also hit, including the regions of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, and the city of Ternopil, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in an X post.",
      "\"To put an end to Russia's killing and destruction, more pressure on Moscow is required, as are more steps to strengthen Ukraine,\" he said.",

      "Trump also said that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia \"fight for a while\" before pulling them apart and pursuing peace. Trump's comments were a remarkable detour from his often-stated appeals to stop the war and signaled that he may be giving up on recent peace efforts.",
      "Later on Saturday, Russia and Ukraine each accused the other of endangering plans to swap 6,000 bodies of soldiers killed in action, agreed upon during direct talks in Istanbul on Monday that otherwise made no progress towards ending the war.",
      "Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide who led the Russian delegation, said that Kyiv called a last-minute halt to an imminent swap.

    "story": [
      "The Russia-backed Wagner Group said Friday it is leaving Mali after more than three and a half years of fighting Islamic extremists and insurgents in the country.",
      "Despite Wagner's announcement, Russia will continue to have a mercenary presence in the West African country. The Africa Corps, Russia's state-controlled paramilitary force, said on its Telegram channel Friday that Wagner's departure would not introduce any changes and the Russian contingent will remain in Mali.",
      "Wagner is a group of entities that operate as a private military company, or PMC. These PMCs can be hired by governments for security or combat services.",
      "\"Mission accomplished. Private Military Company Wagner returns home,\" the group announced via its channel on the messaging app Telegram. It said it had brought all regional capitals under control of the Malian army, pushed out armed militants and killed their commanders.",
      "Mali, along with neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for more than a decade battled an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.",
      "As Western influence in the region has waned, Russia has sought to step into the vacuum, sweeping in with offers of assistance. Moscow initially expanded its military cooperation with African nations by using the Wagner Group of mercenaries. But since the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash in 2023, after mounting a brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has been developing the Africa Corps as a rival force to Wagner.",
      "Africa Corps is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry.",
      "According to U.S. officials, there are around 2,000 mercenaries in Mali. It is unclear how many are with Wagner and how many are part of the Africa Corps.",
      "Beverly Ochieng, a security analyst specializing in the Sahel for Control Risks consultancy, said the Russian defense ministry had been negotiating with Mali to take on more Africa Corps fighters and for Wagner mercenaries to join Russia's state-controlled paramilitary force.",
      "\"Since the death of Prigozhin, Russia has had this whole plan to then make the Wagner Group fall under the command of the Ministry of Defense. One of the steps they made was to revamp or introduce the Africa Corps, which is the way in which the Russian paramilitaries would retain a presence in areas where the Wagner group has been operating,\" Ochieng said.",
      "Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. But the Malian army and Russian mercenaries struggled to curb violence in the country and have both been accused of targeting civilians.",
      "Last month, United Nations experts urged Malian authorities to investigate reports of alleged summary executions and forced disappearances by Wagner mercenaries and the army.",
      "In December, Human Rights Watch accused Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group of deliberately killing at least 32 civilians over an 8-month span.",
      "The announcement of Wagner's withdrawal comes as the Malian army and the Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses during attacks by the al-Qaida linked group JNIM in recent weeks.",
      "Last week, JNIM fighters killed dozens of soldiers in an attack on a military base in central Mali.",
      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the major losses might have caused the possible end of Wagner's mission.",
      "\"The lack of an official and mutual announcement from both the Malian authorities and Wagner indicate possible internal dispute which led to this sudden decision. Simultaneously, this could point to a new framework for Russian presence in the country,\" he said.",
      "Replacing Wagner with Africa Corps troops would likely shift Russia's focus in Mali from fighting alongside the Malian army to training, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.",
      "\"Africa Corps has a lighter footprint and focuses more on training, providing equipment and doing protection services. They fight less than the 'Rambo-type' Wagner mercenaries,\" Laessing said.",

They are still holding 55 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.

      "\"Without Social Security, 22 million people would be pushed into poverty. That includes over 16 million seniors and nearly 1 million children. And in fact, Elon Musk has also said and agreed with you, sir, that this is a Ponzi scheme. I think it's ironic that you are one of our witnesses talking about efficiency when you want to attack the single best program that we have to support people not just out of poverty, but across this country to uplift them, to ensure they can afford a decent life.\"",

      "\"Rep Garcia does not know the definition of Ponzi scheme,\" Turner said. \"Social Security is the ultimate Ponzi, demanding more and more people at the bottom pay in to fund the people at the top, expect our demographics have this now reversed. The system will default. Mr. Garcia nor I will likely never see a dime. That should worry him more than my social media feed.\"",
      "Turner told Fox News Digital that if Garcia\u2019s staff were to spend as much time trying to save Social Security as it did \"combing through my social media\" then \"perhaps the Ponzi scheme can survive long enough for me to get a small percentage of what the government confiscated during my lifetime.\"",
      "Turner explained that his father had received a \"paltry percentage\" of what he paid into the program and the the government \"kept the rest\" when his father died.",
      "\"That\u2019s not just a Ponzi scheme, it\u2019s government greed and politicians running a money-laundering operation to get reelected. No one should be compelled to pay into a failed system, yet in a free America, you don\u2019t have that choice.\"",
      "In addition to Turner and Elon Musk suggesting that Social Security is by definition set up like a Ponzi scheme, Fox News Digital\u00a0previously spoke to\u00a0James Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute Just Facts, who said the characterization has \"validity.\"",
      "'FAILURE'S NOT AN OPTION': TRUMP BUDGET BILL WILL BE 'BIG' HELP FOR SENIORS, TOP HOUSE TAX-WRITER SAYS",
      "\"A Ponzi scheme operates by taking money from new investors to pay current investors,\" Agresti said. \"That's the definition given by the SEC, and contrary to popular belief, that's exactly how Social Security operates.\"",
      "Agresti explained to Fox News Digital that Social Security, a program mired for decades with concerns about waste, fraud, and improper payments, \"doesn't take our money and save it for us, as many people believe, and then give it to us when we're older\" like many Americans might believe.",
      "\"What it does is, it transfers money when we are young and working and paying into Social Security taxes,\" Agresti said. \"That money, the vast bulk of it, goes immediately out the door to people who are currently receiving benefits. Now, there is a trust fund, but in 90 years of operation, that trust fund currently has enough money to fund two years of program operations.\"",
      "The trust fund only being able to last for two years is not a result of the fund being \"looted,\" Agresti explained, but rather it was put in place to \"put surpluses in it\" from money that Social Security collects in taxes that it doesn't pay out immediately and pays interest on.",
      "\"The interest that's been paid on that has been higher than the rate of inflation,\" Agresti said. \"So, the problem isn't that the trust fund has been looted. The problem is that Social Security operates like a Ponzi scheme.\"",
      "Democrats have vocally pushed back against efforts by Republicans and DOGE to reform Social Security or make cuts to what they say are examples of wasteful or improper spending from the department.",
      "\"There's been a lot of misinformation about that as of late,\" Agresti told Fox News Digital. \"You know, when DOGE came in and suggested that the Social Security Administration cut, I think it was about 10,000 workers, Democrats erupted that this is going to weaken Social Security. But the fact of the matter is that Social Security pays those workers who are for administrative overhead from the Social Security trust fund. So, by cutting out the money that they're paying them, you actually strengthen the program financially.\"",

      "\"Every single study shows social security going completely bankrupt in the next few years. Garcia and other democrats know the iceberg is ahead but rather than turn the ship, they are yelling at the iceberg about the senior citizens onboard,\" Turner said. \"This Ponzi scheme is collapsing fast, and turning my tweets into posters is not going to stop it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports the latest as Congress moves to codify billions in DOGE cuts recommended by Elon Musk.",
      "Some of the White House\u2019s conservative House allies say they\u2019re interpreting the upcoming vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s $9.4 billion spending cut proposal as a \"test\" of what Congress can achieve in terms of rolling back federal funding.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he would not speak for members of the Trump administration but added, \"I do think it is a test.\"",
      "\"And I think this is going to demonstrate whether Congress has the fortitude to do what they always say they\u2019ll do,\" Roy said. \"Cut the minimal amount of spending \u2013 $9 billion, NPR, PBS, things you complain about for a long time, or are they going to go back into their parochial politics?\"",
      "House GOP leaders unveiled legislation seeking to codify Trump\u2019s spending cut request, known as a rescissions package, on Friday. It\u2019s expected to get a House-wide vote sometime next week.",

      "President Donald Trump has formally asked Congress to cut $9.4 billion in funds to PBS, NPR and USAID. (Getty Images/AP Images)",
      "\"The\u00a0rescissions\u00a0request sent to Congress by the Trump Administration takes the federal government in a new direction where we actually cut waste, fraud, and abuse and hold agencies accountable to the American people,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement introducing the bill.",
      "The legislation would claw back funding that Congress already appropriated to PBS, NPR, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) \u2013 cuts outlined by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year.",
      "And while several Republican leaders and officials have already said they expect to see more rescissions requests down the line, some people who spoke with Fox News Digital believe the White House is watching how Congress handles this first package before deciding on next steps.",
      "\"You\u2019re dead right,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital when asked if the rescissions package was a test. \"I think that it\u2019s a test case \u2013 if we can\u2019t get that\u2026then we\u2019re not serious about cutting the budget.\"",
      "A rescissions package only needs simple majorities in the House and Senate to pass. But Republicans in both chambers have perilously slim majorities that afford them few defections.",
      "Republicans are also racing the clock \u2013 a rescissions package has 45 days to be considered otherwise it is considered rejected and the funding reinstated.",
      "MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET \u2018BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL\u2019 WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE",

      "Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, did not directly say whether he viewed the spending cuts as a test but dismissed any potential concerns.",
      "\"This is very low-hanging fruit, and I don\u2019t anticipate any problems,\" Gooden told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"I\u2019ve heard a few comments in the media, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re serious comments. If someone on the Republican side can make a case for PBS, but they won\u2019t take a tough vote against illegal immigration, then we\u2019ve got a lot of problems.\"",
      "Paul Winfree, president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), told Fox News Digital last week, \"This first rescissions package from President Trump is a test as to whether Congress has the ability to deliver on his mandate by canceling wasteful spending through a filibuster-proof process.\"",
      "\"If they can\u2019t then it\u2019s a signal for the president to turn up the dial with other tools at his disposal,\" Winfree, who served as Director of Budget Policy in the first Trump administration, said.",
      "Both Roy and Norman suggested a process known as \"pocket rescissions\" could be at least one backup plan \u2013 and one that Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has floated himself.",
      "\"Pocket rescissions\" essentially would mean the White House introduces its spending cut proposal less than 45 days before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. In theory, it would run out the clock on those funds and allow them to expire whether Congress acted or not.",
      "Vought told reporters after meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday that he wanted to \"see if it passes\" but was \"open\" to further rescissions packages.",
      "\"We want to send up general\u00a0rescissions\u00a0bills, to use the process if it's appropriate, to get them through the House and the Senate,\" Vought said. \"We also have\u00a0pocket\u00a0rescissions, which you\u2019ve begun to hear me talk a lot about, to be able to use the end of the fiscal year to send up a similar\u00a0rescissions, and have the funds expire. So there's a lot of things that we're looking at.\"",
      "Still, some moderate Republicans may chafe at the conservative spending cuts.",

      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., refused to comment on whether he\u2019d support the legislation before seeing the details but alluded to some concerns.",

      "The legislation is expected to come before the House Rules Committee, the final gatekeeper before most legislation sees a House-wide vote, on Tuesday afternoon.",

      "Though the uncertainty yielded by Trump's fight against Harvard could prove damaging to the school's priority of maintaining a diverse international student body, or by offering financial aid to students via the federally operated Pell Grant, these actions alone would unlikely to prove financially devastating in the near-term, experts told Fox News.",
      "Harvard could simply opt to fill the slots once taken by international students with any number of eager, well-qualified U.S.-based applicants, David Feldman, a professor at William & Mary who focuses on economic issues and higher education, said in an interview.",

      "\"This is all about Harvard, choosing the best group of students possible,\" Feldman said in an interview. If the administration successfully revokes their SEVP certification, this would effectively just be \"constraining them to choose the second-best group,\" he said.",
      "\"Harvard could dump the entire 1,500-person entering class, just dump it completely, and look at the next 1,500 [applicants],\" Feldman said. \"And by all measurables that you and I would look at, it would look just as good.\"",
      "Unlike public schools, which are subject to the vagaries of state budgets, private universities like Harvard often have margins built into their budgets in the form of seed money that allows them to allocate more money towards things they've identified as goals for the year or years ahead.",
      "This allows them to operate with more stability as a result \u2014 and inoculates them to a larger degree from the administration's financial hits.",

      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

    "summary": "E-BAR, MIT&apos;s mobile robot, provides physical support for seniors with handlebars that follow from behind, helping prevent falls while maintaining dignity for aging adults.",
    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "An individual demonstrating the E-BAR. (MIT)",
      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices.

While most people worry about social media leaks or email hacks, a far less visible threat comes from data brokers.",

What baffles me even more is that they aren\u2019t serious about protecting the one thing that is central to their business model: data.",
      "Just last year, we saw news of a massive data breach at a data broker called National Public Data, which\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. And now another data broker, LexisNexis, a major name in the industry, has reported a significant breach that exposed sensitive information from more than 364,000 people.",

      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",
      "The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.",

      "Why the LexisNexis hack is a bigger threat than you realize",
      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.",

      "7 expert tips to protect your personal data after a data broker breach",
      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",

      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

      "A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "The story of\u00a0AirCar begins in Slovakia, where designer \u0160tefan Klein and his team have been working on flying cars since the late 1980s. After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year. Customer deliveries are planned for early 2026, and the company even has plans for an amphibious version that could land on water.",

      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot.",

      "THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES",
      "What licenses do you need to drive and fly the AirCar?",
      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it.

      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does it compare to other flying cars?",
      "Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production.

      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "A woman shopping online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities.

      "10 proactive measures to take to protect your data",
      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked.

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a viral video that shows a humanoid robot going wild. A tech nightmare or just a glitch?",
      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.",
      "The scene has sparked heated debate about the safety of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. But is this truly the beginning of something out of our worst fears, or is there just a straightforward technical explanation for what happened?",

      "Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing its arms and legs (Reddit) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What the video shows",
      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The robot behind the incident",
      "The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "CHINESE HUMANOID ROBOT WITH EAGLE EYE VISION AND POWERFUL AI",
      "What went wrong?",
      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike.

      "In most cases, 401(k) fees, which can include administrative service costs and fees for investment management, are relatively low, depending on the plan provider.",
      "But there could be additional fees on 401(k) accounts left behind from previous jobs that come with an extra bite.",
      "Fees on forgotten 401(k)s",
      "Former employees who don\u2019t take their 401(k) with them could be charged an additional fee to maintain those accounts, according to Romi Savova, CEO of PensionBee, an online retirement provider. \u201cIf you leave it with the employer, the employer could force the record keeping costs on to you,\u201d she said.",
      "According to PensionBee\u2019s analysis, a $4.55 monthly nonemployee maintenance fee on top of other costs can add up to nearly $18,000 in lost retirement funds over time. Not only does the monthly fee eat into the principal, but workers also lose the compound growth that would have accumulated on the balance, the study found.",
      "Fees on those forgotten 401(k)s can be particularly devastating for long-term savers, said Gil Baumgarten, founder and CEO of Segment Wealth Management in Houston.",
      "That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it pays to move your balance, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are two sides to every story,\u201d he said. \u201cLost 401(k)s can be problematic, but rolling into a IRA could come with other costs.\u201d",
      "What to do with your old 401(k)",
      "When workers switch jobs, they may be able to move the funds to a new employer-sponsored plan or roll their old 401(k) funds into an individual retirement account, which many people do.",
      "But IRAs typically have higher investment fees than 401(k)s and those rollovers can also cost workers thousands of dollars over decades, according to another study, by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonprofit research organization.",
      "Collectively, workers who roll money into IRAs could pay $45.5 billion in extra fees over a hypothetical retirement period of 25 years, Pew estimated.",
      "Another option is to cash out an old 401(k), which is generally considered the least desirable option because of the hefty tax penalty. Even so, Vanguard found 33% of workers do that.",
      "How to find a forgotten 401(k)",
      "While leaving your retirement savings in your former employer\u2019s plan is often the simplest option, the risk of losing track of an old plan has been growing.",
      "Now, 25% of all 401(k) plan assets are left behind or forgotten, according to the most recent data from Capitalize, up from 20% two years prior.",
      "However, thanks to \u201cSecure 2.0,\u201d a slew of measures affecting retirement savers, the Department of Labor created the retirement savings lost and found database to help workers find old retirement plans.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it can\u2019t really be lost,\u201d Baumgarten said. \u201cEvery one of these companies has a responsibility to provide statements.\u201d Often simply updating your contact information can help reconnect you with these records, he advised.",
      "You can also use your Social Security number to track down funds through the National Registry of Unclaimed Retirement Benefits, a private-sector database.",
      "In 2022, a group of large 401(k) plan administrators launched the Portability Services Network.",
      "That consortium works with defined contributor plan rollover specialist Retirement Clearinghouse on auto portability, or the automatic transfer of small-balance 401(k)s. Depending on the plan, employees with up to $7,000 could have their savings automatically transferred into a workplace retirement account with their new employer when they change jobs.",
      "The goal is to consolidate and maintain those retirement savings accounts, rather than cashing them out or risk losing track of them, during employment transitions, according to Mike Shamrell, vice president of thought leadership at Fidelity Investments, the nation\u2019s largest provider of 401(k) plans and a member of the Portability Services Network."

      "SEATTLE \u2014 Authorities have closed a wide swath of popular campgrounds and backpacking areas along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington as they search for a former Army soldier wanted in the deaths of his three young daughters.",
      "Dozens of additional law enforcement officers from an array of agencies joined the investigation and search Friday for Travis Caleb Decker, 32, four days after the girls \u2014 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker \u2014 were found dead at a remote campsite outside Leavenworth.",
      "The girls' mother reported them missing the night of May 30 when Decker failed to return them to her home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, after a scheduled visit.",
      "Gov. Bob Ferguson announced Friday night that he was ordering the state's National Guard to help with the search, saying \"we will be providing helicopter transportation for law enforcement as they search in remote areas.\"",
      "\"The brutal murder of these young children has shocked our state,\" he added in a statement on social media. \"I'm committed to supporting law enforcement as they seek justice for Paityn, Evelyn and Olivia.\"",
      "The Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that there were more than 100 officers involved in the search, which covered rugged terrain in the Cascade Mountains of central Washington, and more than 500 tips had poured in from the public.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have been given notice to, and are working in conjunction with our surrounding counties in the event Mr. Decker moves through the forest into their jurisdiction,\" the statement said.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014, according to Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro. From 2014 to 2016, he was an automatic rifleman with the 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.",
      "Last September his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with the girls until he found housing.",
      "\"He has made huge sacrifices to serve our country and loves his girls very much but he has got to get better,\" she wrote. \"I do not want to keep Travis from the girls at all. ... But I cannot have our girls staying in what is essentially a homeless shelter, at times unsupervised, with dozens of strange men, or staying in a tent or living in his truck with him both in extreme temperatures and unknown areas for their safety.\"",
      "Authorities warned people to be on the lookout for Decker and asked those with remote homes, cabins or outbuildings to keep them locked, to leave blinds open so law enforcement can see inside and to leave exterior lights on.",
      "It was unclear if Decker was armed, but the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said he should be considered dangerous. A reward of up to $20,000 was offered for information leading to his arrest.",
      "An online fundraiser for Whitney Decker raised more than $1 million, and friends Amy Edwards, who taught the girls in a theater program called \"Short Shakespeareans,\" and Mark Belton thanked supporters during a news conference Thursday.",
      "\"Their laughter, curiosity and spirit left a mark on all of us,\" Edwards said. \"They were the kind of children that everyone rooted for, looked forward to seeing and held close in their hearts.\"",
      "Edwards and Belton said Whitney Decker hopes the tragedy prompts changes to the state's Amber Alert system as well as improvements in mental health care for veterans. The night the girls were reported missing, Wenatchee police asked the Washington State Patrol to issue an Amber Alert but it declined, saying that as a custody matter without an imminent threat, the case did not meet the criteria for one.",
      "The patrol did issue an \"endangered missing person alert\" the next day, but those do not result in notifications being sent to mobile phones.",
      "As searches expanded for the girls last weekend, a sheriff's deputy found Decker's pickup in the area of Rock Island Campground, northwest of Leavenworth. There were two bloody handprints on the tailgate. The girls' bodies were discovered down an embankment nearby with evidence that they had been bound with zip ties, according to an affidavit filed in support of murder and kidnapping charges against Decker.",

      "The second-ranked Gauff came out on top of a contest that was full of tension and momentum swings to claim her second major trophy after the 2023 U.S. Open, where she also came from a set down to beat Sabalenka in the final.",
      "Gauff raised the winners\u2019 trophy aloft, then kissed it several times. She held her hand over her heart when the U.S. national anthem played.",
      "It was the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 final in Paris since 2013, when Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, and just the second in the last 30 years.",
      "After Sabalenka sent a backhand wide on Gauff\u2019s second match point, the 21-year-old American fell onto her back, covering her face with both hands as she started to sob, then got up and held her hand over her mouth. She continued to sob as she patted the clay with her left hand.",
      "After greeting Sabalenka at the net with a warm hug and thanking the umpire, Gauff screamed out with joy and relief, then got to her knees and crouched forward, continuing to cry as she savored the win.",
      "She hugged later film director Spike Lee and celebrated with her entourage in her box, three years after she lost in her first Grand Slam final at Roland-Garros.",
      "In her on-court speech, she said that defeat in 2022 at the age of 18 put her in a \u201cdark place\u201d and then thanked the fans on Court-Philippe Chatrier, who were rooting mostly for her.",
      "\u201cThe crowd really helped me today, you guys were cheering for me so hard and I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve so much love from the French crowd,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I appreciate you, guys.\u201d",
      "Sabalenka was in tears moments earlier when she made her speech. Struggling to find her words, she praised Gauff for being a \u201cfighter\u201d and said she deserved the win, but added that the windy conditions made for an error-strewn contest.",
      "\u201cThis will hurt so much. Coco, congrats, in the tough conditions you were a better player than me,\u201d she said. \u201cWell done, great two weeks, and congrats on the second Grand Slam, it\u2019s well deserved.\u201d",
      "Sabalenka started the deciding set strongly, sticking to her high-risk approach to hold her first service game.",
      "Gauff responded by raising her level, winning a superb rally in the third game that drew loud cheers. After an intense exchange of drop shots, Gauff hit a lob that Sabalenka chased down before attempting a shot between her legs \u2014 only for Gauff to intercept it at the net and finish with a winner.",
      "Gauff was consistent from the baseline and earned a break point which she converted when Sabalenka double-faulted, giving her a 2-1 lead. Sabalenka turned toward her box and shouted in frustration but then regained her composure, breaking back to level the match at 3-3.",
      "She was broken again at love, however, and Gauff then held serve twice to claimed the title after a match that lasted 2 hours, 38 minutes.",
      "Gauff now owns two French Open trophies after winning last year\u2019s women\u2019s doubles title."

      "People connected Escobar's departure to backlash she was receiving for using racist language on podcasts. The controversial clips resurfaced on social media after Escobar was announced as a Season 7 cast member.",
      "In her Instagram post, Escobar said she wanted to \"apologize for using a word I had no right in using.\"",
      "\"Podcast clips from years ago have recently resurfaced, and I want to address it directly,\" she wrote. \"In those clips, I used a word I never should\u2019ve used, a racial slur. I used it ignorantly, not fully understanding the weight, history, or pain behind it. I wasn\u2019t trying to be offensive or harmful, but I recognize now that intention doesn\u2019t excuse impact. And the impact of that word is real. It\u2019s tied to generations of trauma, and it is not mine to use.\"",
      "Escobar explained that she used the racial slur when she was \"speaking casually in conversation\" and she didn't think \"deeply or critically about what I was saying.\"",
      "\"But that doesn\u2019t take away from how wrong it was. The truth is, I didn\u2019t know better then, but I do now,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve taken the time to reflect, to learn, and to grow from that moment.\"",
      "Escobar went on to say that she's \"changed a lot\" since she's done those podcasts. She noted that she shows up for others differently and also speaks differently as well.",
      "\"Growth means recognizing when you were wrong, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable, and choosing to move forward with humility and accountability,\" she said.",
      "The 27-year-old then ended her statement by saying she takes \"full ownership of my actions\" and she apologized again to anyone who was \"disappointed or offended\" by her words.",
      "Online, she shared her statement alongside a personal quote from herself, which said, \"Owning my mistakes speaking my truth.\"",
      "Escobar was introduced as a cast member for Season 7 of \"Love Island USA\" in May.",
      "In a teaser video that Peacock shared on YouTube, Escobar said she was excited to be on the show after her previous \"nine year relationship\" ended in heartbreak.",
      "\u201cI want my man to nurture me,\" she said.",
      "On the premiere episode of the series, Escobar coupled up with Ace Green. As they were exploring their love connection, series narrator Iain Stirling informed viewers that Escobar would no longer be on the program in an announcement he made on the second episode.",
      "\u201cWelcome back to \u2018Love Island USA,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYulissa has left the villa.\u201d However, it is unclear when Escobar left Fiji, where the show is filmed, and if she was edited out of episodes."

      "After being acquitted of murder charges, Georgia Miller is ready for a fresh start in the Season 3 finale of \"Ginny & Georgia.\" But it appears that fate isn't quite done tossing curveballs at the Mayoress Murderess just yet.",
      "In an ironic twist of fate, Georgia (Brianne Howey) leaves her daughter Ginny (Antonia Gentry) and viewers alike wondering if she's pregnant in the very last scene of the action-packed finale. Then there's the lingering question of who the father could be.",
      "It's a wild plot twist, especially given the fact that Georgia just faked a pregnancy earlier in the season.",
      "As viewers eagerly await Season 4 of the Netflix series (yes, it's already been renewed!), we're diving into the shocking cliffhanger that has fans buzzing.",
      "Why Georgia's fake pregnancy is key to this plot twist",
      "To understand the irony behind this pregnancy mystery, let's take a step back and recall how Georgia ended up faking a pregnancy during Season 3 to convince her husband Paul (Scott Porter) to show up to court for her.",
      "Throughout the season, Georgia was on trial for allegedly murdering Cynthia Fuller's husband Tom Fuller, who was in hospice care at home. Georgia was indeed guilty, but thought of it as a mercy killing since Tom was suffering and Cynthia and her son were miserable watching him slip away.",
      "As more dirt from Georgia's past (which includes multiple murders) comes to light during the trial, Paul loses faith in his wife and moves out.",
      "When Georgia's daughter Ginny gets pregnant and subsequently gets an abortion, Georgia devises a plan to make Paul stick around and support her in court. After all, his status as the town's mayor is a great feather in her cap and his presence in court could help sway public opinion.",
      "To put her plan in motion, Georgia shows Paul Ginny's positive pregnancy test and says the child is hers. While talking with Ginny's father Zion (Nathan Mitchell) one day, Paul suspects that Ginny might have gotten an abortion when Zion alludes to a difficult situation his daughter recently went through. Paul then confronts Georgia and realizes she was faking the pregnancy all along.",
      "Is Georgia really pregnant this time?",
      "In the very last scene of the Season 3 finale, Georgia enters her kitchen and starts drinking milk right from the bottle. Ginny then addresses her mother, saying, \u201cMom, didn't you say you drink milk when you're pregnant?\"",
      "Georgia looks at the bottle with wide eyes and Ginny takes a deep breath as the show rolls into the credits and plays a lullaby.",
      "Earlier on, Georgia had also taken one sip of wine when she got acquitted of murder then dumped the rest of the glass into the sink, only further suggesting that she could be pregnant.",
      "Who could the father of Georgia's child be?",
      "If Georgia really is pregnant, she'll now need to figure out who the father is. After all, she recently slept with Paul after he moved home temporarily (ya know, when she faked a pregnancy), so he's a contender.",
      "Then there's Joe (Raymond Ablack), who has admired Georgia for years but only recently made his move when she was ready to skip town.",
      "Joe stops by Georgia's house to check on her after watching a press conference where Paul said he was divorcing his wife. After telling Joe that she was running away to avoid prison time, Georgia kisses him. Ever the gentleman, Joe seems hesitant to get physical while Georgia is so emotionally distraught, but one thing leads to another and they start ripping their clothes off.",
      "One night, Paul is at Joe's caf\u00e9 venting about Georgia and lets it slip that he was going to stay with his wife after learning she was pregnant. This comes as news to Joe, who is curious to know when Paul and Georgia slept together.",
      "After Georgia is exonerated, Joe visits her and she fesses up about all the murders she's committed, telling him she feels \"safe\" with him. They start kissing again and then she stops, saying her children need her to settle down for a bit since she promised Ginny she'd be different. They then share a hug.",
      "If Georgia is indeed pregnant, the paternity of her child will be in question in Season 4.",
      "While speaking with TODAY.com, Howey teased the upcoming season, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to get messy. And on this show, nothing is ever simple.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is slapping sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court over the tribunal\u2019s investigation into alleged war crimes by Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza and in the West Bank.",
      "The State Department said Thursday that it would freeze any assets that the ICC judges, who come from Benin, Peru, Slovenia and Uganda, have in U.S. jurisdictions. The move is just the latest step that the administration has taken to punish the ICC and its officials for investigations undertaken against Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cAs ICC judges, these four individuals have actively engaged in the ICC\u2019s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.\u201d",
      "In February, The Hague-based court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, was placed on Washington\u2019s list of \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons,\u201d barring him from doing business with Americans and placing restrictions on his entry into the U.S. Khan stepped aside last month pending an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct.",
      "Within minutes of the administration\u2019s announcement, the court condemned its actions. \u201cThese measures are a clear attempt to undermine the independence of an international judicial institution,\u201d ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said in a statement.",
      "The new sanctions target ICC Judge Reine Alapini-Gansou, who is from the West African country of Benin and was part of the pre-trial chamber of judges who issued the arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. She also served on the bench that originally greenlit the investigation into alleged Israeli crimes in the Palestinian territories in 2021.",
      "The 69-year-old was also part of the panel of judges who issued the arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023. Last year, a court in Moscow issued a warrant for her arrest.",
      "From Slovenia, Beti Hohler was elected as a judge in 2023. She previously worked in the prosecutor\u2019s office at the court, leading Israel to object to her participation in the proceedings involving Israeli officials. Hohler said in a statement last year that she had never worked on the Palestinian territories investigation during her eight years as a prosecutor.",
      "Bouth Luz del Carmen Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Carranza, from Peru, and Solomy Balungi Bossa, from Uganda, are appeals judges at the ICC. Each woman has worked on cases involving Israel.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor Israel is a member of and neither recognizes the legitimacy of the court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes over his military response in Gaza after the Hamas attack against Israel in October 2023. Israel strongly denies the allegations.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump targeted the ICC with sanctions, voicing displeasure with investigations into Israel and complaints about alleged war crimes said to have been committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Those sanctions were rescinded by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration in early 2021.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. would continue to take action to protect its and Israel\u2019s interests at the court. \u201cThe United States will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our sovereignty, that of Israel, and any other U.S. ally from illegitimate actions by the ICC,\u201d he said.",
      "Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions \u201caim to deter the ICC from seeking accountability amid grave crimes committed in Israel and Palestine, and as Israeli atrocities mount in Gaza, including with U.S. complicity.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. sanctions on ICC judges are a flagrant attack on the rule of law at the same time as President Trump is working to undercut it at home,\u201d Evenson said in a statement. \u201cSanctions are meant to put a stop to human rights violations, not to punish those seeking justice for the worst crimes.\u201d"

      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",

      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",

    "story": [
      "The Russia-backed Wagner Group said Friday it is leaving Mali after more than three and a half years of fighting Islamic extremists and insurgents in the country.",
      "Despite Wagner\u2019s announcement, Russia will continue to have a mercenary presence in the West African country. The Africa Corps, Russia\u2019s state-controlled paramilitary force, said on its Telegram channel Friday that Wagner\u2019s departure would not introduce any changes and the Russian contingent will remain in Mali.",
      "\u201cMission accomplished. Private Military Company Wagner returns home,\u201d the group announced via its channel on the messaging app Telegram. It said it had brought all regional capitals under control of the Malian army, pushed out armed militants and killed their commanders.",
      "Mali, along with neighbors Burkina Faso and Niger, has for more than a decade battled an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.",
      "As Western influence in the region has waned, Russia has sought to step into the vacuum, sweeping in with offers of assistance. Moscow initially expanded its military cooperation with African nations by using the Wagner Group of mercenaries. But since the group\u2019s leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash in 2023, after mounting a brief armed rebellion in Russia that challenged the rule of President Vladimir Putin, Moscow has been developing the Africa Corps as a rival force to Wagner.",
      "Africa Corps is under direct command of the Russian defense ministry.",
      "According to U.S. officials, there are around 2,000 mercenaries in Mali. It is unclear how many are with Wagner and how many are part of the Africa Corps.",
      "Beverly Ochieng, a security analyst specializing in the Sahel for Control Risks consultancy, said the Russian defense ministry had been negotiating with Mali to take on more Africa Corps fighters and for Wagner mercenaries to join Russia\u2019s state-controlled paramilitary force.",
      "\u201cSince the death of Prigozhin, Russia has had this whole plan to then make the Wagner Group fall under the command of the Ministry of Defense. One of the steps they made was to revamp or introduce the Africa Corps, which is the way in which the Russian paramilitaries would retain a presence in areas where the Wagner group has been operating,\u201d Ochieng said.",
      "Wagner has been present in Mali since late 2021 following a military coup, replacing French troops and international peacekeepers to help fight the militants. But the Malian army and Russian mercenaries struggled to curb violence in the country and have both been accused of targeting civilians.",
      "Last month, United Nations experts urged Malian authorities to investigate reports of alleged summary executions and forced disappearances by Wagner mercenaries and the army.",
      "In December, Human Rights Watch accused Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group of deliberately killing at least 32 civilians over an 8-month span.",
      "The announcement of Wagner\u2019s withdrawal comes as the Malian army and the Russian mercenaries suffered heavy losses during attacks by the al-Qaida linked group JNIM in recent weeks.",
      "Last week, JNIM fighters killed dozens of soldiers in an attack on a military base in central Mali.",
      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the major losses might have caused the possible end of Wagner\u2019s mission.",
      "\u201cThe lack of an official and mutual announcement from both the Malian authorities and Wagner indicate possible internal dispute which led to this sudden decision. Simultaneously, this could point to a new framework for Russian presence in the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Replacing Wagner with Africa Corps troops would likely shift Russia\u2019s focus in Mali from fighting alongside the Malian army to training, said Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.",
      "\u201cAfrica Corps has a lighter footprint and focuses more on training, providing equipment and doing protection services. They fight less than the \u2018Rambo-type\u2019 Wagner mercenaries,\u201d Laessing said."

    "summary": "An aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures.",
    "story": [
      "Leaders of an aid organization that has sent more than 100 Haitian children with serious cardiac conditions to the U.S. for heart surgery said President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from 19 countries will stall or cancel lifesaving procedures for at least a dozen children or young adults.",
      "The ban, which goes into effect Monday, has led to widespread uncertainty for many and drawn condemnation from international leaders. The proclamation issued Tuesday offered exceptions for those who are lawful permanent U.S. residents and those traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup and the Olympics, among other examples. No such mention was made for cases of medical necessity, such as those who are seeking treatment in the U.S. through the International Cardiac Alliance.",
      "The International Cardiac Alliance\u2019s total waitlist for Haitians, ranging from infants to young adults, totals at least 316 people who need heart surgery, said Executive Director Owen Robinson. Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "The Prime Minister\u2019s office said Saturday that the body of Thai citizen Nattapong Pinta was returned to Israel in a special military operation.",
      "Pinta was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in captivity near the start of the war, said the government.",
      "This comes two days after the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages were retrieved. Fifty-five hostages remain in Gaza, of whom Israel says more than half are dead.",
      "The defense minister said Saturday that Pinta\u2019s body was retrieved from the Rafah area. He had come to Israel from Thailand to work in agriculture.",
      "The army said he was taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children. It\u2019s also the same group that took the two Israeli-American hostages, Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai, whose bodies were retrieved by the army Thursday.",
      "Israel said it found Pinta\u2019s body based on information received from the hostage task force and military intelligence.",
      "A statement from the hostage forum, which supports the hostages, said it stands with Pinta\u2019s family and shares in their grief. It called on the country\u2019s decision makers to bring home the remaining hostages and give those who have died a proper burial.",
      "Thais were the largest group of foreigners held captive by Hamas militants. Many of the Thai agricultural workers lived in compounds on the outskirts of southern Israeli kibbutzim and towns, and Hamas militants overran those places first. A total of 46 Thais have been killed during the conflict, according to Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Before Pinta\u2019s body was retrieved, three Thai hostages remained in captivity and two were confirmed dead. The fate of Pinta was uncertain until today, according to the hostage forum.",
      "The retrieval of Pinta\u2019s body comes as Israel continues its military campaign across Gaza. Hospital officials said they received the bodies of nearly two dozen people Saturday.",
      "Four strikes hit the Muwasi area in southern Gaza between Rafah and Khan Younis. In northern Gaza, one strike hit an apartment, killing seven people including a mother and five children. Their bodies were taken to Shifa hospital.",
      "Israel said Saturday that it\u2019s responding to Hamas\u2019 \u201cbarbaric attacks\u201d and is dismantling its capabilities. It said it follows international law and takes all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 55 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians."

      "\u201cI heard a buzzing sound, then my dad ran to me and covered me with his hand, then there was a very loud explosion,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole life flashed before my eyes, I already thought that was it. I started having a panic attack... I\u2019m shocked that I\u2019m alive.\u201d",

      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\u201d Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \u201cBased on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds, was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2018 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere."
