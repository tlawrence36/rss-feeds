The program is to be repeated the following night.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs is suing NBC Universal over a documentary that he says falsely accuses him of being a serial murderer who had sex with underage girls as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for NBC Universal and the entertainment company that produced the documentary, which is also named in the suit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The documentary premiered last month on Peacock TV, the network\u2019s streaming service.",
      "\u201cFrom his childhood to becoming a mogul, this raw look at Sean Combs\u2019 journey through exclusive footage and candid interviews explores his rise, controversies and the man behind the music,\u201d a description of the documentary on Peacock\u2019s website reads.",
      "Combs, who is seeking no less than $100 million in damages, has been in Brooklyn federal prison since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",
      "Federal prosecutors say he used his wealth and influence to coerce female victims and male sex workers into drug-fueled, dayslong sexual performances known as \u201cFreak Offs.\u201d",
      "They say Combs used blackmail and violence to intimidate and threaten his victims in a pattern of abuse that goes back to the early 2000s.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is slated to start in May.",
      "Erica Wolff, an attorney for Combs, said NBC and the other entities named in the suit \u201cmaliciously and recklessly broadcast outrageous lies\u201d in order to \u201cline their own pockets\u201d by driving viewership to the documentary.",
      "\u201cIn making and broadcasting these falsehoods, among others, Defendants seek only to capitalize on the public\u2019s appetite for scandal without any regard for the truth and at the expense of Mr. Combs\u2019s right to a fair trial,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. Combs brings this lawsuit to hold Defendants accountable for the extraordinary damage their reckless statements have caused.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 lawsuit says the documentary \u201cfalsely, recklessly, and maliciously\u201d accuses him of murdering Kimberly Porter, Christopher Wallace and Dwight Arrington Myers, among other notable names.",
      "Porter, a model who had been Combs\u2019 longtime girlfriend and the mother of some of his children, died in 2008 at the age of 47 from complications from pneumonia.",
      "Wallace, the rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., was killed in 1997 in a still-unsolved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles at age 24.",
      "Myers, the rapper known as \u201cHeavy D,\u201d died from a pulmonary embolism in 2011 at the age of 44.",
      "\u201cIt shamelessly advances conspiracy theories that lack any foundation in reality, repeatedly insinuating that Mr. Combs is a serial killer because it cannot be a \u2018coincidence\u2019 that multiple people in Mr. Combs\u2019s orbit have died,\u201d the complaint reads.",
      "Elsewhere, the complaint says the documentary delved into claims Combs had sex with underage girls, citing as evidence a civil complaint that's been \u201cthoroughly discredited.\u201d Combs\u2019 lawyers say the women referenced in that complaint have since confirmed they were adults at the time.",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.",
      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America.",
      "The reporter, whom the AP would not identify, tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Later, a second AP reporter was barred from a late-evening event in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room.",
      "The highly unusual ban, which Trump administration officials had threatened earlier Tuesday unless the AP changed the style on the Gulf, could have constitutional free-speech implications.",
      "Julie Pace, AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called the administration's move unacceptable.",
      "\u201cIt is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,\u201d Pace said in a statement. \u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the moves, and there was no indication any other journalists were affected. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media. On Friday, the administration ejected a second group of news organizations from Pentagon office space.",
      "Before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump announced plans to change the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 and signed an executive order to do so as soon as he was in office. Mexico\u2019s president responded sarcastically and others noted that the name change would probably not affect global usage.",

      "The AP said last month, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that it would continue to refer to the Gulf of Mexico while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP says it must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.",
      "AP style is not only used by the agency. The AP Stylebook is relied on by thousands of journalists and other writers globally.",

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky may take the risk of taking the stand in his own defense on Tuesday at his trial over two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",
      "Tacopina said before the trial that Rocky was \u201ceager to tell his story. He would love the opportunity to do so.\u201d",
      "The attorneys could not give comment outside court Monday because a judge has forbidden them from speaking to the media. Rocky faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted, after turning down a pre-trial plea deal that could have led to just 180 days in jail.",
      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",
      "Rocky is a Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear Tuesday to watch his testimony.",
      "She has shown up sporadically \u2014 most recently on Friday, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, would likely testify that a gun he fired twice \u2014 in a scuffle with a former friend on a Hollywood street corner in 2021 \u2014 was a starter pistol that only fired blanks, and that he carried it for security.",
      "On Monday, his tour manager became the second witness from Rocky's inner circle to testify that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Lou Levin said he told the rapper it made sense to carry it after Rocky's house had been broken into by a stalker and others.",
      "\u201cSecurity and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Levin said. \"It\u2019s just a nonlethal form of self-defense.\u201d",
      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to come up with a story \u2014 it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Levin said."

      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:38:30 -0500",
    "summary": "&ldquo;Salutations",
    "story": [
      "\u201cSalutations",
      "\u201cSalutations!,\u201d the actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam introduced Kendrick Lamar at New Orleans\u2019 Caesars Superdome for the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 a powerful, commanding creative choice by the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot.",
      "As if there were any doubts of the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper's ability to put on a show.",
      "As dozens of dancers emerged from a Buick GNX clown car style, he launched into an as-yet-untitled new song that had been teased with an online snippet when his \"GNX\" album was released, then moved into \u201cSquabble Up.\" For just under 13 minutes during the halftime show sponsored by Apple Music and Roc Nation, Lamar commanded the field.",
      "Dancers dressed in red, white and blue joined Lamar. But even in their patriotic colors, they were labeled \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d by Jackson's Uncle Sam, who reminded Lamar to \u201cplay the game.\u201d Then, he launched into \u201cHumble.,\u201d \u201cDNA.,\" \u201cEuphoria\" and \u201cman at the garden.\u201d",
      "\u201cScore keeper, deduct one life,\u201d Jackson interrupted again. Lamar launched into \u201cpeakboo,\u201d and then teased a performance of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanna play their favorite song but you know they love to sue,\u201d Lamar told the women dancers behind him, referencing Drake.",
      "It is hard to underscore the ubiquity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 with its billion streams on Spotify, the massive hit is a regional anthem for Los Angeles, a rallying cry for community and against culture vultures, a diss track that won Lamar the highly-publicized feud with Drake and the track that won song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend.",
      "Leading up to the Super Bowl, whether or not Lamar would perform the song was a legitimate question held by fans and critics alike. Lamar levels strong accusations against Drake in its lyrics; Drake has sued Universal Music Group for defamation as a result of the song's popularity. Does a Super Bowl performance further complicate things?",
      "Little was known about Lamar's halftime performance ahead of time. Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared his recent album \u201cGNX\u201d and was featured on a couple songs including \u201cGloria\u201d and \u201cLuther,\u201d which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \u201cIf This World Were Mine.\u201d The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.",
      "SZA appeared on stage for \u201cLuther\" and \u201cAll the Stars.\"",
      "\u201cThat's what America wants \u2014 nice and calm,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "And then, like clockwork: Lamar launched into \"Not Like Us\" \u2014 with the removal of the word \u201cpedophiles\u201d in its lyrics \u2014 into \u201ctv off.\u201d",
      "He brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.",
      "Is there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL\u2019s championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.",
      "\u201cRap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\u201d Lamar said in a statement in September, when he was first announced as the 2025 halftime performer. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\u201d",
      "Make no mistake about it \u2014 that's exactly what he did Sunday evening.",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Dog folk often call the Westminster Kennel Club show the Super Bowl of canine competitions",
      "NEW YORK -- They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.",
      "Sorry \u2014 no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.",
      "Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.",
      "\u201cI always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl \u2018the Westminster of football,\u2019 \u201d quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.",
      "And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster\u2019s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)",
      "Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.",
      "\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be here. And now we\u2019re here,\u201d Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.",
      "A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 350 champion-level contestants in one of dogdom's most popular sports.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, very natural -- probably smarter than me,\u201d handler Emily Klarman told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.",
      "A sizeable, black-and-white dog named Gable won a special award for the best mixed-breed competitor.",
      "Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillion mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.",
      "She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.",
      "His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.",
      "\u201cHe's always exciting \u2014 he does ridiculous things,\u201d she said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs Saturday. \u201cWe have fun, regardless what happens.\u201d",
      "While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly-Labradoodle mix, used to be \u201cafraid of the world\u201d but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.",
      "Saturday's canine competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a seven-pound (0.9-kg) papillion, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.",
      "They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.",
      "Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.",
      "Westminster\u2019s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.",
      "That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.",
      "Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl \u2014 because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.",
      "There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of organized chaos,\u201d Hillary Brown said with a chuckle after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break are a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.",
      "\u201cIt's a blast. The dogs love it,\u201d Brown said.",
      "___",
      "This story corrects that the dog named Cookie won a ribbon, not the overall prize, in obedience.."

      "NEW YORK -- Tony Roberts, a versatile, Tony Award-nominated theater performer at home in both plays and musicals and who appeared in several Woody Allen movies \u2014 often as Allen's best friend \u2014 has died. He was 85.",
      "Roberts\u2019 death was announced to The New York Times by his daughter, Nicole Burley.",
      "Roberts had a genial stage personality perfect for musical comedy and he originated roles in such diverse Broadway musicals as \"How Now, Dow Jones\" (1967); \"Sugar\" (1972), an adaptation of the movie \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"Victor/Victoria\" (1995), in which he co-starred with Julie Andrews when she returned to Broadway in the stage version of her popular film. He also was in the campy, roller-disco \"Xanadu\" in 2007 and \"The Royal Family\" in 2009.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never been particularly lucky at card games. I\u2019ve never hit a jackpot.

      "Roberts also appeared on Broadway in the 1966 Woody Allen comedy \"Don't Drink the Water,\" repeating his role in the film version, and in Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" (1969), for which he also made the movie.",
      "Other Allen films in which Roberts appeared were \"Annie Hall\" (1977), \"Stardust Memories\" (1980), \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" (1982), \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986) and \"Radio Days\" (1987).",
      "\u201cRoberts\u2019 confident onscreen presence \u2014 not to mention his tall frame, broad shoulders and brown curly mane \u2014 was the perfect foil for Allen\u2019s various neurotic characters, making them more funny and enjoyable to watch,\u201d The Jewish Daily Forward wrote in 2016.",
      "In Eric Lax's book \"Woody Allen: A Biography,\" Roberts recalled a complicated scene in \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" that Allen shot over and over \u2014 even after the film had been edited \u2014 to get his intended effect.",
      "\"When you go back to see (Allen's work) two, three, four times, you begin to see the amazing amount of art in it, that nothing is accidental,\" Roberts said.",
      "Among his other movies were \"Serpico\" (1973) and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" (1974).",
      "He was nominated twice for a Tony Award \u2014 for \"How Now, Dow Jones\" and \"Play It Again, Sam,\" when he was billed as Anthony Roberts.",

      "Roberts, who made his Broadway debut in 1962 in the short-lived \"Something About a Soldier,\" also was a replacement in some of its longest-running hits including \"Barefoot in the Park,\" \"Promises, \"Promises,\" \"They're Playing Our Song,\" \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway,\" \"The Sisters Rosensweig\" and the 1998 Roundabout Theatre Company revival of \"Cabaret.\"",
      "\u201cI was lucky enough to get in on the last years of the Golden Age of Broadway. In that era there was a lot more going on that seemed to have high quality about it and great conviction,\u201d he told Broadway World in 2015.",
      "In London, he starred with Betty Buckley in the West End production of \"Promises, Promises,\" playing the Jack Lemmon role in this stage version of \"The Apartment.\"",
      "Roberts' television credits include the short-lived series \"The Four Seasons\" (1984) and \"The Lucie Arnaz Show\" (1985) as well as guest spots on such well-known shows as \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Law & Order.\"",
      "Roberts was born in New York on Oct. 22, 1939, the son of radio and television announced Ken Roberts.",
      "\"I was raised in the middle of a lot of actor talk,\" he told the AP in 1985. \"My cousin was Everett Sloane, who was a very fine actor. My father's friends were mostly actors. I'm sure that in some way I needed to prove myself in their eyes.\"",

      "LOS ANGELES -- In the hit movie \u201cWicked,\u201d those famous magical shoes are silver. But if you want to see them in all their ruby-red glory from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d there\u2019s no place like home \u2014 their current home, that is, at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.",
      "There, Dorothy\u2019s shoes, worn by Judy Garland, are now on display as part of a sweeping exhibit on the history of color in cinema. It\u2019s a history in which the sequined slippers play a key role.",
      "While the 1900 novel by Frank L. Baum described them as silver, filmmakers in 1939 wanted to pack as much color as possible into the scene where Dorothy steps from sepia-toned Kansas into the shimmering color of the Land of Oz, where Glinda gives her the shoes off the feet of the Wicked Witch of the East. They were showing off a new technology: Technicolor.",
      "The exhibit, \u201cColor in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema,\u201d running through July 13, is timely not only because everything Oz is new again.",
      "It also highlights the largely unsung role that women played in the development of color in Hollywood, not only on screen but off, where labor-intensive jobs like hand-coloring and stenciling gave them a foothold in a male-dominated industry.",
      "There's also a fanciful interactive installation where your own body creates cinematic explosions of color, on the spot.",
      "Here are some highlights:",
      "Those glistening slippers nestled against a wall \u2014 rather unobtrusively, given their iconic status \u2014 began their life as white silk pumps. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d costume designer Adrian (known by his first name) dyed them red and embellished them with nearly 5,000 sequins.",
      "One of four known pairs used for the film that still exist, they were secured with great fanfare and help from luminaries like Leonardo DiCaprio, and were displayed when the museum opened in September 2021.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the biggest treasures we have in our collection,\u201d says Jessica Niebel, curator of the color show. \u201cEver since they came down, we\u2019ve gotten regular visitor feedback asking to see the ruby red slippers back on display. This was the perfect opportunity.\u201d",
      "The shoes are silver in both Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and in Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d on which the Broadway show and movie are based.",
      "Some nine years after \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d another movie put a pair of red shoes front and center. They were ballet pointe shoes, and the film, fittingly, was \u201cThe Red Shoes.\u201d",
      "The sad story of a young ballerina forced to choose between her career and a romance, the movie , by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starred Moira Shearer, a real-life ballerina. Its tragic 17-minute dance sequence tells a story within a story \u2014 a young woman who dances in the red shoes until she dies.",
      "Curators placed these prized red pointe shoes front and center because, Niebel says, \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d highlights both the magical nature of red and the role color plays in the expression of physical movement through dance.",
      "Poignantly, the pointe shoes are not perfect, but worn \u2014 just as the character\u2019s white dress turns gray and dirty as she is gradually consumed.",
      "Silent films were in black and white, right?",
      "Well, no, actually. In this gallery, silent film excerpts show that many were in color. \u201cIn the 1920s, most films, 80-90%, we think, were in color,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cThey only became black and white with the arrival of sound.\u201d",
      "Before that, the majority of films where were tinted and toned, curators say, meaning an entire filmstrip is submerged in one color, often a bright one like yellow or pink or red or blue.",
      "Curators went to four film archives in Europe and the U.S. and scanned their filmstrips. \u201cIn this gallery, for the first time, you can see how these colors authentically looked in the 1920s without any digital manipulation,\u201d Niebel says.",
      "Another section describes a phenomenon many know nothing about: leader ladies. These were women who appeared in the lead frame of a film reel to be processed in a color lab. They were invisible to audiences, but used to calibrate and process the color in a film.",
      "The display raises the issue that this process, which has disappeared with the digital age, largely excluded people of color.",
      "\u201cPredominantly they used to be white women,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cSo film stock and film materials were calibrated towards white skin predominantly. We wanted to tell this story as well \u2014 the story of these women who are never named, who the public never saw, but also the story of how film stock was developed particularly to depict white skin.\u201d",
      "The show begins with images of Lo\u00efe Fuller and the Serpentine Dance she invented, where colored light was reflected onto a flowing costume, changing the colors. An American dancer, Fuller experimented in the early 20th century with fabric, movement, and color techniques like gels and chemical salts.",
      "But many other women toiled in obscurity. There were, for example, the women at Disney, as the studio made a transition to color. We learn that under the leadership of Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell, the studio's ink and paint department became the animation industry\u2019s first all-female unit.",
      "And the French production company Path\u00e9 employed young women to hand-paint films \u2014 frame by frame \u2014 early in the 20th century. These young women earned less than their male counterparts. Still, it was more than they were able to earn in other professions.",
      "As kids know from finger painting, there\u2019s nothing more fun than making color yourself \u2014 especially color that moves. That\u2019s the takeaway from a final gallery in which your own physical movement creates cascades of color.",
      "\u201cBody Paint,\u201d by artist Memo Akten, allows you to stand in front of a screen, spread your arms, jump up and down or move any which way you want as a camera translates the moves into color.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time for visitors to become animators of colors themselves through their own bodies,\u201d Niebel says. She's seen people stop and perform full-on dances at the installation.",
      "\u201cIt seems to bring people together,\u201d she says."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:10:17 -0500",

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "The unit at Bangui Community University Hospital was closed by the health ministry on Feb. 3 following the deaths, which are being investigated. The inquiry panel is also assessing the quality of service delivery at the hospital.",

      "Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them",
      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",
      "",
      "One employee working in a different location said they had heard that supervisors were going to have to return to work full-time sooner than non-supervisory employees, and that there might still be some \"ad hoc\" telework agreements. There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",
      "",
      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",
      "",
      "One thing that might affect whether and when HHS employees return to the office full-time is any collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with the federal government. \"In the OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need to be resolved through the collective bargaining process before employees that were represented by the unions could actually return to the office,\" the employee added. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union, represent different swaths of HHS employees.",

We're going to give infectious disease a break for about 8 years.\" Later, in a September 2024 editorial for the Wall Street Journal, in which he endorsed Trump for president, Kennedy suggested that half of the NIH's budget should be directed to \"preventative, alternative, and holistic approaches to health.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said, as HHS secretary, Kennedy will have \"certain flexibility\" to allocate where research dollars are spent, but at NIH in particular, Congress funds certain centers and programs. So, \"without congressional action to readjust those financial flows, he's going to have relatively limited ability to make the kind of radical changes that he wants to see,\" he noted.",
      "",

      "Paul Offit, MD, a former member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at CDC and a current member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, noted that if the FDA's vaccine advisory committee recommends a vaccine be licensed and the FDA agrees, the HHS secretary could disagree. \"He can say, 'I think this vaccine hasn't been tested well enough,'\" or even that existing vaccines have not been tested enough.",
      "",
      "Kennedy has previously made such arguments. In 2021, he lobbied the FDA to revoke the authorization of the COVID vaccines, even while thousands of people were dying weekly from the virus. In recent months, however, Kennedy has appeared to moderate his stance, telling Republican senators that he won't take away vaccines and that he just wants to make safety and efficacy data more readily available.",
      "",
      "But Offit noted that Kennedy still believes vaccines cause autism despite \"abundant evidence\" that they do not. \"When he says ... 'I just care about vaccine safety,' what he really means is he wants to see studies done to confirm his immutable, fixed, science-resistant beliefs,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Donald Berwick, MD, president emeritus of the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Boston and a former CMS administrator under President Obama, noted that to change vaccination policies reflected in CDC regulations, an HHS secretary would have to follow the rule-making process and provide a 30- or 60-day comment period under the Administrative Procedure Act.",

      "",
      "Gostin argued that making vaccine bans the \"holy grail\" of an anti-vaccine agenda is flawed, given the many ways Kennedy, as HHS secretary, could potentially undermine trust in immunizations. Although he has the power to reverse an approval, Kennedy might hesitate to do so given the \"enormous\" backlash he could face, and likely would instead undermine vaccines in other ways  --  such as by appointing vaccine skeptics to advisory committees such as ACIP, he said.",
      "",
      "Balla pointed out that there are stipulations in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that govern how these committees are constituted and operate. When there's an opening, usually a call is issued in the Federal Register and an open application process follows. Balla also noted that a share of seats are reserved for certain stakeholders to ensure committees are balanced.",
      "",
      "In the \"bad old days\" before FACA, Balla said, committees would hold non-public meetings and be stacked with certain types of stakeholders. The balance and solicitation requirements seek to prevent that. \"So, that makes it harder to, just by fiat, change the composition of the advisory committee,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Still, as Gostin pointed out, the CDC director makes nominations for the advisory committees, and appointments are ultimately determined by the HHS secretary. And Kennedy, by leveraging anti-vaccine allies on these committees, could ensure that even approved vaccines would not receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "",
      "\"Even more insidiously,\" he added, \"he could cherry-pick data, [and] use misleading health communications to foment doubt and distrust in certain vaccines,\" and \"a number of red states\" would likely change their school immunization requirements as a result.",
      "",
      "Additional Checks and Balances",
      "",
      "Other forces could limit Kennedy's plans, but for Offit, Congress is unlikely to be one of them. \"The mere fact that they might confirm him tells you that you should worry about them ever pushing back\" on his actions, he said.",
      "",
      "Kennedy's confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, and he has a hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Thursday.",
      "",
      "For Jha, one check on Kennedy's power is the sheer number of rules that government officials have to follow. \"It's hard to make reform inside government ... You can do window dressing, but substantive reform is very, very hard, and I don't know that [Kennedy has] got the team or the capability or the patience to do it,\" he said. Plus, if he's not careful, lawsuits will inevitably follow, he added.",
      "",
      "\"The truth is that I think the biggest bulwark against really egregious behavior is likely to come from the courts,\" Jha said. \"I think at least for the next 2 years ... if anybody is doing anything, it's going to be the courts.\"",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Turkey's president, accompanied by a high-level delegation, arrived in Pakistan's capital late Wednesday night on a two-day visit to discuss how to boost trade and economic ties between the nations, officials said.",
      "When his plane landed at an airport near Islamabad, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan was received by his Pakistani counterpart Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and other senior government officials.",

      "The two main candidates vying for Ecuador\u2019s presidency never campaigned in Cochapamba",
      "COCHAPAMBA, Ecuador -- The two candidates vying for Ecuador\u2019s presidency in a second-round run-off never campaigned in Cochapamba. Their faces are nowhere to be seen in this remote Indigenous community in the Ecuadorian highlands. Yet, their eyes are set on this and other small towns across the Andean country that will be key in the April 13 election, which will give the winner a full four-year term.",
      "People here are loyal to Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza, who appeared on Sunday\u2019s ballot but finished a distant third after receiving half a million votes. In April, however, they will have to decide between President Daniel Noboa or leftist lawyer Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "The run-off will be a repeat of the 2023 snap election, prompted by the dissolution of the National Assembly, in which Noboa earned a truncated 16-month presidency after the wealthy businessman campaigned on controlling Ecuador\u2019s crime wave of recent years.",
      "Situated at more than 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) above sea level, Cochapamba is home to approximately 6,000 people, whose livelihoods center around cultivating and selling white onions. They are all Indigenous and speak Kichwa and Spanish.",
      "Last Sunday, residents of Cochapamba went out to vote, with some walking for up to two hours to reach a poll station and cast their votes.",
      "While the official results from the National Electoral Council have not yet been broken down to such a local level, the official tally shows that in Sunday\u2019s vote, the province of Cotopaxi \u2014 where Cochapamba is located \u2014 37.6% voted for Noboa and 29.3% for the Indigenous leader Iza. Gonz\u00e1lez came in third, with 27.7% of the vote.",
      "In 2023, in the second round that again pitted Noboa against Gonz\u00e1lez, more than 72% of Cochapamba voters favored the former, a candidate they have never seen in person. It now remains to be seen who they will support in three months.",
      "\u201cWe thought (Noboa) was a young man who was really going to make a difference, but up to this point, at least for me, he has lied,\u201d said Fernando Perdomo, a 46-year-old member of the Decentralized Autonomous Government (GAD), as the local authority in Cochapamba is called.",
      "As for Gonz\u00e1lez, a lawyer with limited political experience, locals view her with distrust as the political heir of former President Rafael Correa, who governed Ecuador from 2007 through 2017. He grew increasingly authoritarian in the latter years of his presidency and was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.",
      "Correa \u201cdisdained Indigenous people,\u201d said Perdomo, adding that now the local community is waiting for instructions from the leadership of the confederation of Indigenous peoples of Ecuador to decide which candidate they will support in the runoff.",
      "Yet, the overall mood in Cochapamba is of distrust \u2014 and disappointment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be deeply disappointed if all the candidates' promises were forgotten,\u201d said Gloria Llugsha, a 28-year-old mother of two. In her view, presidents only remember the people when they need their support.",

      "YANGON, Myanmar -- Supporters and opponents of Myanmar\u2019s military government are engaged in a bloody civil war, but a celebration on Wednesday feted something almost all find worthy: the use of thanakha, a yellowish-white paste made from ground tree bark as a traditional natural cosmetic.",
      "Thanakha-painted cheeks are ubiquitous in Myanmar, where women and children apply the paste on their cheeks, nose, forehead, neck, forearms and shins after their morning showers, during the day and before bed. It\u2019s not unusual for men to apply it on their faces. Now the tradition will be considered by the U.N.\u2019s cultural agency.",
      "Myanmar is applying to add thanakha to UNESCO's world Intangible Cultural Heritage list. The use of thanakha is believed to date back over 1,000 years. Murals showing is use can be seen in 11th century-temples in the old capital Bagan, a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "Thanakha comes from the bark of several tropical sandalwood tree species that grow in central Myanmar\u2019s dry zones, which are currently the stronghold of armed resistance to the army.",
      "Foes of military rule are also devoted users of the paste, and in early demonstrations against the military\u2019s 2021 seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, used it to paint protest symbols on their faces.",
      "Members of 36 social organizations, ranging in age from 5 to 80, came together on Wednesday in a park in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s biggest city, to showcase thanakha as a symbol of Myanmar society by competing in traditional songs and dances. Outside the performance area, about a dozen stalls sold bunches of chopped thanakha wood and cosmetics made from thanakha.",
      "Sandar Khin, chairperson of the Myanmar Cultural Heritage Trust, which organized the competition, said it was being held to highlight the culture of thanakha and help bring it to world attention.",
      "Thanakha was initially proposed for inclusion on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list in March 2020, but the application was rejected for being incomplete. The military government\u2019s Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture is working to submit a new nomination by the end of March.",
      "If recognition is achieved, thanakha will become Myanmar's second intangible cultural heritage to be recognized by UNESCO, after its traditional water festival of Thingyan was added last December.",
      "Myanmar has already specified the full-moon day of Tabodwe, the 11th month in Myanmar\u2019s traditional calendar, as \u201cMyanma Thanakha Day.\""

      "Israel\u2019s defense minister says \u201call hell will break loose\u201d if Hamas does not release three hostages as planned this weekend",
      "JERUSALEM -- Israel\u2019s defense minister on Wednesday vowed that \u201call hell will break loose\u201d on Hamas if it fails to free hostages this weekend as planned, stepping up threats against the militant group as mediators worked to salvage their ceasefire.",
      "There were signs that the gaps could be bridged. The dispute was sparked when Hamas accused Israel of failing to meet some commitments under the truce, including the delivery of tents and other aid, and said it would delay the next hostage release on Saturday.",
      "Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi told The Associated Press there were \u201cpositive signals\u201d the three hostages will be released as planned on Saturday but the group had not yet received a commitment from Israel that it would adhere to the deal.",
      "An Egyptian official with knowledge of the talks said the two sides were close to an agreement. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations, said Israel had committed to delivering more tents, shelters and heavy equipment to Gaza.",
      "Israeli officials had no immediate comment. Israel says it is fulfilling its obligations under the deal, which went into effect on Jan. 19 and has paused the 16-month war in Gaza, bringing respite to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "In the ceasefire\u2019s current first stage, which is to last 42 days, Israel is to deliver large quantities of aid. Hamas is meant to free 33 hostages taken during its cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Eight of them are said to be dead. Twenty-one have been released so far, along with hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody.",
      "Hamas\u2019 threat to delay the hostage release sparked fury from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to resume the fighting if Hamas didn\u2019t follow through and ordered troops to be strengthened around Gaza. They pulled back from the territory's populated areas during the ceasefire.",
      "On Wednesday, Defense Minister Israel Katz said he was echoing U.S. President Donald Trump by threatening that \u201call hell will break loose\u201d if there is no hostage release on Saturday as planned.",
      "\u201cIf Hamas stops releasing the hostages, then there is no deal and there is war,\u201d he said during a visit to a military command center. He said the \u201cnew Gaza war\u201d wouldn\u2019t end until Hamas was defeated, which would allow for Trump\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d on transferring Gaza\u2019s population to neighboring countries to be realized.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Hazem Kassem rejected \u201cthe language of U.S. and Israeli threats\u201d and called on Israel to implement the terms of the ceasefire deal. Among other claims, Hamas says Israel is not allowing an agreed-upon number of tents, prefabricated homes and heavy machinery into Gaza.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s stability has also been rocked by Trump, who has proposed relocating Palestinians out of Gaza to neighboring Arab countries so the U.S. can \u201cown\u201d and rebuild the territory \u2013 not necessarily for its current inhabitants.",
      "Jordan and Egypt, where Trump wants Palestinians moved, have repeatedly and vehemently rejected the proposal. Jordan's King Abdullah II did so again after his meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "Trump has also suggested Hamas release all the hostages yet to be freed under the ceasefire\u2019s first phase at once \u2013 which emboldened Israel to call for more hostages to be freed on Saturday. The releases have been gradual and almost weekly so far.",
      "The latest ceasefire dispute came as Israel and Hamas were expected to begin negotiations on a second phase of the deal, which would extend the truce, bring about the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and see the remaining living hostages freed.",
      "But there appears to have been little progress on those talks.",
      "Netanyahu is under pressure from his political partners, on whom he relies to remain in power, to resume the war after the first phase. But he also faces surging outrage from many Israelis, who are stunned by the emaciated condition of the three hostages released last Saturday and want him to follow through with the deal.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Three weeks into the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the number of tents and temporary homes entering Gaza risks falling short of the goals set for the deal's first phase.",
      "The looming deficit sits at the heart of a dispute between Israel and Hamas that could topple the tenuous truce.",
      "Hamas has indefinitely delayed the scheduled release of three hostages on Saturday, accusing Israel of obstructing the delivery of tents, pre-fabricated homes and heavy machinery into the devastated territory, where the majority of people are displaced and many live beside the rubble of blasted-out buildings.",
      "Israel rejects the accusation, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to withdraw from the ceasefire in Gaza and resume the war if Hamas does not release more hostages on schedule.",
      "Getting enough shelter into Gaza has been difficult because aid workers prioritized deliveries of food at the start of the ceasefire. Israeli inspections and restrictions on what can enter Gaza also complicates the process.",
      "The delivery of temporary shelters could soon ramp up. Resolution of the dispute was in sight on Wednesday, according to an Egyptian official with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where things stand with aid into Gaza:",
      "The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas says that during the first 42-day phase, Israel must allow at least 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents into Gaza. It also must allow entry of an agreed-upon amount of equipment for rubble removal.",
      "Repairs to Gaza\u2019s badly damaged electricity, water, sewage and communications systems \u2014 as well as its torn up roads \u2014 are to begin during phase one. So is the planning process for rebuilding homes decimated by the war. All of the repairs and planning are being overseen by the U.N. and ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar.",
      "Simply removing the rubble \u2014 let alone beginning reconstruction \u2014 could take decades, according to the U.N. It may also be premature, especially if the ceasefire falls apart and Israel resumes its bombing campaign there. U.S. President Donald J. Trump\u2019s stated intention to rebuild Gaza as the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d adds uncertainty.",
      "In the deal's first phase, Hamas is to release 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas so far has released 16 of the hostages, in addition to five Thai hostages who were not part of the deal.",
      "Whether the exchanges continue, the agreement says, depends on how the parties adhere to its regulations on humanitarian aid, among other stipulations.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou told the AP Tuesday that Israel had so far permitted 20,000 of the stipulated 200,000 tents into the territory since Jan. 19, when the deal took effect.",
      "He said Israel hadn't let any temporary homes in and was not allowing entry of heavy machinery necessary to remove the rubble and recover dead bodies.",
      "A U.S. official and an aid worker involved in tracking deliveries into Gaza, said reports from the ground indicate that no prefab homes have been allowed in. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli defense body that coordinates the deliveries of humanitarian supplies, disputed that, saying in a statement that it had allowed hundreds of thousands of tents in since the ceasefire took hold, as well as shelter supplies.",
      "But the U.S. official said the number of tents reported by aid groups to be entering Gaza was far from the amount reported by COGAT. The aid worker estimated that between 25,000 and 50,000 tents had entered since the start of the ceasefire.",
      "An Israeli official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 30,000 tents had entered and that no prefab homes had entered as of Tuesday morning.",
      "Aid workers say a number of factors are complicating the quick delivery of tents and other temporary shelters into Gaza. For one, the priority at the start of the ceasefire period was getting food and water into a territory on the brink of famine.",
      "Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said humanitarian groups \u201cprioritized bringing in food during the first couple of weeks of the ceasefire to address Gaza\u2019s acute starvation crisis.\u201d",
      "Also, anticipating \u201cmass population movements,\u201d aid groups held back from sending tents in immediately because people would have a hard time carrying them along with all their belongings, she said. The latest report from the coalition of groups tracking population movement in Gaza says that at least 586,000 Palestinians have gone north since late January and over 56,000 have moved south.",
      "Ramping up shelter supplies so suddenly proved a tall order, said Tania Hary, the director of Gisha, an Israeli organization dedicated to protecting Palestinians\u2019 right to freedom of movement. She added that the initial focus in the first days of the ceasefire was meeting the threshold of 600 trucks a day.",
      "\u201cThey're scrambling to get in all the tents in their pipeline,\" she said. \u201cGetting in 60,000 caravans is a huge production.\u201d",
      "There is another factor slowing the pace of aid deliveries: Israel deems some items \u201cdual-use,\u201d meaning they could potentially be diverted for military means.",
      "According to a list circulated to humanitarian aid groups by COGAT, \u201cmobile homes\u201d and large tents require Israeli inspection, even though they are on the list for being fast-tracked. The same goes for cleaning materials, water trucks, generators, metal waste containers, sewer inspection devices and iron waste containers.",
      "Large storage tents, desalination facilities, toilets and showers with certain kinds of metal, x-ray machines and diesel generators require an even more intense approval process.",
      "Mediators are hopeful they can resolve the dispute by Saturday and get the ceasefire back on track.",
      "The Egyptian official involved in the talks said Wednesday it was nearly resolved. He said Israel had committed to delivering more tents, shelters and heavy equipment to Gaza.",

      "Austria\u2019s president gave Kickl a mandate to try to form a new government on Jan. 6 after other parties' efforts to put together a governing alliance without his Freedom Party failed.",
      "But his talks with the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party appeared increasingly troubled in recent days, with constant talk of policy differences and a clash over who would get which ministries.",
      "On Wednesday, Kickl informed President Alexander Van der Bellen that he was giving up the mandate to form what would have been the first national government headed by the far right since World War II.",
      "Kickl\u2019s anti-immigration and euroskeptic party, which opposes sanctions against Russia, won Austria\u2019s parliamentary election in September. It took 28.8% of the vote and beat then Chancellor Karl Nehammer\u2019s People\u2019s Party into second place.",
      "But in October, President Alexander Van der Bellen gave Nehammer the first chance to form a new government after Nehammer\u2019s party said that it wouldn\u2019t go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl and others refused to work with the Freedom Party at all.",
      "Those negotiations collapsed in the first few days of the new year and Nehammer resigned, making way for interim Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.",
      "Kickl pointed the finger at the People's Party for the collapse. In a letter to the president released by his party, he said that his prospective parties had insisted on sharing out the ministries in a new government before clearing up disputed policy points and they had been unable to reach an agreement.",
      "\u201cI do not take this step without regret,\u201d he added. But he said that there appeared to be no point in trying to negotiate with the center-left Social Democrats, the only other party with which the Freedom Party could reach a parliamentary majority. It has refused to work with Kickl's party.",
      "\u201cAustria has no time to waste,\u201d Kickl said.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what will happen next \u2014 whether Austria will move on to a new election, whether other parties will make another effort to form an alternative coalition, or whether a nonpartisan government of experts might be appointed for at least an interim period.",

      "The second paragraph has been corrected to say \u201cwithout,\u201d not \u201cwith\u201d the Freedom Party."

      "JUBA, South Sudan -- South Sudan\u2019s deputy president is threatening to immediately withdraw from a fragile peace agreement with the president over a government reshuffle that saw the removal of multiple senior officials this week.",
      "Riek Machar, whose political rivalry with President Salva Kiir has in the past exploded into civil war, said in a statement Wednesday he will \"walk out of the agreement\u201d reached in 2018 if two of the officials fired by Kiir are not reinstated within 24 hours. They are Health Minister Yolanda Awel Deng and Gen. Alfred Futuyo Karaba, governor of Western Equatoria state.",
      "Other sacked officials include two other vice presidents and the spy chief.",
      "Machar said the dismissals violate the 2018 power-sharing agreement following which he returned to Juba, the capital, with the title of first vice president of South Sudan. His side \u201cwill not tolerate continued violations of the peace deal,\u201d his statement said.",
      "There was no immediate comment by Kiir or his government.",
      "South Sudan has five vice presidents, according to the 2018 agreement, which ended five years of civil war and was reached with the help of the U.S. and others.",
      "There were high hopes for peace and stability once oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. But the country slid into civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir started battling those loyal to Machar.",
      "The 2018 peace agreement is yet to be fully implemented. Challenges include the government\u2019s failure to implement promised reforms such as completing the unification of the army command. Presidential elections, repeatedly postponed, are now scheduled for 2026.",
      "United Nations experts have previously warned that the stability of South Sudan remains at risk because of missed deadlines and political gridlock on key issues in the unity government\u2019s agreement.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry is offering new financial and other benefits it hopes will attract men in the 18 to 24 age group to military service",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry is offering new financial and other benefits that it hopes will attract men between ages 18 and 24 to military service, as its short-handed armed forces toil on the front line against Russia\u2019s bigger army in the almost three-year war.",
      "Men in that age group are currently exempt from the country\u2019s draft, which covers men between 25 and 60 years old. Last spring, Ukraine lowered the conscription age from 27 to 25, but that has failed to replenish ranks or replace battlefield losses.",
      "Also, some draft-age men have moved abroad, while desertions have undermined the army.",
      "Ukrainian forces are slowly being pushed backward in some eastern areas, as uncertainty has taken root over whether the Trump administration will keep sending vital military aid. The Biden administration had urged Ukraine to lower the draft age to 18.",
      "Volunteers joining the new program are eligible for a one-time signing fee of 1 million hryvnias (around $24,000) in addition to a monthly salary of 120,000 hryvnias (around $2,900), Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said on the ministry\u2019s website late Tuesday.",
      "Other benefits include being eligible for a 0% mortgage rate, a government scholarship for higher education, additional health care benefits such as dental care, permission to leave the country after one year of service, and a draft waiver for 12 months after the end of their contract.",
      "The offer risks vexing people already in uniform.",
      "For example, military personnel engaged in rear guard activities such as command, planning, air defense, supply and logistics start at approximately 30,000 hryvnias ($720) a month, according to public information on the Defense Ministry website.",
      "Only soldiers engaging in \u201cdirect participation in hostilities\u201d and deployed to the front line are currently eligible for monthly pay of at least 120,000 hryvnias ($2,900). It wasn't clear whether the Defense Ministry proposes paying that amount to younger recruits if they serve in rear guard areas.",
      "The Defense Ministry\u2019s proposal also comes as the government faces continuing criticism for its refusal to establish a legal framework and time frame for demobilizing soldiers.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary's nationalist prime minister on Wednesday hosted a German far-right party's candidate for chancellor in Germany's upcoming elections, a rare gesture from a sitting European leader to a party which Germany's mainstream politicians are trying hard to contain.",
      "Viktor Orb\u00e1n met with Alice Weidel, co-leader of Alternative for Germany or AfD, in Hungary's opulent Carmelite Monastery, Orb\u00e1n's headquarters, where they held talks Wednesday morning. In a news conference following their meeting, Orb\u00e1n said the AfD's support in Germany had reached a level where other parties would find it possible to cooperate. Until now, most European parties have kept their distance from the AfD.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely clear that the AfD is the future,\" Orb\u00e1n said, adding that all of the far-right party's platform, from immigration to the economy, would be \u201cbeneficial for Hungary\u201d if it were implemented in Germany.",
      "Orb\u00e1n's decision to meet with Weidel was a break from the right-wing nationalist's earlier policy of keeping the AfD at arm's length despite their similar views on issues like immigration and belief that the European Union plays too strong a role in the affairs of its member countries.",
      "Before the news conference Wednesday, Orb\u00e1n posted to social media: \u201cToday I met the future of Germany. It was an honour to welcome you in Budapest, Chairwoman Alice Weidel!\u201d",
      "Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party governing coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country\u2019s stagnant economy.",
      "Recent polls have shown the AfD in second place ahead of the election, with support of about 20%. However, other parties say they won\u2019t work with it, and Weidel has no realistic path to becoming Germany\u2019s next leader.",
      "On Wednesday, Weidel said Hungary represents \"a symbol for us, for Alternative for Germany, a symbol of reason and a symbol of sovereignty and independence. I would like that for our country too.\u201d",
      "\u201cHungary is the bulwark against illegal migration, and we as Alternative for Germany also want no illegal migration in our country any more,\u201d Weidel continued.",
      "Both leaders harshly criticized the EU's immigration and climate policies, arguing they were disabling the European economy. Orb\u00e1n said that both should be \u201cthrown out.\u201d",
      "The Hungarian leader's willingness to meet with Weidel was the latest outside endorsement for the AfD, which has been placed under observation by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism \u2014 an accusation the AfD strongly rejects.",
      "In December, tech billionaire Elon Musk drew strong criticism in Germany for endorsing the AfD. In January, he amplified the party's message on his X social media platform by hosting a livestream with Weidel.",
      "Musk said he was \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that Germans vote for the AfD in upcoming elections.",
      "Large numbers of demonstrators have taken to the streets in Germany in recent weeks to protest the far-right and insist that Germany's mainstream parties uphold their unwritten promise to never pass any rule or resolution in parliament that relies on the support of a far-right party.",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.",
      "Hegseth's strident comments came during the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to the Ukrainian government.",
      "What they heard was that President Donald Trump is intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine, including a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops. Hegseth said the force should not have Article Five protections, which could require the U.S. or the 31 other nations of the NATO alliance to come to the aid of those forces if they end up in contact with Russian forces.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s stark message, and his insistence that Russia should keep some territory that Ukraine wants back, is likely to complicate talks later this week between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other senior American officials at a major security security conference in Munich.",
      "\u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d Hegseth said, as Kyiv\u2019s backers gathered at NATO headquarters for a meeting to drum up more arms and ammunition for the war, which will soon enter its fourth year.",
      "All 32 allies must agree for a country to join NATO, meaning that every member has a veto.",
      "\u201cInstead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Hegseth insisted that NATO should play no role in any future military mission to police the peace in Ukraine and that any peacekeeping troops should not be covered by the part of NATO\u2019s founding treaty that obliges all allies to come to the aid of any member under attack.",
      "Article Five has been activated only once, when European allies and Canada used the collective security guarantee to help the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on New York and Washington.",
      "Hegseth also said Europe \"must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine currently relies equally on Europe and the U.S. for about 30% each of its defense needs. The rest is produced by Ukraine itself.",
      "Addressing the allies of Ukraine known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, he also insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western backers must abandon the \u201cillusionary goal\u201d of returning the country to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and seized parts of eastern Ukraine.",
      "\u201cMembers of this contact group must meet the moment,\u201d Hegseth said to the approximately 50 member countries that have provided support to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe hear you,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Both Hegseth and Healey spoke in front of journalists at the top of a closed-door session in Brussels to discuss future aid to Ukraine.",
      "Over nearly three years, those 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as the chair of the group since its creation.",
      "But the meeting this week was convened by the United Kingdom, and no decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn\u2019t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won\u2019t stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "Trump has promised to end the war quickly. He\u2019s complained that it\u2019s costing American taxpayers too much money and suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Hegseth in his remarks said that NATO member nations also need to significantly increase defense spending to 5% of their budgets \u2014 a high mark that the U.S. does not presently meet either.",
      "\u201cThe United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependence. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security,\" Hegseth said.",
      "European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 of them are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product, but a third still fall short.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to Ukraine.",
      "Before Hegseth spoke, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told The Associated Press that Putin will only negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine if its backers continue to provide enough weapons and ammunition.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure that he has no other option, and that means to force him to the table,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cHe needs to understand that we will not give up on Ukraine. We have to make sure that we have maximum economic impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's remarks come a day after American history teacher Marc Vogel returned safely to the U.S. after three years in a Russian prison. The White House suggested that his release could help to advance negotiations on ending the war.",

      "Syria\u2019s relations with Iran and Russia remain an open wound for the country\u2019s people after the nations backed autocratic President Bashar Assad during its long war",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Syria's relations with Iran and Russia remain an open wound for its people after those nations backed autocratic President Bashar Assad during the long civil war, the country's new, interim foreign minister said Wednesday.",
      "Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Asaad al-Shibani acknowledged some \u201cpositive\u201d signs from both Moscow and Tehran but did not elaborate.",
      "However, he underlined the new government in Damascus' desire to improve relations with the West and get sanctions on Syria lifted so the country could start rebuilding after the ruinous, 14-year war.",
      "\u201cSyria has recovered its freedom and dignity\" after decades of despotism, al-Shibani said. \u201cIt's a new period of peace and peace building.\u201d",
      "Al-Shibani's very attendance and address at the Dubai summit was remarkable, reflecting the efforts by the former rebels who ousted Assad in December to gain new friends on the international stage. Qatar and Turkey, one-time rivals of the UAE over their support of Islamists in the region, had far-closer ties to the rebels who ultimately took over Damascus.",
      "The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, had reopened its embassy in Syria in late 2018 as part of a thaw in relations. Assad then visited the UAE in 2022 as Abu Dhabi argued he should be brought back in from the cold among Arab nations, despite the bloodshed by his forces and allies in Syria.",
      "In the immediate hours following Assad's ouster in December, a top UAE diplomat pointedly refused to discuss whether he was in the federation. Assad was later confirmed to have fled and been given sanctuary in Russia, where Vladimir Putin has long been one of Assad's closes allies.",
      "Among key concerns for al-Shibani are the U.S. and European Union sanctions. Estimates suggest it will cost at least $250 billion rebuild Syria, which has a poverty rate of 90% and a gross domestic product of less than half it was before the war, according to the European Union.",
      "The sanctions were imposed on \u201cthe Syrian regime as result of its oppressions,\u201d al-Shibani said. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural to lift\u201d them now.",
      "Al-Shibani, from the northeastern al-Hasakah governorate, is relatively new to the international scene though he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. He had taken part in the 2011 protests against Assad that were part of the Arab Spring uprising, according to a biography published by the Foreign Ministry.",
      "During the war, he used several different noms de guerre and as a member of the former militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, once allied with al-Qaida, he was active in Idlib province. He was named Syria' s interim foreign minister in December after the rebels' lightning offensive ended the Assad family's 54-year rule. A new government is set to take over March 1.",
      "The interim government's former ties to al-Qaida are among the West's concerns with the former rebels and interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Al-Shibani also claimed Wednesday that the interim government had \u201cended all security and Captagon-related challenges \u201d that strained ties with neighboring Jordan. Captagon, an amphetamine-like stimulant, had been a main source of revenue for Assad.",
      "But tensions remain with Russia and Iran.",
      "Moscow hopes to maintain its air and sea base in Syria on the Mediterranean Sea. Iran also has used Syria as a transit point to arm Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and others in its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d against Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cSyrian people have wounds and pain that they suffered at the hands of these two countries,\" al-Shibani said of Russia and Iran.",
      "\u201cIn order to restore the relationship, the Syrian people must feel comfortable with this relationship,\u201d he added.",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- After over a decade in office, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis stepped down on Wednesday and has been replaced by the senate president who will serve in an interim capacity until a new presidential election is held in spring.",
      "Ilie Bolojan, a 55-year-old former mayor and leader of the center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, will serve as acting president at Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest until a successor is elected in a presidential race scheduled for May in the European Union and NATO member country.",
      "\u201cI am fully prepared \u2026 to assume this honorable position,\u201d Bolojan said Tuesday evening as he vacated the PNL leadership position to assume the role of acting president. \u201cI will do so with decency \u2026 working to maintain the stability of our country, ensuring our international partners that Romania is a reliable nation.\u201d",
      "Iohannis, 65, held the presidential role since 2014 and served the maximum of two five-year terms. He announced his resignation on Monday after far-right populist opposition groups \u2014 who hold about a third of seats in Parliament \u2014 sought his ouster via a motion in the legislature.",
      "Although his presidency should have officially ended in December, Iohannis' role was extended after the Constitutional Court annulled a presidential election two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. The court\u2019s decision came after the far-right populist Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round, after which allegations of Russian interference and electoral violations emerged and plunged the country into turmoil.",
      "Romania\u2019s president has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments. However, the role of acting president comes with limited powers.",
      "New dates have been set to rerun the presidential vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later, on May 18.",
      "It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election."

      "Greek lawmakers have elected a former parliament speaker and leading advocate for the return of the disputed Parthenon sculptures from the British Museum as the country\u2019s new president",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greek lawmakers on Wednesday elected as president a former parliamentary speaker and leading advocate for the return of the disputed Parthenon sculptures from the British Museum in London.",
      "Constantine Tassoulas, 65, was elected with 160 votes in the 300-member parliament in the fourth round of voting for the largely ceremonial post. He takes over from Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the first woman to serve as Greece's head of state, who was not nominated for a second five-year term.",
      "Speaking shortly after the results were formally announced, Tassoulas said his election was \u201ca supreme honor for me, but above all a precious responsibility.\u201d",
      "A lawyer by trade, Tassoulas is also a member of the governing center-right New Democracy party and served as culture minister a decade ago, helping reinvigorate Greece\u2019s campaign to reclaim the 2,500-year-old Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles.",
      "During his tenure as culture minister, he hosted lawyer Amal Clooney in Athens, who lent her support to the Greek bid for the sculptures\u2019 return. Clooney, the wife of actor George Clooney, helped raise international awareness of the campaign.",
      "The sculptures were removed from the Acropolis in Athens by British diplomat Lord Elgin in the early 1800s and have since been kept in the British Museum. The Greek government contends their removal was illegal and has long sought their return, seeking to reunite them with other Parthenon artifacts displayed in a museum in the Greek capital.",
      "Greek officials believe the return of the sculptures is more likely now due to the U.K. Labour government\u2019s perceived openness to loan agreements. Ongoing discussions on a potential arrangement would likely include an offer to facilitate rotating exhibitions of ancient Greek artifacts at the British Museum.",

      "Students stood outside shuttered classrooms and roamed aimlessly on Tuesday, when teachers started a two-day strike.",
      "The action by teachers and students comes at a time when public criticism of the government is becoming rarer. Teachers say the strike is significant amid a gradual shrinking of rights, including for women, the press and opposition parties.",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump may be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports",
      "NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump could be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington on Wednesday, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports.",
      "India, a key strategic partner of the United States, has so far been spared any new tariffs, and the two leaders have cultivated a personal relationship. Modi \u2014 a nationalist criticized over India\u2019s democratic backsliding \u2014 has welcomed Trump's return to the White House, seeking to reset India\u2019s relationship with the West over his refusal to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly referred to India as a \u201ctariff king\u201d and pressed the South Asian country on the deportation of migrants. In response, New Delhi has shown a willingness to lower its own tariffs on U.S. products, accept Indian citizens back and buy American oil.",
      "But as tariff threats loom, the question remains how much a good rapport between two leaders matters and how far India will go to cut a deal.",
      "Modi had established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office, and the two can build on the areas of convergence and \u201cminimize areas of friction without conceding on core areas of national interest,\u201d says Meera Shankar, India\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S.",
      "\u201cMost other partners have their reciprocal lists ready from the word go, because it\u2019s a point of leverage when you negotiate,\" Shankar added, expressing hope that India \u201cwill find the right balance between firmness and flexibility\u201d on the tariffs issue.",
      "Modi \u2014 boosted by his ruling Hindu nationalist party's victory in the high-stakes state legislature election last weekend in India\u2019s federal territory, including New Delhi \u2014 said before leaving for Washington that the visit was an \u201copportunity to build upon\" collaboration during Trump's first term and \u201cdeepen our partnership\u201d in areas such as technology, trade, defense and energy.",
      "Speaking with Modi in January, Trump emphasized the importance of India buying more American-made military gear and weapons, as well as reducing the trade imbalance. Last year, the U.S. imported $50 billion more in goods than it sold to India.",
      "A readout from the White House at the time said Trump \"emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, India accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Also, Modi's government lowered some high tariffs, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40%. In 2023, India had dropped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts.",
      "\u201cAnother thing we can expect is that Modi would offer to purchase more American (natural) gas to narrow the U.S. trade deficit,\" said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThis will help a little bit.\u201d",
      "India is seen as integral to the U.S. strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific and is to host a summit of a group of countries known as the Quad \u2014 made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014 later this year.",
      "But India will likely have to recalibrate its stand in case of a Washington-Beijing thaw under Trump.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s outreach to China will complicate India\u2019s ability to cultivate the American desire to use India as a proxy against China without actually ever becoming one,\u201d said Happymon Jacob, founder of the New Delhi-based Council for Strategic and Defense Research.",
      "India turned the page with China and in December agreed to work toward a solution to their long-running border dispute in the Himalayas after a military standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020.",
      "\u201cEven a tactical accommodation between the U.S. and China has implications for India,\u201d Shankar said.",
      "The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trade partner, with a trade deficit of $50 billion in India\u2019s favor. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. According to India\u2019s External Affairs Ministry, the U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.",
      "India depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment, but the war in Ukraine has added to doubts about future supplies, and New Delhi has been looking more toward the U.S., Israel, Britain, and others.",
      "A recently struck deal will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.",
      "Since 2008, India has contracted over $20 billion worth of U.S.-origin defense equipment.",
      "\u201cFor India, that could also be an area where we see some synergies with the U.S.,\u201d Shankar said, adding that Trump will likely seek to persuade India to buy more defense equipment.",
      "Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore, said Modi's visit will be a good time to advance Indo-U.S. ties.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s diplomatic skills will be tested, so the general goodwill that exists between Trump and Modi should be translated into concrete outcomes,\u201d Mohan said.",

They are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give up on the ceasefire framework, and to speed up the timeline of releases if possible.",
      "Their worries about the ceasefire collapsing have been exacerbated by President Donald Trump's demand that all of the hostages be freed by Saturday \u2014 and his insistence that Gaza be emptied of all Palestinians and redeveloped as a tourist enclave controlled by the United States.",
      "The emaciated state of three hostages released last Saturday has infuriated Israelis and terrified families of the remaining hostages, especially as more details come out about the conditions of their captivity.",
      "The situation is especially difficult for relatives of hostages who are not on the list of 33 hostages expected to be released in the ceasefire's first, six-week phase, which began on Jan. 19.

      "On the one hand, each reunion is a step closer to bringing back her son, whom she described as a creative person who loves riding horses and drinking sweet cocktails made with pineapple juice. But Nimrodi does not know if her son, who also holds German citizenship, is alive.",
      "The other two soldiers he was kidnapped with were killed, and she has not received any sign of life from him.",
      "\u201cI know there is a chance I won\u2019t get to the point where I can hold my son,\u201d she said.",
      "According to Israeli media, returning hostages have provided proof of life for at least seven Israeli hostages, including Cohen and Ohel.",
      "Nimrodi doesn\u2019t know what is worse \u2014 to believe her son is dead, or to receive information that he is alive, but held in conditions like Alon Ohel. \u201cI\u2019m scared if Tamir is still alive, I have no idea what he\u2019s going through, I\u2019m scared to even imagine,\u201d she said.",
      "Idit Ohel received the information about her son's condition less than an hour before she went on Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news program earlier this week.",
      "She sat at the news desk sobbing on live TV, pleading with the government to continue to the second stage of the ceasefire and bring all of the hostages home as soon as possible.",
      "Alon, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, is a talented pianist. The family has placed pianos across Israel in his honor, many of which are yellow, the color associated with the struggle for the hostages.",
      "The family marked Alon's second birthday in captivity on Monday evening in Tel Aviv, where his mother addressed the Israeli government. \u201cAfter all the sights you saw, after all the testimonies you heard from the survivors of captivity, how do you allow this situation to continue?\u201d she said.",
      "Alon did remember his younger sister, Inbar, had a birthday on Saturday and delivered her a message through the hostages who were released that day.",
      "\u201cShe got her birthday wish, to hear from her brother, which is incredible,\u201d Idit said, through tears."

    "story": [
      "The White House says news organizations that refuse to use President Donald Trump\u2019s new name for the Gulf of Mexico are telling \u201clies.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- The White House said Wednesday that news organizations that refuse to use President Donald Trump\u2019s new name for the Gulf of Mexico were telling \u201clies\u201d and insisted it would continue to bar Associated Press journalists from presidential events.",
      "Trump has decreed that the international body of water \u2014 which borders Mexico, the United States and other nations \u2014 be called the Gulf of America. In its influential Stylebook, the AP said it would continue to use Gulf of Mexico, while also noting Trump\u2019s decision, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world.",
      "The White House\u2019s outright attempt at regulating language used by independent media \u2014 and the punitive measures attached to it \u2014 mark a sharp escalation in Trump\u2019s often fraught dealings with news organizations.",
      "At a regular briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \u201cit is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America, and I\u2019m not sure why news outlets don\u2019t want to call it that.\"",
      "In reality, the body lies partially in waters that don\u2019t belong to the United States and has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years.",
      "On Tuesday, AP reporters were blocked from attending events in the Oval Office and the White House\u2019s Diplomatic Reception Room. While an AP reporter was in the White House briefing room Wednesday for Leavitt\u2019s remarks, they were turned away at a later event in the Oval Office for the swearing in of Tulsi Gabbard as national intelligence director.",
      "Julie Pace, AP\u2019s senior vice president and executive editor, wrote to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Wednesday objecting to the moves.",
      "\u201cThe actions taken by this White House were plainly intended to punish the AP for the content of its speech,\u201d Pace wrote. \u201cIt is among the most basic tenets of the First Amendment that the government cannot retaliate against the public or the press for what they say.\u201d",
      "The White House pointed out that the AP was allowed into its briefing Wednesday but continued to take issue with the style of the gulf\u2019s name. \u201cNobody has the right to go into the Oval Office and ask the president of the United States questions,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cWe reserve the right to decide who gets to go into the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "Generally, when the press is permitted to cover White House events where space is tight, a small pool of journalists are allowed in. The AP, which transmits news to thousands of clients, has traditionally been a part of that pool in past administrations.",
      "Asked if barring AP reporters was retaliatory, Leavitt said that the Interior Secretary has codified the name change in official documents and that \u201cpretty much every other outlet in this room has recognized that body of water as the Gulf of America.\u201d",
      "The move raised alarms among several advocates for the press. \u201cBarring an AP journalist from covering an Oval Office event because the AP has not adopted President Trump\u2019s change of name to what has long been called the Gulf of Mexico is an affront to the First Amendment,\u201d said noted attorney Floyd Abrams.",
      "A major consortium of news organizations, the Inter American Press Association, said Wednesday that the White House move was \u201can act of censorship and intimidation that violates the freedom of the press enshrined in the United States Constitution.\u201d",
      "The president of the IAPA, Jos\u00e9 Roberto Dutriz, expressed concern about this measure: \u201cRestricting press coverage and warning against the AP demonstrate a troubling intention to impose official criteria on public interest information, with the threat of reprisals for those who do not comply,\" said Jos\u00e9 Roberto Dutriz, CEO and general director of La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica in El Salvador.",
      "Users of the Google map app in the United States will now see the body of water referred to as the Gulf of America, the company said. Mexican users would see \u201cGulf of Mexico.\u201d Elsewhere in the world, Google identifies it as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "But the AP's decision is influential because many news outlets and other organizations use it as an arbiter of how to consistently refer to things.",
      "Some larger outlets have their own rules.",
      "\u2014The New York Times said it would continue to use Gulf of Mexico, while noting Trump's renaming in stories that discuss that issue. The gulf, which borders Mexico and Cuba as well as the United States, has been known as the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years.",
      "\u2014The Washington Post also said it would use Gulf of Mexico in most references because it \u201cis not solely within the United States' jurisdiction and the name of Gulf of America might confuse global readers.\u201d",
      "\u2014Fox News said that, starting Sunday, it would use Gulf of America in all of its references.",
      "Trump has also ordered that the United States' tallest mountain revert back to the name Mount McKinley after President Barack Obama changed the Alaska peak to its Indigenous name, Denali. AP says it would follow Trump's decision because he has the authority to rename areas that are solely within the United States.",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has declined to immediately hear a case that seeks to restore collective bargaining rights lost that tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other public workers lost in 2011",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to hear a case that seeks to restore collective bargaining rights lost in 2011 to tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other public workers.",
      "The court's decision means the case must first go through a lower appeals court before it will likely end up before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Seven unions representing teachers and other public workers in Wisconsin filed the lawsuit seeking to overturn the anti-union 2011 law, known as Act 10. The law had withstood numerous legal challenges before a Dane County circuit court judge in December found the bulk of it to be unconstitutional, setting up the appeal to the state Supreme Court.",
      "The Act 10 law effectively ended collective bargaining for most public unions by allowing them to bargain solely over base wage increases no greater than inflation. It also disallowed the automatic withdrawal of union dues, required annual recertification votes for unions, and forced public workers to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost in December ruled that the law violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. Under the ruling, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place before 2011.",
      "The judge put the ruling on hold pending the appeal.",
      "The law\u2019s introduction in 2011 spurred massive protests that stretched on for weeks. It made Wisconsin the center of a national fight over union rights, catapulted then-Gov. Scott Walker onto the national stage, sparked an unsuccessful recall campaign and laid the groundwork for Walker\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid.",
      "The law\u2019s adoption led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum said in a 2022 analysis that since 2000, Wisconsin had the largest decline in the proportion of its workforce that is unionized.",
      "In 2015, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature approved a right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "If the lawsuit is successful, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power will have it restored. They would be treated the same as the police, firefighter and other public safety unions who remain exempt.",
      "Supporters of the law have said it gave local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions.",
      "Public sector unions that brought the lawsuit are the Abbotsford Education Association; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Locals 47 and 1215; the Beaver Dam Education Association; SEIU Wisconsin; the Teaching Assistants\u2019 Association Local 3220 and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 695."

      "Struggling fabric and crafts seller Joann plans to close about 500 of its stores across the U.S. \u2014 or more than half of its current nationwide footprint",
      "NEW YORK -- Struggling fabric and crafts seller Joann plans to close about 500 of its stores across the U.S. \u2014 or more than half of its current nationwide footprint.",
      "The move, announced Wednesday, arrives amid a tumultuous time for Joann. Last month, the Hudson, Ohio-based retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time within a year, with the company pointing to issues like sluggish consumer demand and inventory shortages.",
      "Joann previously sought Chapter 11 in March 2024 and later emerged as a private company. But after operational challenges continued to pile up, Joann filed for bankruptcy again in January. It\u2019s now looking to sell the business \u2014 and maintained in a filing Wednesday that closing \u201cunderperforming\u201d locations is necessary to complete that process.",
      "\"This was a very difficult decision to make, given the major impact we know it will have on our Team Members, our customers and all of the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201c(But) right-sizing our store footprint is a critical part of our efforts to ensure the best path forward.\u201d",
      "Joann currently operates around 800 stores across 49 states. The initial list of the roughly 500 locations it's looking to close can be found on the company's restructuring website \u2014 spanning states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and more.",
      "When exactly those closures will take place and how many employees will be impacted has yet to be seen. Joann's Wednesday motion seeks court permission to begin the process.",
      "Joann's roots date back to 1943, with a single storefront in Cleveland, Ohio. And the retailer later grew into a national chain. Formerly known as Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, the company rebranded itself with the shortened \u201cJoann\u201d name for its 75th anniversary.",
      "Both of Joann\u2019s bankruptcy filings seen over the last year arrived amid some slowdowns in discretionary spending \u2014 notably with consumers taking a step back from at-home crafts, at least relative to the early COVID-19 pandemic boom. Joann has also faced rising competition in the crafts space from rivals like Hobby Lobby, as well as from larger retailers, like Target, who now offer ample art supplies and kits.",
      "And, while Joann turned to implementing a new business plan after emerging from bankruptcy last spring, \u201cunanticipated inventory challenges post-emergence, coupled with the prolonged impact of an excessively sluggish retail economy, put (Joann) back into an untenable debt position,\u201d interim CEO Michael Prendergast noted in a sworn court declaration filed when Joann initiated its latest Chapter 11 proceedings on Jan. 15.",
      "Prendergast explained that inventory shortages had significant ripple effects on Joann\u2019s core business, particularly when \u201cin-stock levels eventually dropped by upwards of 10%\" and led to a \u201cnew phase of operational distress.\u201d",
      "Citing these and other macroeconomic challenges seen in the retail space over recent years, Joann has maintained that a sale of the business is the best path forward. The company says it has a proposed \u201cstalking horse\u201d bid agreement with Gordon Brothers Retail Partners."

      "The vote comes as Trump wages trade war against much of the world. The president has already slapped a 25% tax on Chinese imports. A 25% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum is scheduled to kick in on March 12. Trump is also preparing to raise American tariffs to match those charged by other countries on U.S. exports.",
      "Economists warn that Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise prices and risk rekindling inflation \u2013 while drawing retaliation from other countries. Trump says they will raise revenue, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries to make concessions on issues both related and unrelated to trade.",
      "Greer, a former Air Force lawyer, was chief of staff to Trump\u2019s first-term trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. In that position, Greer was involved in trade talks with China at a time when the world\u2019s two biggest economies were hitting each other\u2019s products with tariffs in the biggest trade brawl since the 1930s.",

      "The latest monthly consumer price index confirmed what consumers, bakers and food companies already knew: an ongoing bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 are making eggs terribly expensive right now.",
      "The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities reached $4.95 in January, eclipsing the previous record of $4.82 set two years earlier and more than double the recent low of $2.04 that was recorded in August 2023.",
      "Of course, that is only the nationwide average. A carton of eggs can cost $10 or more in some places. And specialized varieties, such as organic and cage-free eggs, are even more expensive.",
      "Prices are only going to get worse. Prices always spike around Easter every year because demand is high around the holiday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted last month that egg prices were likely to go up 20% this year.",
      "And even if consumers can afford eggs, it can be hard to find them at times as some stores have trouble keeping their shelves stocked. Some grocers have imposed limits on how many eggs customers can buy at a time.",
      "The main reason that eggs are more expensive is the bird flu outbreak. When the virus is found on a farm, the entire flock is killed to limit the spread of disease. Because massive egg farms may have millions of birds, just one outbreak may put a dent in the egg supply.",
      "The Agriculture Department says more than 23 million birds were slaughtered last month and more than 18 million were killed in December to limit the spread of the bird flu virus. Those numbers include turkeys and chickens raised for meat, but the vast majority of them were egg-laying chickens.",
      "Egg farmers also face higher feed, fuel and labor costs these days because of inflation. Plus, farmers are investing more in biosecurity measured to try to protect their birds.",
      "Ten states have passed laws allowing the sale of eggs only from cage-free environments. The supply of those eggs is tighter and focused in certain regions, so the effect on prices can be magnified when outbreaks hit cage-free egg farms.",

Its actions involve banks, mortgage servicers, credit card companies, student loan processors, payday lenders, money transfer providers, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors.",
      "During the Biden administration, the CFPB passed rules capping bank overdraft fees and removing medical debt from credit reports. The bureau sued financial services companies for misleading consumers and employers for misleading workers. It also focused on curbing junk fees and predatory lending practices.",
      "Congress established the agency as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. The CFPB says it has obtained nearly $20 billion for consumers since then in the form of monetary compensation, canceled debts, reduced loans and other financial relief.",
      "Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, told the CFPB last weekend to stop its investigations and work on proposed rules. He instructed the agency to suspend the enforcement dates of any rules that had been finalized but not yet put into effect, and closed the CFPB's offices for a week.",
      "Vought sent an email to employees on Monday morning saying they should \u201cnot perform any work tasks.\u201d They were directed to contact the top lawyer for the Office of Management and Budget \u201cto get approval in writing\u201d before doing anything.",
      "Vought also said in a social media post that the agency would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, which Congress assigned as the CFPB's funding source to avoid the political wrangling of the congressional appropriations process.",
      "Two top officials resigned Tuesday in protest. Also Tuesday, Trump named Jonathan McKernan, a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member, as the agency's new director.",
      "Before Trump took office, banks and industry groups sometimes sued to block some of the agency\u2019s rules.",
      "For example, when the CFPB issued a rule in 2017 to limit the number of payments the providers of payday loans, vehicle title loans, and high-cost installment loans could take from customer bank accounts, trade associations for payday lenders challenged the bureau's Federal Reserve funding as unconstitutional. In May 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their argument and upheld the CFPB's funding and oversight model.",
      "Trump on Monday defended his administration\u2019s efforts to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying the agency was \u201cset up to destroy people.\u201d",
      "The overdraft fee rule was finalized and set to take effect in October, but Vought\u2019s directive puts it on hold. Banks had previously sued to get the rule thrown out.",
      "The rule would require the largest banks to pick one of three options: to reduce overdraft fees to $5, to reduce them to a rate that reflects how much an overdraft costs them, or to disclose, along with the fee, the fee\u2019s Annual Percent Rate (APR) as they do with other short-term loans. Overdraft fees currently run about $35 on average.",
      "The CFPB finalized a rule in January that would remove medical debt from credit reports. The agency had said the change could potentially improve the credit scores of millions of people and make it easier for them to get mortgages and other loans. The rule was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register but is now suspended. It also was the subject of a legal challenge.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on lowering prices, and a lot of people voted for him because of high prices. and yet we\u2019re seeing Republicans move to make them pay high overdraft fees and pay more for loans on their credit,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cThe public broadly thinks that overdraft fees are unfair and medical debt shouldn\u2019t be on credit reports. If you ask ordinary people, these are not partisan issues.\u201d",
      "Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, characterized the CFPB\u2019s work under Biden as \u201caggressive.\u201d She said the agency took action in recent years without going through the appropriate procedures.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe they had the proper oversight,\u201d she said.",
      "Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many financial technology companies as members, said her organization anticipates and hopes several CFPB rules, including those governing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans and other fintech products, will be reversed \u201cwith the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "She characterized the rules as \u201coverly broad, overreaching, and harmful.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the CFPB protested outside the bureau's shuttered Washington headquarters this week. NAACP President Derrick Johnson and others have demanded the office's reopening.",
      "\u201cThe CFPB has provided crucial protections against big banks and lenders,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cWithout this critical oversight, consumers \u2014 especially Black and Brown communities \u2014 will be vulnerable to fraud, predatory lending, and discriminatory financial practices.\u201d",
      "Kitty Richards, senior strategic advisor at the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative, said consumers today are more vulnerable to data privacy violations, junk fees, and financial scams. Without the CFPB, corporations are \u201cfreer to prey on the American people without fearing they might have to give back the money,\" she said.",

      "North Carolina House members have advanced a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene by another $500 million",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina House members advanced Wednesday a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene as committees fleshed out details on how best to spend another $500 million to address the historic flooding.",
      "The House's budget-writing committee voted for the latest spending proposal, which would emphasize repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers who lost crops and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent used by small businesses.",
      "GOP House leaders had unveiled a version last week, but several amendments adjusted the measure in a special Helene recovery committee on Tuesday. A House floor vote is expected next week, said Rep. John Bell, the House rules chairman and co-chairman of the recovery committee.",
      "The package remains less than half of the $1.07 billion that new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein sought in new recovery spending earlier this month from legislators.",
      "Stein's package contains several initiatives the House plan currently lacks, including money to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues and for two business grant programs designed to help small businesses directly.",
      "Senate GOP leaders will have their own competing spending ideas that will figure into negotiations with House counterparts. Both Stein and Republican lawmakers want to get more Helene spending out the door early this year to address immediate needs. Additional funds are expected in the two-year state budget that would take effect July 1.",
      "The legislature already has appropriated close to $1 billion since last fall for Helene aid in the weeks after it made landfall in late September.",
      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Eric Ager of Buncombe County offered an amendment Tuesday to create a direct payment program to small businesses that Stein sought, running it through the state Revenue Department.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing businesses in western North Carolina every day and we\u2019ve got to find a solution,\u201d Ager said, adding that it \u201cwould really go a long way in keeping some folks solvent through to the summer when business picks back up again.\u201d",
      "While Ager pulled his amendment before a vote because earlier committee action took away his funding source, Bell suggested to Ager and later to reporters that new language to help small businesses may be considered.",

      "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved a proposal from the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic grid to head off the potential for power shortages",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved a proposal from the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic grid to head off the potential for power shortages but that critics say will effectively fast-track the construction of new natural gas plants.",
      "The commission's Tuesday night decision, in a 3-1 vote, said the proposal by PJM Interconnection is \u201cjust and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\u201d The proposal was originally submitted in December.",
      "PJM, based in Pennsylvania, has said it made the proposal because a power shortage could affect the grid as early as 2026 as demand grows for electricity at the same time coal-fired plants and aging nuclear plants are retiring.",
      "PJM's criteria for an eligible project includes ones that are ready to build, can provide a relatively high power capacity and are likelier to produce electricity when the grid is most likely to see power shortfalls. It said it would open an application period for proposals and select 50 to study.",
      "Clean energy advocates say the process favors gas-fired plants, and they blame PJM for creating the existing reliability problem by taking an unduly long time to study proposed wind and solar energy projects in its project queue.",
      "Proposals awaiting PJM's approval are more than 97% solar, wind or battery storage, according to federal figures. Less than 3% are natural gas.",
      "Some critics questioned PJM's process. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel Office said it will be impossible for consumers to know whether PJM is selecting the most efficient or cost-effective power plants.",
      "Demand for electricity has spiked for the first time in decades, as tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race pursue new power supplies for energy-hungry data centers.",
      "On top of that, cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and bipartisan political pressure to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. are fueling new electricity demand.",

      "\u201cPeople can be confident that we\u2019ll continue to keep our heads down, do our work, and make our decisions based on what\u2019s happening in the economy,\u201d Powell said, under questioning from members of the House Financial Services Committee. Powell spoke on the second day of his semiannual testimony to Congress.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Trump said on social media that \u201cInterest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!\u201d",
      "Yet Powell indicated during a press conference last month that the Fed, after cutting its key rate three times late last year, would hold off on further cuts as it waited for evidence that inflation is moving closer to its 2% target.",
      "And many Fed officials want to wait and see how Trump's policies, including the tariffs he has proposed and those he has put in place, affect the economy. Most economists worry that tariffs will at least temporarily push up inflation.",
      "On Wednesday, the government reported that inflation picked up last month, with consumer prices rising 3% in January from a year earlier, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September. The uptick makes it even less likely the Fed will cut its key rate anytime soon. The Fed's rate influences borrowing costs throughout the economy, including mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.",
      "Powell also said that the Fed \u201chas made great progress\u201d on inflation \u201cbut we\u2019re not quite there yet\" to its 2% target.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s inflation print ... says the same thing,\u201d he added. As a result, the Fed wants to keep rates \u201crestrictive for now,\u201d Powell added. At its current level, the Fed\u2019s key rate is restricting borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, Powell has said.",
      "The Fed cut its key rate to about 4.3% from 5.3% last year. Fed officials in December had forecast that they would implement two cuts this year, but some economists now think the Fed may be on hold all year. Wall Street investors foresee only one cut, in October.",

But when Tuesday passed without the tariffs being officially announced, Trump was asked if he would sign the order on Wednesday and Trump answered: \u201cWe'll see what happens.\u201d On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she believes that the tariffs would come before Thursday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "As Trump has unleashed a series of tariffs after being in power for less than a month, he has fully taken ownership of the path of the U.S. economy. It\u2019s a bet that his economic ideas can eventually deliver meaningful results for voters, even if by Trump's own admission the import taxes could involve some financial pain in the form of inflation and economic disruptions. For all of Trump's talk, the impact will likely depend on the details of the tariffs and how other nations respond.",
      "A reciprocal tariffs order could amount to a substantial tax hike to be shouldered largely by U.S. consumers and businesses as the Census Bureau reported that the country had total imports of $4.1 trillion last year. The tariffs could set off retaliatory measures by trading partners that could roil growth around the globe and reset where the United States stands with allies and rivals alike.",
      "By signing the order, Trump would fulfill his long-standing pledge to raise taxes on most imported goods, a clear break with his recent White House predecessors who saw tariffs as either targeted tools to use strategically or barriers worth lowering. Trump has broken with that precedent by saying he wants to return the United States to the 1890s when taxes on imports were the government's dominant source of revenues.",
      "But should job gains never materialize and should inflation stay high, it's an easy line of attack for Democratic lawmakers and candidates that Trump helped the ultrawealthy at the expense of the middle class.",
      "\u201cNo matter which way you slice it, costs are going to climb for consumers,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said earlier this month. \"I will work with my colleagues to undo this mess, get costs down and get these billionaires out of the way.\u201d",
      "Trump put 10% tariffs on China over its contributions to the production of the illicit drug fentanyl, and China has taken retaliatory measures. He said he is ready if necessary on March 1 \u2014 after a 30-day suspension \u2014 to put tariffs on Mexico and Canada over his belief they should do more to fight illegal immigration and drug smuggling.",
      "On Monday, he closed the exemptions to his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, in addition to raising the tariff rates on aluminum. He has also talked about additional taxes on imported autos, computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "Many of America\u2019s dominant trading partners are preparing for an economic rupture in reaction to Trump's possible actions.",
      "In response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday: \u201cUnjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered \u2014 they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.\u201d That means motorcycles, jeans, bourbon and peanut butter from the United States could face new taxes abroad. Mexico and Canada \u2014 America's two largest trading partners \u2014 have also prepared countermeasures.",
      "Multiple Trump aides have privately said that Trump's long-standing goal with tariffs has been reciprocity. But Trump has also portrayed tariffs as a diplomatic tool to try to force Canada and Mexico to spend more resources on stopping illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States. He also suggested repeatedly that tariffs would be a source of revenues that could offset his planned income tax cuts.",
      "But even before Trump formally signed the order, analysts at Goldman Sachs on Tuesday concluded it was unlikely to be the final word on tariffs.",
      "\"Of course, even if President Trump views reciprocal tariffs as an alternative to more sweeping measures at the moment, we are entering only the fourth week of a four-year presidential term and it seems likely there will be many further tariff announcements,\" the investment bank's analysts wrote.",
      "Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a Sunday note that the \u201ctariff trajectory\u201d would shape what happens with growth, inflation, interest rates and Federal Reserve policies this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a major shift from the era of globalization, when companies shrank expenses by pursuing lower-cost labor and materials offshore,\" Zezas said. \"This transition is likely to take many years, creating challenges for some and substantial opportunities for others.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow to organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people work in remote compounds in countries including Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos where they run online scams targeting people all over the world, including Americans, according to U.N. estimates. Some are trafficked and lured to the jobs under false pretenses and forced to work against their will.",
      "A shelter for people who manage to leave these compounds run by the Catholic charity Caritas recently let some victims go and may stop accepting further victims due to the funding squeeze, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said. The shelter, in the capital Phnom Penh is the only one not operated by the government which takes in victims of scam compounds, both foreign and Cambodian. The sources declined to be named because they were concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration.",
      "The funding freeze has also halted civil-society-assisted rescue work and related programs on preventing human trafficking.",
      "The compounds operate with support from some local elites. Last October, the U.S. sanctioned Ly Yong Phat, a leading member of the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party of Prime Minister Hun Manet, for owning businesses that have trafficked people and forced to work in online scam centers.",
      "The blow to civil society efforts comes as a small network of society and independent media addressing Cambodia\u2019s scam compounds are already under intense government pressure. Independent media outlets have been shuttered, and a prominent Cambodian investigative journalist who had reported on the issue was arrested.",
      "The Trump Administration froze U.S. foreign assistance in January, upending projects all over the world that ranged from providing medications to HIV patients to humanitarian assistance to people displaced by conflict.",
      "While there are other shelters in Cambodia, the one operated by Caritas \u201cis the only qualified and competent shelter,\u201d said Jake Sims, a co-founder of Shamrock, a public-private coalition working to combat transnational organized cybercrime. It offers victims trauma-informed care, as well as help with visas and legal support so they can go back to their home countries.",
      "The Caritas shelter received financial support from Winrock International, USAID\u2019s partner in Cambodia. It was due to receive about $1 million from USAID over the course of two years, the sources said. The shelter was also partially funded by IOM, a United Nations agency which is largely funded by the U.S.",
      "Neither USAID, IOM nor the government of Cambodia responded to requests for comment.",
      "Some people manage to leave the compounds, either making their own escapes \u2014 sometimes jumping out of windows \u2014 or relying on a few rescue operators who assist the Cambodian police. There\u2019s also a Cambodian government rescue hotline.",
      "When victims do get out, they often have trouble returning home. They are usually held in police custody and then sent on to immigration detention where they may linger for months. Many don\u2019t have any savings and may need legal help if they entered the country illegally with smugglers, rescuers say.",
      "Shelters are critical for ensuring victims don\u2019t wind up being trafficked again, said Mina Chiang, founder of Humanity Research Consultancy, which has conducted research on the scam compounds in the region.",
      "\u201cIn 2022, my team and I have learnt cases where Taiwanese survivors became homeless on the streets of Cambodia after escaping the scam compounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have also been cases where survivors were hunted down by criminals after they had escaped.\u201d",
      "Li Ling, a rescue worker who has referred cases to the Caritas shelter, said she has had to stop assisting in rescues of scam workers because of the funding freeze.",
      "Six victims left the shelter as soon as it got a stop-work order, and two of them have subsequently disappeared, said Li, who\u2019s also a PhD student at Ca\u2019Foscari University of Venice studying cyber-enabled modern slavery. She had asked them to stay in regular contact after their departure and said she is concerned they may have wound up back in a scam compound, as they did not have any savings and planned to look for jobs for food and shelter.",
      "Other organizations that support scam center victims have also taken a hit from the funding freeze, such as one which provides medical assistance to victims who injured in escapes, said Li.",
      "For example, last year, they had helped someone who jumped out of a building to escape a scam compound. The organization helped pay for the emergency surgery for the victim, but that source of funds has also stopped.",
      "The funding freeze has also led to the cancellation of other related programs focused on preventing human trafficking.",
      "One non-profit organization registered in the region was due to start a training program with community journalists across Southeast Asia to raise awareness about scam compounds and their recruitment processes. Another labor-focused organization was due to start a training program with labor unions in six Southeast Asian countries on recognizing signs of trafficking, the sources with knowledge of the funding said.",
      "The organizations asked to not be named due to the fear of government retaliation.",
      "Ongoing research funded by to keep track of the latest developments in the scam compounds and the Cambodian government response has also been halted, the source with knowledge of the funding said. Research consultants funded by USAID's counter-trafficking program wrote internal reports for the agency on the criminal activity that are also sometimes shared with Congressional staff, as well as different parts of the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWith U.S. government support now abruptly removed, we can expect an acceleration in civil society repression,\u201d Jake Sims.",
      "Last October, the Cambodian government arrested a well-known investigative journalist who had reported extensively on the proliferation of scam compounds in the country.",
      "After widespread international attention and the support of local media organizations, journalist Mech Dara was released on bail after about a month. Afterward, he made a public statement that he would quit journalism.",
      "Even if new funding is secured, restarting anti-trafficking programs could be more costly, since programs have already been shuttered and contract workers have been let go.",
      "\u201cThe knock-on effect of the USAID funding freeze extends beyond the trafficking and re-trafficking of vulnerable people; it strengthens criminal networks, allowing them to expand their operations,\u201d said Humanity Research Consultancy's Chiang."

      "The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances says it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island\u2019s power company",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances said that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island's power company.",
      "Robert Mujica Jr. unveiled a new fiscal plan for Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority on Tuesday, stating that the government can pay creditors $2.6 billion. The plan, requested by a federal judge overseeing the case, does not call for any rate increases to help pay off the company's debt of more than $9 billion and the projected expenses are higher than those in the previous fiscal plan.",
      "The board remains in contentious mediation with creditors as it tries to restructure the only outstanding debt that remains since Puerto Rico declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone on for too long,\u201d Mujica said of the case. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to get out of this one.\u201d",
      "Economists have said that the unresolved case has spooked potential investors and hampered economic development on the island.",
      "Mujica noted that officials don\u2019t yet know where they would obtain funding for the $2.6 billion they\u2019re offering, but warned it shouldn\u2019t come from an increase in electric rates given already high power bills and the fragile state of Puerto Rico\u2019s grid.",
      "\u201cThe system needs investment,\u201d Mujica said, adding that all revenue should go into fortifying and improving the grid. \u201cPuerto Ricans deserve to have a utility that is performing and that is reliable.\u201d",
      "The island suffers from chronic power outages that worsened after Hurricane Maria razed the grid when it slammed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. However, the grid was already crumbling given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "Mujica said that if the government agreed to bondholder demands, which total $12 billion including interest, it would mean an electric rate increase of up to eight cents that he says Puerto Ricans cannot afford.",
      "The current offering of $2.6 billion, which represents an 80% reduction of the power company\u2019s debt, has been accepted by 44% of creditors and a third of all bondholders.",
      "Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, says the grid needs up to $25 billion in federal funding through fiscal year 2034 to fully rebuild and maintain the system.",
      "Of the $17 billion expected in funding from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, only $3.2 billion has been disbursed, Mujica said.",
      "\u201cThe system right now is deteriorating faster than the investments are being made,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

      "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time",
      "BEIJING -- Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father\u2019s panicked voice: The brakes don\u2019t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car\u2019s brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described \u201c free speech absolutist.\u201d Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang\u2019s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It is not common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China\u2019s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla\u2019s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla\u2019s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party \u2014 are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla\u2019s windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\u201cThe government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\u201d said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \u201cThat\u2019s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\u201d",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang\u2019s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad\u2019s fault because he hadn\u2019t maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\u201d Zhang said in an interview. \u201cI was burning with anger.\u201d",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \u201cTesla brake failure\u201d in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla\u2019s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \u201cTesla Model 3 brakes failed,\u201d she said. \u201cA family of four almost died.\u201d The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \u201cBrakes fail\u201d and headed for Tesla\u2019s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker\u2019s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn\u2019t get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \u201cTesla brakes fail!\u201d",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\u201cThings escalated,\u201d said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang\u2019s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn\u2019t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \u201chad someone behind her\u201d and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive\u2019s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company\u2019s own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang\u2019s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang\u2019s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she\u2019d been asking for, but they\u2019d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn\u2019t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she\u2019d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang\u2019s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world\u2019s most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\u201cI refuse to accept it,\u201d Zhang told the Associated Press, \u201cAs a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\u201d",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it\u2019s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court said that judgments are the result of a \u201cfair trial\u201d based on \u201cthe objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\u201cIt cannot be assumed that the party has received \u2018special protection\u2019 or \u2018special treatment\u2019 because of their victory,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it\u2019s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it\u2019s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\u201d said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \u201cThe odds are stacked against you. It\u2019s like going to the casino and winning every hand.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China\u2019s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China\u2019s financial capital.",
      "With Li\u2019s support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla\u2019s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China\u2019s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world\u2019s largest EV-battery maker. China\u2019s BYD is now the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\u201cTesla had a large part to play in that,\u201d said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk\u2019s factory was critical. \u201cIt was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they\u2019re rolling cars off the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\u201d",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk\u2019s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Musk\u2019s \u201cgreater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\u201d said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job of it in China and he\u2019s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\u201d",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk\u2019s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \u201cmaybe it is time\u201d to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla\u2019s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\u201cWe were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\u201d a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk\u2019s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest\u2019s report that claimed Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory was a \u201csweatshop.\u201d The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla\u2019s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\u201cTesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\u201d said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla\u2019s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \u201cTesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\u201d",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen\u2019s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\u201cTesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\u201d Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. \u201cI almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\u201d",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\u201cI deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\u201d",

      "The pledges were made by India's finance minister earlier this month as part of a plan to expand electricity generation and reduce emissions. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn't emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste. India is one of the world\u2019s biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 \u2014 enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.",

      "An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge.",

      "For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, that has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods now stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says.",
      "For the health commodities alone, not delivering them \u201con time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The filing asserts that the administration has no authority to block programs and funding mandated by Congress without approval.",
      "Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers\u2019 groups.",
      "\u201cInsubordination\u201d and \u201cnoncompliance\u201d by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide what U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote."

      "Drayton died unexpectedly on Monday in Toronto, according to Cardinal Funeral Homes. Runners World magazine said he died during knee surgery.",

He won Detroit's Motor City Marathon in 1969 in a North American record time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and shaved 47 seconds off the mark in winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan later that year.",

      "Two students challenging New Hampshire\u2019s ban on transgender athletes on girls sports teams will also fight President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Two students challenging New Hampshire\u2019s ban on transgender athletes on girls sports teams will also fight President Donald Trump's executive order, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" after a judge approved their request Wednesday.",
      "It's believed to be the first time that the constitutionality of the executive order signed by Trump last week is being challenged in court, according to Boston-based GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, also known as GLAD Law, one of the groups representing the teens.",
      "\"The systematic targeting of transgender people across American institutions is chilling, but targeting young people in schools, denying them support and essential opportunities during their most vulnerable years, is especially cruel,\u201d said Chris Erchull, a GLAD attorney.",
      "Last fall, a federal judge in New Hampshire ruled that the two students can try out for and play on girls school sports teams while the teens challenge the state ban.",
      "The families of Parker Tirrell, 15, and Iris Turmelle, 14, sued in August, seeking to overturn the Fairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act that former Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law in July.",
      "Tirrell is a 10th-grade student who plays on her high school soccer team and Turmelle is a ninth-grade student who plans to try out for tennis in the spring.",
      "\u201cI love playing soccer and we had a great season last fall,\" Tirrell said in a statement. \"I just want to go to school like other kids and keep playing the game I love.\u201d",
      "Trump's order last week gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration\u2019s view, which interprets \u201csex\u201d as the gender someone was assigned at birth.",
      "GLAD and ACLU of New Hampshire asked the judge for permission to add Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, the U.S. Department of Education and acting Secretary Denise Carter as defendants.",
      "An email seeking comment was sent to the White House Press Office.",
      "In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty said she \u201cfinds good cause\u201d for the lawyers to amend the lawsuit.",
      "The lawyers say Trump's executive order, along with parts of a Jan. 20 executive order that forbids federal money from being used to \u201cpromote gender ideology,\u201d subjects the teens and all transgender girls to discrimination in violation of federal equal protection guarantees and their rights under Title IX.",
      "The lawyers also say the executive orders unlawfully subject the teens' schools to the threat of losing federal funding for allowing them to play sports."

      "It\u2019s not just downhill and super-G that Lindsey Vonn wants to compete in at the age of 41 at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics",
      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- It\u2019s not just downhill and super-G that Lindsey Vonn wants to compete in at the age of 41 at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "After experiencing the new team combined at the world championships, Vonn also hopes to qualify for that event when it makes its Olympic debut in 2026 \u2014 even after her campaign to pair with Mikaela Shiffrin this week didn't pan out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to be a part of a team,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that experience in a world championships or Olympics before. I\u2019ve always loved the combined as an individual (event). They don\u2019t have that anymore. So this is my next best option. I get along great with every single member of my team and I would be proud to race with anyone.\u201d",
      "But at the worlds, Vonn was very public about her desire to race with Shiffrin, who ended up winning gold with Breezy Johnson. Vonn and AJ Hurt placed 16th on Tuesday.",
      "The new event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom run, with their times added together to determine the final results.",
      "Shiffrin and Vonn are the winningest female racers in World Cup history with 99 victories for Shiffrin and 82 for Vonn. Vonn is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43 and Shiffrin holds the mark in slalom with 62 \u2014 both records among men and women.",
      "\u201cWould it have been a really cool thing to have 181 wins in one team? I think it would have been,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s best for the team, it\u2019s not me right now. That doesn\u2019t mean that next year things might change.\u201d",
      "Vonn struggled in her downhill run of the combined, finishing 21st and a distant 2.51 seconds behind the leader, American teammate Lauren Macuga. Johnson was fourth, setting up her gold medal with Shiffrin.",
      "That performance by Vonn followed a hooked gate that took her out of the super-G and a 15th-place finish in the downhill.",
      "\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m skiing better than I was before, but from the gliding (standpoint) I am not fast,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never had a problem with. And I just need to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Having recently returned to ski racing with a new titanium knee after nearly six years of retirement, Vonn is playing catch up with her new equipment.",
      "Vonn\u2019s longtime ski technician, Heinz Haemmerle, retired, so equipment supplier Head assigned her Chris Krause, who formerly worked for Didier Cuche and Bode Miller. But then Krause got sick, so she was assigned yet another technician, Rene Meusburger.",
      "Is Vonn trying to convince Haemmerle to follow her out of retirement?",
      "\u201cI think that would be unfair to Heinz. He had a bad accident a few months ago with his leg and he hasn\u2019t skied yet. He\u2019s got a giant scar bigger than mine,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely going to help me. To what degree? I don\u2019t know. But I also want to be fair to him and I don\u2019t want to put him a position where he\u2019s risking his health to help me.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got an amazing position now with Rene. He\u2019s super young and he gets along well with Heinz. I think having the old and the young (techs) together would be a cool and a beneficial partnership. But it\u2019s not all sorted out yet.\u201d",
      "Whoever is tuning her skis will be just as busy after this season ends, when Vonn will embark on a marathon testing session to get her setup up to speed \u2014 likely on European glaciers before moving to South America or New Zealand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be full throttle spring and summer to really get things going,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a matter of getting good enough snow conditions to do that.\u201d",
      "After leaving the worlds, Vonn flew to Switzerland for a teaching arrangement at the Aiglon ski academy. Then she was heading home to Miami.",
      "She\u2019ll return to racing in Kvitfjell, Norway, at the end of the month.",
      "Her long-term goal remains the 2026 Games, having told The Associated Press recently that she plans to retire again after competing in a fifth Olympics. Women's skiing at the Olympics will be held in Cortina d'Ampezzo, where Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup wins.",
      "\u201cI am not really patient, but I really have to try to be kind to myself because even though I have high expectations and I was fourth and sixth in my second and third races back, I still have work to do and I am still 40 and I still have a partial knee replacement,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what to do. \u2026 I just need time to put all the pieces together.\u201d",

      "Horwitz, acquired in a trade with Cleveland in December, will be out at least 6-8 weeks, though Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said Tuesday the team is not putting an exact timetable on a possible return.",
      "The 27-year-old Horwitz hit .265 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs in 97 games with Toronto last season. The Blue Jays shipped him to Cleveland in December and hours later the Guardians sent him to Pittsburgh in exchange for pitcher Luis Ortiz and two prospects.",
      "Horwitz had been dealing with what the Pirates called a \u201cchronic\u201d wrist problem. Cherington said the team was aware of the issue at the time of the trade but Horwitz began to experience \u201cnew symptoms\u201d in late January, which led to the decision to have surgery.",

Hall hit 16 home runs in Triple-A last season.",
      "While outfielder Bryan Reynolds took ground balls at first base during practice late in the 2024 season, Cherington said the team is focused on keeping Reynolds in the outfield.

      "In a move that was largely expected, President Donald Trump\u2019s education officials announced the change Wednesday, saying the memo from former President Joe Biden\u2019s final days in office had no legal basis under Title IX, the 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cThe NIL guidance, rammed through by the Biden Administration in its final days, is overly burdensome, profoundly unfair and it goes well beyond what agency guidance is intended to achieve,\u201d said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights.",
      "A Jan. 16 memo from the Biden administration told universities that NIL payments must be treated the same as athletic financial aid such as scholarships. It sent athletic departments across the country back to the drawing board.",
      "Football and men's basketball players were expected to receive the bulk of the $20.5 million that athletic departments will be allowed to distribute starting next school year. Universities had to figure out whether they needed to change plans to avoid running afoul of the Biden policy, which said NIL payments \u201cmust be made proportionately available to male and female athletes.\u201d",
      "Passed in 1972, Title IX requires that schools pay out financial assistance in proportion to the number of students of each gender who play sports on campus. It also calls for schools to provide opportunities to play varsity sports in proportion to the gender distribution on campus.",

      "There's plenty to see as baseball returns Wednesday for most MLB clubs, with pitchers and catchers officially reporting at sites across Arizona and Florida. The Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers got an early spring training start ahead of their season-opening series in Tokyo, and a few clubs don't get going until Thursday. But for most, Wednesday marks the start of a new season.",
      "That includes the Yankees, who are welcoming back Cole, the 2023 Cy Young Award winner, after he chose to remain with the Yankees rather than opt out of his contract. He'll be joined in the rotation by Max Fried, a key addition as they try to return to the World Series.",
      "New York lost to the Dodgers in five games, failed to bring back Juan Soto in free agency, then signed Fried to a $218 million, eight-year contract, the largest ever for a left-handed pitcher. Fried went 54-25 with a 2.81 ERA over the past five seasons with the Braves and was instrumental in Atlanta's 2021 World Series victory over the Astros.",
      "Wednesday will also be Day 1 for new Cincinnati Reds manager Terry Francona. Cincinnati went 77-85 last season but has some promising young talent, led by young ace Hunter Greene. Francona won two World Series titles with the Red Sox and took Cleveland to the playoffs six times in 11 years. That includes the 2016 World Series.",
      "Los Angeles added even more star power this winter with two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and Japanese phenom pitcher Roki Sasaki. The rotation got another apparent boost Tuesday when Clayton Kershaw showed up for camp. It's been expected the 36-year-old would re-join the Dodgers for an 18th season, but he remained a free agent entering camp.",
      "Of course, the biggest boost to LA's rotation will be Shohei Ohtani's return from elbow surgery that kept him off the mound in 2024. He may provide an update to media Wednesday on his timeline to return.",

      "Pakistan eliminated South Africa from the tri-nation series with centuries from captain Mohammad Rizwan and vice-captain Salman Ali Agha leading the home team to its highest-ever successful run chase in an ODI just a week ahead of Champions Trophy",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- Pakistan eliminated South Africa from the tri-nation series with centuries from captain Mohammad Rizwan and vice-captain Salman Ali Agha leading the home team to its highest-ever successful run chase in an ODI just a week ahead of Champions Trophy.",
      "Rizwan struck an unbeaten 122 off 128 balls and Salman notched his maiden ODI hundred with 134 off 103 balls as they cruised Pakistan to 355-4 in 49 overs for a six-wicket victory Wednesday to set up Friday\u2019s final against New Zealand.",
      "Pakistan's previous highest successful chase was 349 against Australia at Lahore in 2022.",
      "South Africa had earlier posted 352-5 \u2014 fourth-highest total at the newly upgraded National Bank Stadium \u2014 with Heinrich Klaasen (87), Matthew Breetzke (83) and captain Temba Bavuma (82) all missing out on centuries.",
      "It was the second time in three days that South Africa lost after posting over 300 runs as it failed to defend 304 against New Zealand on Monday.",
      "Rizwan and Salman decimated South Africa pace bowlers Lungi Ngidi (1-74), Corbin Bosch (1-70) and Wiaan Mulder (2-79) on a flat wicket and lightning outfield as they shared a Pakistan record of 260 runs in a match-winning fourth-wicket stand.",
      "With frontline pace bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen joining the South Africa squad for Champions Trophy over the weekend, the three pace bowlers couldn\u2019t pose threat to the pair of Rizwan and Salman in ideal batting conditions.",
      "Mulder had struck twice in his opening spell but Pakistan still managed to rack up over 90 runs in the first power play of 10 overs in an ODI for the first time in 20 years with Fakhar Zaman making a quickfire 41 off 28 balls.",
      "Babar Azam made 23 off 19 balls in the opening stand of 57 off 37 balls before Mulder pinned him leg before wicket and then found the outside of Fakhar\u2019s bat with Klaasen holding onto a sharp catch to his left.",
      "Rizwan and Salman took their time and watchfully played out spinners Tabraiz Shamsi (0-53) and Keshav Maharaj (0-54) in the middle overs before countercharging against the pace.",
      "Rizwan reached his hundred off 106 balls in style with a monstrous six over mid-wicket to Mulder, and three balls later Salman completed his first ODI hundred off 87 balls with a single.",
      "Ngidi got some consolation when Salman, who struck 16 fours and two sixes, edged the fast bowler with only two needed for victory before Tayyab Tahir sealed the game with the boundary off the first ball he faced.",
      "South Africa top-order batters also capitalized on a perfect batting wicket with only left-arm spinner Khushdil Shah (1-39) conceding less than run a ball.",
      "Bavuma and Breetzke batted with lot of aggression against pace and spin after Toni de Zorzi (22), one of the four changes South Africa made from the first match, was brilliantly snapped by Salman in the first slip of Shaheen Shah Afridi (2-66).",
      "Breetzke, who became the first batter to score 150 in his debut ODI on Monday, added 119 off 125 balls with Bavuma as Pakistan bowlers gave away too many lose deliveries.",
      "Bavuma, who hit 13 boundaries, got run-out in a mix-up with Breetzke in the 29th over, but South Africa continued to score at a brisk pace after Klaasen was promoted at No. 4 in his first outing in Pakistan.",
      "Breetzke, overlooked for the Champions Trophy, looked set for his second successive century but Salman took up another stunning catch at short cover in the 39th over to deny South African another record.",
      "Klaasen struck 11 fours and three sixes and played a key part in helping South Africa score 110 runs in the last 10 overs before he holed out in the deep in the penultimate over.",
      "Kyle Verreynne made an unbeaten 44 off 32 balls as South Africa middle-order batters charged against the pace of Afridi and Mohammad Hasnain, who conceded 72 runs for no wickets in his eight overs after being inducted into the playing XI in place of injured Haris Rauf.",

    "story": [
      "About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk-contest days were done",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk contest days were done. He'd been in the contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend twice, won it both times with plenty of flair and figured there was nothing else to prove.",
      "Then a week later, he found himself practicing new dunks. And that's when he quickly realized that he has one \u2014 and he insists, only one \u2014 dunk contest left in him.",
      "\u201cI love the contest, man,\" McClung said. \u201cIt'd be an action in fear not to do it again. So, I'll do it \u2014 one last time.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-2 McClung \u2014 a standout guard in the G League who has appeared in only five NBA games \u2014 is headed back to All-Star weekend, looking to become the first person to win the league's dunk title in three consecutive years. Nate Robinson is the only three-time dunk champion, though his didn't come in back-to-back-to-back years.",
      "McClung breathed new life into the dunk contest and got rave reviews from some of the NBA's biggest names when he first won it in 2023, then went airborne over Shaquille O'Neal to win it again last year. Now he goes for three in a row in San Francisco on Saturday night, with San Antonio rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee second-year wing Andre Jackson Jr. providing the competition.",
      "\u201cI'm not going there to lose,\u201d Buzelis said.",
      "Added Jackson: \u201cI just want to be myself and put on a show.\u201d",
      "Castle is confident as well, though acknowledged he expects to feel some nerves on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI get nervous for most games,\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it's just going to be another event for me.\u201d",
      "When this weekend is over, they'll all head back to their NBA jobs. McClung, for now, continues to wait for a real opportunity.",
      "His five NBA games have come with four NBA teams \u2014 one with Chicago, one with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with Philadelphia and one with Orlando. He's scored 33 points in those games, 20 coming in one contest with the 76ers at Brooklyn on April 9, 2023.",
      "He hasn't scored an NBA point since that day.",
      "\u201cThe easy answer is opportunity,\" McClung said. \u201cIt's not just Mac McClung. There's a lot of G League guys that can play in the league. There\u2019s a lot of guys I\u2019ve seen in the G League and then they get an opportunity in the (NBA) and people are like, \u2018Man, he got so much better this last year.' And I'm like, \u2018No, he\u2019s been good.' I really have my faith in God, and believe I\u2019m always right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d",
      "For now, that's with the Osceola Magic. He's on a two-way contract with Orlando, and McClung is averaging 24.5 points and 6.1 assists during this G League regular season. He's been rookie of the year, he's been a G League champion and this season he's the reigning G League MVP.",
      "\u201cI take pride in the G League,\u201d McClung said. \u201cEach year it's so hard because when you're on a two-way people are like \u2018Be ready, stay ready.\u2019 But I'm trying to win in the G League. That's important to me. Winning a championship is always the standard and hopefully we can do that this year in Osceola and apply even more pressure.\u201d",
      "Winning back-to-back dunk contests has brought a ton of notoriety. People recognize McClung more now, but he hasn't changed. He's comfortable in jeans and T-shirts, drives a Ford Bronco, has the same group of friends that will smack him back in line if he gets out of line. He's proud to be the small-town kid from Gate City, Virginia \u2014 who just happens to be able to jump higher than most people and has become one of the most famous dunkers in the world.",
      "He's been offered chances to play in Europe for bigger money than he's making in the G League, too. But the dream remains the NBA, and McClung isn't ready to give up on it. He's always been the underdog and typically has found a way to turn his hopes into reality.",
      "\u201cIt's funny. I don\u2019t even look at myself as a dunker,\" McClung said. \u201cThe people that know me best know I'm a competitor first. Obviously, I haven\u2019t made an impact in the league yet or anything like that, but that\u2019s who I want to be and where I want to be. That\u2019s truly where my heart is.\u201d",
      "He'll be back on the NBA stage on Saturday, with a shot at dunking his way into history.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Seven years after Doug Pederson and Nick Foles delivered Philadelphia its first Super Bowl title, Nick Sirianni and Jalen Hurts did it again with a 40-22 win over Kansas City in Super Bowl 59.",
      "Winning multiple titles in that short a time period is far from rare in the NFL, with the league often dominated by transcendent coach-quarterback combinations.",
      "Doing so with different people in those key positions is extremely unusual. Only two other teams have ever won multiple Super Bowls in a span of eight seasons with a different coach and different quarterback in both wins.",
      "The Raiders broke through with their first title in the 1976 season when coach John Madden and quarterback Ken Stabler led Oakland to a 13-1 record and a Super Bowl win over Minnesota. The Raiders did it again four years later when Tom Flores and Jim Plunkett led them past the Eagles in Super Bowl 15.",
      "The 49ers did it as well as their dynasty extended long past Bill Walsh's retirement. Walsh and Joe Montana collaborated on three championships from the 1981-88 seasons before Walsh stepped down. George Seifert then won the Super Bowl in his first season in 1989 with Montana and again in 1994 with Steve Young at quarterback.",
      "The Raiders had 11 players appear in both Super Bowl wins, while the 49ers had six, including Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and four other players who started on offense in both Super Bowl 23 and 29.",
      "The Eagles had a bigger roster turnover with only right tackle Lane Johnson, defensive end Brandon Graham, kicker Jake Elliott and long snapper Jake Lovato appearing in both wins.",
      "The main constant between Philadelphia's two titles was general manager Howie Roseman, who has now built two championship teams.",
      "The Super Bowl featured firsts for college football powerhouses Alabama and Texas.",
      "Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith\u2019s 46-yard touchdown catch were the first points scored in the Super Bowl by a player who finished his college career at Alabama. NFL scoring rules give credit for points to the player who catches a touchdown \u2014 not who throws it \u2014 so Bart Starr and Stabler\u2019s TD passes didn\u2019t count.",
      "Players who finished their college careers at 144 other schools had scored in the Super Bowl before 12-time AP college football champion Alabama cracked the list.",
      "The win also put Smith in an exclusive club of players with a Heisman Trophy and championships in college and the NFL. Only four other players have done that: Tony Dorsett, Marcus Allen, Charles Woodson and Reggie Bush.",
      "Texas had previously had two kickers score in a Super Bowl with Justin Tucker getting 10 points in Super Bowl 47 for Baltimore and Raul Allegre getting seven for the Giants in Super Bowl 21.",
      "But Xavier Worthy\u2019s two TD catches in the second half for Kansas City were the first touchdowns scored by a player who finished college at Texas, the fifth winningest program in college football history.",
      "One other college got on the Super Bowl scoreboard for the first time with Justin Watson\u2019s 2-point conversion catch the first points scored by a player from Penn. It marked just the second time a player from the Ivy League scored in the Super Bowl with Harvard grad Kyle Juszczyk catching a TD pass for the 49ers in Super Bowl 54.",
      "Hurts drew even with Mahomes in head-to-head Super Bowl matchups.",
      "This game was the fourth rematch between quarterbacks in a Super Bowl with Mahomes and the Chiefs having won in Super Bowl 57. Hurts is the only one to get revenge with the other three all ending in sweeps: Eli Manning over Tom Brady, Troy Aikman over Jim Kelly, and Terry Bradshaw over Roger Staubach.",
      "Hurts also became the fourth player who lost his first Super Bowl as a starting QB to go on to win one as a starter, joining Hall of Famers Len Dawson, Bob Griese and John Elway.",
      "In what was billed as the season of the running back, it was the quarterbacks who led both teams in rushing.",
      "Hurts ran for 72 yards to lead all ball carriers in the game and break his own record of 70 for most ever by a quarterback. The only other quarterback who led the Super Bowl in yards rushing was San Francisco's Steve Young with 49 yards in Super Bowl 29 against San Diego.",
      "Mahomes led the Chiefs with 25 yards rushing, marking the first time that the leading rusher for both teams was a quarterback.",
      "Kansas City got only 24 yards rushing from its running backs for the fourth lowest total ever.",
      "Even Eagles star Saquon Barkley struggled to get going with just 57 yards on 25 carries with his 2.28 yards per carry the worst for any player with at least 20 attempts in a Super Bowl.",
      "That doesn't take away from what Barkley accomplished this season with his 2,504 yards rushing in the regular season and playoffs breaking the record of 2,476 set by Terrell Davis in 1998.",
      "Barkley finished the postseason with 499 yards rushing, trailing only John Riggins (610 in 1982) and Davis (581 in 1997) for the most in a single postseason.",
      "Philadelphia's second Super Bowl win made the NFC East the only division where every team has won at least two Super Bowl titles.",
      "In fact, no other division has all four teams winning even one Super Bowl.",
      "With the five titles by Dallas, four for the New York Giants and three for Washington, the four teams have combined for 14 Super Bowl wins \u2014 four more than any other division.",
      "Next up on the list based on the current affiliations is the AFC West with 10 titles and the AFC East with nine. The NFC West and AFC North each have eight, followed by the NFC North (five), NFC South (three) and AFC South (two).",

    "summary": "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for &ldquo;world-class drivers&rdquo; could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
    "story": [
      "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\u201d could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\" could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500, and, should the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner use the provisional, it would make for the largest field in a decade.",
      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",
      "Three-time Daytona 500 Denny Hamlin said the rule \u201creeks of desperation\u201d by NASCAR, calling it nothing but a gimmick to attract big stars to stock car racing. Others wondered why the provisional went to Castroneves, who at 49 will be making his NASCAR debut, instead of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, a two-time Daytona 500 winner.",
      "The rule is designed for drivers who don't currently race full time in NASCAR, so Johnson and 2017 Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. would have been eligible for consideration for the provisional.",
      "But their teams never put in the request, which must be done 90 days before the event. Only Trackhouse Racing requested the provisional for Castroneves, who enters Wednesday's qualifying as the only driver eligible for the 41st spot.",
      "\u201cI think Jimmie Johnson is a world-class driver, but I guess other people don\u2019t,\u201d Alex Bowman said. \"It\u2019s an interesting rule for sure. There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",
      "If NASCAR does receive multiple requests, NASCAR will decide who the designated \u201cworld-class driver\u201d is ahead of the event. The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

      "There are 36 guys already locked into Sunday\u2019s 500-mile race because their teams own charters, which guarantee them entry into every race on the Cup Series schedule. The remaining four spots are filled by non-chartered cars, often referred to as \u201copen teams.\"",
      "There are nine drivers \u2014 the most since 2015 \u2014 vying for those spots: Anthony Alfredo, Justin Allgaier, Helio Castroneves, Jimmie Johnson, Corey LaJoie, B.J. McLeod, Chandler Smith, Martin Truex Jr. and J.J. Yeley.",

      "Alfredo, 25, returns to Daytona with Beard Motorsports. Alfredo finished 27th with the team last year. He has two top-10s in 41 career Cup starts. Founded by the late Mark Beard Sr., Beard Motorsports is trying to make the field for the seventh time since 2017.",
      "The reigning Xfinity Series champion will be behind the wheel for JR Motorsports\u2019 first attempt at making the Daytona 500. JRM is owned by two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., whose entry is being sponsored by country music star Chris Stapleton. Allgaier, 38, is winless is 82 Cup starts.",
      "Castroneves will make his NASCAR debut in the No. 91 Chevrolet regardless of how he qualifies. The 49-year-old Brazilian is one of four drivers to have won the Indy 500 four times (2001, \u201902, \u201909, \u201921). He has found success at Daytona, too, having won the 24 Hours at Daytona three times.",
      "The seven-time Cup champion and two-time Daytona 500 winner, now the majority owner of Legacy Motor Club, is entering two races this year. The 49-year-old Johnson will be attempting to make his 22nd appearance in the 500 but will have to qualify for the third straight year. Johnson's paint scheme was designed with input from NBA great Shaquille O'Neal.",
      "LaJoie, 33, is running a partial schedule for Rick Ware Racing and trying to make his ninth consecutive Daytona 500. He has three top-10 finishes in the season opener, including a career-best fourth last year.",
      "McLeod, owner and driver at Live Fast Motorsports, sold his charter for a reported $40 million to Spire Motorsports in 2023. It gave McLeod the freedom to pick and choose when and where he races, and Daytona is high on the list. The 41-year-old McLeod has five Daytona 500 starts, with a best finish of 19th.",
      "Smith is attempting to make the race with Garage 66, replacing Mike Wallace in the No. 66 Ford. Smith, who is slated to drive a full Truck Series schedule, last tried (and failed) to make the 500 in 2023 with Kaulig Racing. The 22-year-old Smith has started three Cup races, including a 15th-place showing in the 2023 summer race.",
      "Truex retired from full-time competition last season, but the 2017 Cup champion entered the race with TRICON Garage. His No. 56 Toyota is getting technical support from Joe Gibbs Racing. Truex, 45, is winless in 20 Daytona 500 starts but came home second in 2016 in one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history.",
      "Yeley is trying to make his sixth Daytona 500 and first since 2015. The 48-year-old driver is winless in 386 Cup starts and is partnering with NY Racing Team to pilot the No. 44 Chevrolet.",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A fan fest at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, will be open for all 104 games of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Fan fests with large video screens have been a part of each World Cup's organization since 2006. Plans to have one in New York City's Corona Park no longer are moving forward, but festivities in Central Park remains possible. The one in Jersey City is set.",
      "\u201cThat is going to be the one fan fest, I believe, across the country that is going to be up and running for all games of the World Cup as opposed to just the games that are happening in our region,\u201d Tammy Murphy, wife of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and chair of the New York/New Jersey host committee\u2019s directors, said during an interview Monday.",
      "Murphy's appointment as chair was announced Tuesday along with the hiring of Alex Lasry, a former Milwaukee Bucks executive and son of former Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, as CEO of the host committee. He heads a fulltime staff of about 10.",
      "The World Cup will be co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The tournament, expanded to 48 nations from 32, opens June 11 in Mexico City and the final will be July 19 at East Rutherford, New Jersey. Games will be played at 11 U.S. venues, three in Mexico and two in Canada, with all matches in the U.S. from the quarterfinals on.",
      "\u201cThe final is awesome to have here and it is a huge opportunity not just for FIFA to market itself, but I think more importantly for the New York/New Jersey region to market itself as the place to do business, as the place to do events and as the center for sports and entertainment in the world,\u201d Lasry said.",
      "FIFA is running the World Cup itself unlike in the past, when a local organizing committee was in charge of logistics. FIFA did not respond to a request for FIFA president Gianni Infantino and Heimo Schirgi, chief operating officer of the tournament, to discuss the World Cup.",
      "The host committee will coordinate with federal, state and local governments.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to really be handling what goes on inside the stadium,\u201d Lasry said. \u201cThe soccer match, that's going to be a lot of FIFA. We\u2019re going to be working with FIFA on security and our day-to-day responsibilities are to raise money to help put on the fan fests, to make sure that our security and transportation are all set and then also making sure that we\u2019re engaging with the communities to kind of explain to everyone what the benefits of this are going to be.\u201d",
      "Lasry, the U.S. Commerce Department's deputy assistant secretary for travel and tourism for two years until last month, said the committee will work to ensure the tournament leaves a legacy.",
      "World Cup USA 1994, which ran the previous World Cup in the U.S. for FIFA, transferred about $50 million in surplus money from the tournament to a newly established U.S Soccer Foundation, which has focused on funding the game in underserved communities.",
      "FIFA has various tiers of sponsors and Lasry said the host committee will work with FIFA's partners and be responsible deals with regional entities.",
      "Lasry said the semifinals and championship of the first expanded Club World Cup at East Rutherford's MetLife Stadium this July will be a dry run for the 2026 event.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to look at it from a security and transportation standpoint on, OK, where did things go really well? Where do we have some gaps? What went well but that we can do better?\u201d Lasry said.",

      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",

      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the audio clip \u201crecords the suspected acoustic signature of the Titan submersible implosion\u201d on June 18, 2023, the day the submersible went missing.",
      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",

      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",
      "On the eve of the AI Summit, Macron posted a series of 'deepfake' videos of himself on Instagram, using artificial intelligence to manipulate his voice and image in various parodies\u2014an effort he said was meant to spark debate on AI\u2019s potential and risks.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun expressed opposition Monday to any moves to restrict access to AI tools. The release of DeepSeek has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe oppose drawing ideological lines and oppose overstretching national security concepts and politicizing economic and trade issues,\u201d Guo said.",
      "He said that China advocates for open-source AI technology and promotes the accessibility of AI services to share the benefits of artificial intelligence with all countries.",
      "Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.\u201d",
      "Macron will also travel on Wednesday with Modi to the southern French port city of Marseille to inaugurate an Indian Consulate there and visit the ITER nuclear research site.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "Scientists are continuing to monitor the ongoing seismic swarm of undersea quakes \u2013 as strong as magnitude 5.2 \u2013 that are mostly affecting Santorini and three nearby islands, where schools have also closed and more limited emergency measures were taken.",
      "Mitsotakis visited Santorini a day after the government declared a state of emergency to allow authorities to have faster access to state resources. Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents, tourists and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry. Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead to a more powerful earthquake.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 18:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge says he will continue to pause the Trump administration's federal employee buyout offer until he issues a ruling on a preliminary injunction.",
    "story": [
      "A DOJ lawyer called the buyout offer a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees.",
      "A federal judge in Boston said he denied the request to block the buyout offer because the federal unions who brought the case lacked standing to sue and because the District Court lacks jurisdiction to review the case.",
      "Three federal employee unions -- with the support of 20 Democratic attorneys general -- have argued in a lawsuit that the Office of Personnel Management's deferred resignation offer is an \"unlawful ultimatum\" to force the resignation of government workers under the \"threat of mass termination.\"",
      "According to U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., the federal unions who challenged the policy are not directly impacted by the buyout offer; rather they are subject to collateral impacts such as a reduction in union membership and needing to answer their members' questions about the policy.",
      "\"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees. This is not sufficient,\" the judge wrote.",
      "The judge also determined that the district court lacks jurisdiction to review the dispute because the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute sets out an administrative review process before courts can take over.",
      "\"According to this complex scheme, disputes must first be administratively exhausted before the employing agency and the relevant administrative review board and any further challenges are properly heard in a court of appeals,\" the order said.",
      "O'Toole Jr. did not include any interpretation about how the buyout deadline is impacted in his order.",
      "\"This Boston Buyout Ruling is the first of many legal wins for the President. The Court dissolved the injunction due to a lack of standing. This goes to show that lawfare will not ultimately prevail over the will of 77 million Americans who supported President Trump and his priorities,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "During an hour-long hearing Monday, a lawyer for the Department of Justice framed the deferred resignation offer as a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees before President Donald Trump enacts sweeping changes to \"rebalance and reorganize the federal workforce.\"",
      "\"President Trump campaigned on a promise to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton said, outlining Trump's plan to reduce the size of the federal government and his return-to-office executive order. \"We understand these announcements may have come as a disappointment for some in the federal workforce.\"",
      "Hamilton argued that any further delay of the buyout would cause irreparable harm because the Trump administration plans to enact the next steps of reshaping the federal government as soon as the buyout window closes.",
      "Elena Goldstein, a lawyer representing the unions that brought the challenge, hammered the Trump administration for attempting to enforce an \"unprecedented program\" with a \"slapdash exploding deadline\"",
      "\"For the last two weeks, confusion has rained for millions of career civil servants,\" Goldstein said. \"This is a program of unprecedented magnitude that raises questions about the rationality of OPM's decision-making.\"",
      "The buyout offer, part of Trump's effort to trim the size of government through billionaire Elon Musk's newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, was sent out two weeks ago in an email with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" -- the same language Musk used when he slashed jobs at Twitter after taking over that company in 2022.",
      "The offer from the Office of Personnel Management offered full pay and benefits until September for any federal employee who accepted a deferred resignation by Feb. 6, with no obligation to work after they accepted the agreement.",
      "While Goldstein acknowledged that Trump has the right to downsize the federal government, she emphasized that OPM has not gone through any of the steps necessary to carry out such a sweeping move -- including analyzing the cost and benefits of their approach, evaluating its impact on the government's function, and accessing potential conflicts of interest for Musk. She added that the exact terms of the buyout are \"shifting\" for thousands of employees who have gotten inconsistent guidance from their agency.",
      "\"OPM appears to be making this up as they are going along,\" she said. \"When the government wants to decide, there are ways to do this correctly ... none of that happened here in the two weeks since they enacted this program.\"",
      "Arguing for the government, Hamilton criticized the plaintiffs' argument as \"legally incoherent and at odds with their theory of the case,\" because a further delay of the buyout would \"insert more uncertainty\" into the lives of federal employees.",
      "While the plaintiffs raised concerns that the buyout program violates federal law by using money that Congress never appropriated, Hamilton attempted to push back on the claim that the buyout changes the government's financial obligations.",
      "\"Nothing about the voluntary resignation changes anything about the federal government's financial obligations. It just changes what employees are expected to do and not do during their period of employment,\" Hamilton said.",
      "Goldstein argued that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent what she said was an unlawful offer to reshape the federal government while the Trump administration continues to \"put additional pressure on employees.\"",
      "\"This is an unprecedented action taken on an unprecedented timeline,\" she said.",
      "Just hours ahead of Thursday's original deadline for employees to accept the offer, Judge O'Toole -- who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton -- temporarily blocked the offer until Monday so he could consider issuing a temporary restraining offer pausing the order.",
      "\"I enjoined the defendants from taking any action to implement the so-called 'Fork Directive' pending the completion of briefing and oral argument on the issues,\" Judge O'Toole said in his ruling. \"I believe that's as far as I want to go today.\"",
      "The Trump administration, in response, \"extended\" the deadline for the offer, which more than 65,000 federal employees have already taken.",
      "The unions who brought the lawsuit argued that Trump exceeded his authority as president with the offer, which they described as a \"slapdash resignation program.\"",
      "According to the plaintiffs, Trump's offer violates federal law, lacks congressionally appropriated funding, and does not offer employees reassurance that the president would follow through with the offer. Their claim in part relies on a federal law from the 1940s called the Administrative Procedure Act that governs how federal agencies create and enforce rules.",
      "\"In the tech universe, 'move fast and break things' is a fine motto in part because they're not playing with the public's money, and it's expected that most initiatives are going to fail,\" Loyola Marymount law professor Justin Leavitt told ABC News. \"Congress knows that, so in 1946 they basically said, 'When agencies do stuff ... they have to be careful about it. They've got to consider all aspects of the problem.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that the buyout is unlawful because it relies on funding that Congress has yet to appropriate, violating the Antideficiency Act.",
      "\"Defendants' ultimatum divides federal workers into two groups: (1) those who submit their resignations to OPM for a promised period of pay without the requirement to work, and (2) those who have not and are therefore subject to threat of mass termination,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government have pushed back on those claims, arguing that Trump has the legal authority to provide the buyout for employees within the federal branch, and that any further delay would do more harm than good.",
      "\"Extending the deadline for the acceptance of deferred resignation on its very last day will markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the Administration's efforts to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Joshua E.

      "Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them",
      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",
      "The Arizona lawsuit does not cover the nearly 10,000 people incarcerated in private prisons for state convictions."

      "A coalition of nonprofit aid groups said Wednesday at an emergency hearing that the Trump administration's \"opaque and chaotic\" 90-day pause on foreign aid had already \"devastated\" their operations -- consequences they said justified a judicial order halting the administration's sweeping executive order.",
      "The aid groups filed suit Tuesday against President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Acting USAID Administrator Peter Marocco, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, the State Department, USAID, and OMB.",
      "Stephen Wirth, an attorney representing the nonprofits, argued at Wednesday's hearing that his clients' \"businesses are shuttering\" while the administration sifts through its foreign aid priorities.",
      "\"Food is rotting,\" Wirth said. \"Medical supplies are expiring and community relationships that took decades to build are crumbling.\"",
      "Wirth and his co-counsel noted that the payment portal for government contracts and grants is \"completely frozen,\" preventing groups from completing projects that have already been appropriated funds.",
      "Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department attorney, replied by arguing that the nonprofits' lawsuit amounts to a \"one-size-fits-all vehicle to litigate highly fact-dependent issues,\" and that it should instead be addressed \"case by case, contract by contract,\" in contrast to the broad relief the plaintiffs are seeking.",
      "Hamilton said waivers that have been put in place to rescue programs deemed to be critical to the \"national interest\" are sufficient to allow the 90-day pause to continue unimpeded -- even through he acknowledged that \"there might be some hiccups in implementing\" the waivers.",
      "\"The policy we're talking about is just a 90-day pause in funding,\" Hamilton argued.",
      "But Nicolas Sansone, an attorney for Public Citizen, another group suing the government, said some of the aid groups \"may well not be able to survive the 90 days.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, the Biden-era appointee who convened the emergency telephone hearing, said he would issue a written ruling at some point in the future and asked that plaintiffs file a \"more tailored\" proposed order by 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "The aid groups accuse several U.S. government entities, including the president and secretary of state, of breaking multiple federal laws and violating the Constitution by failing to administer funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "The groups claimed on Wednesday morning that contract terminations from the administration had \"accelerated\" in the 24 hours since they filed their lawsuits, and asked Judge Ali to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent further actions from the administration.",

      "The eight IGs claim Trump broke the law when he attempted to terminate them.",
      "Eight inspectors general who were fired by President Donald Trump last month are suing the federal government over what they allege are \"unlawful and unjustified purported termination[s].\"",
      "The eight inspectors general claimed Trump broke the law when he attempted to terminate them without justifying their removal or giving Congress 30-day notices.",
      "\"The purported firings violated unambiguous federal statutes -- each enacted by bipartisan majorities in Congress and signed into law by the President -- to protect Inspectors General from precisely this sort of interference with the discharge of their critical, non-partisan oversight duties,\" they said in the lawsuit.",
      "In an interview with ABC News' Rachel Scott, Robert Storch, the Defense Department inspector general and one of the eight plaintiffs in the new lawsuit against the administration, said people \"should be concerned that the very valuable system of independent, nonpartisan oversight\" is \"being threatened\" by efforts to remove the watchdogs from office without properly notifying Congress.",
      "\"The process ensures that if a president wants to dismiss an inspector general ... that Congress, and through it the American people, understands why the president wants to do that,\" he said, adding that it sends a \"horrible message\" to the public.",
      "Trump attempted to fire 17 inspectors general during his first week in office, sending a two-sentence email to each of the independent watchdogs. The eight inspectors general who brought the lawsuit, from the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Agriculture, Education and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration, were responsible for overseeing a combined $5 trillion in appropriated funds and 3.5 million federal employees, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Firing 18 now, regrettably 19 after the [firing of the USAID inspector general] last night, sends a message that that this sort of independent oversight is something that's not desired when, in fact, it's incredibly important for the American people,\" Storch said.",
      "The lawsuit said that because Trump allegedly failed to take the necessary steps to terminate the employees, the terminations are \"legal nullities\" and the inspectors general technically continue to serve in their lawfully appointed roles. The plaintiffs called out the Trump administration for revoking the officials' access to their computers and government-issued phones and their ability to enter their government buildings.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The inspectors general are asking a federal court in Washington, D.C., to declare that their purported terminations are \"legally ineffective,\" enjoin the Trump administration from preventing them from doing their jobs and affirm that they continue to serve in their roles until the Trump administration follows the legal avenue to remove them.",
      "Before Storch's confirmation to serve at the Pentagon under President Joe Biden, where his office investigated Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's secret hospitalization and tracked the shipment of U.S. weapons to Ukraine, he served as inspector general at the National Security Agency -- a position to which he was nominated by Trump.",
      "\"Administrations are entitled to whatever priorities they want to have. Elections have consequences,\" he said. \"Our job is to do independent, nonpartisan oversight that, whatever their priorities are, improves the economy, the effiiciency, the effectiveness and that ferrets out waste, fraud and abuse. ... That's really a complicated job.\"",

In the Obama administration, we did say we weren't interested in those people because we didn't think the resources we spent were worth the value they provided from public safety.\"",

      "With Trump's aggressive approach, there are now more than two dozen religious groups suing the Trump administration due to a policy change that allows ICE agents to make arrests in churches.",
      "The lawsuit challenges the administration's decision to reverse the Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy that prohibited enforcement actions in sensitive locations such as churches, schools, day care centers, and hospitals. The administration argued that these places were being used to conceal criminals.",
      "Sandweg explains that it is rare for ICE to enter a school or church to assert authority; frankly, they do not enjoy doing this, according to Sandweg.",
      "\"Even in this Trump administration, it will be exceedingly rare for ICE to go into a school, church, or hospital,\" Sandweg said. \"I think a lot of this is the administration eliminated this policy for a political message. ICE agents and the operators who are actually doing this work don't have a lot of interest on going to those sensitive locations.\"",
      "Sandweg said that the Trump administration is attempting to convey a message to criminals that ICE is present everywhere. One of the administration's goals is self-deportation; they aim to instill fear in undocumented migrants, making them believe there will be no safe place to hide.",
      "\"Just as much as this is about helping ICE make arrests, a lot of this, I think, is trying to persuade migrants who are in this country unlawfully to leave the country voluntarily.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was \"very important to get rid of.\"",
    "story": [
      "Over 190 House and Senate Democrats joined a letter vowing to protect CFPB",
      "A group of 191 House and Senate Democrats sent a letter to Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, calling on them to reverse course on actions targeting the nation's consumer financial watchdog agency.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices. It has been brought to a virtual standstill after Vought, who last week was named the agency's acting director, and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency took control of the agency. Vought has since issued a stop-work order to nearly all CFPB staff.",
      "Democrats, in their letter, are calling for Musk's DOGE employees, some of whom physically accessed the agency's federal office and requested access to its industry and consumer data, to be pulled out of the CFPB.",
      "\"Your efforts to dismantle the CFPB are dangerous, and we will fight them at every turn. We ask that you remove Mr. Musk's operatives from the CFPB, restore all internal and external systems and operations, and allow the CFPB to continue to do its job of protecting American consumers,\" the Democrats wrote in their letter.",
      "The letter is signed by all Senate Democrats and the two independents -- Sen. Angus King, of Maine, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont -- who caucus with them.",
      "During remarks on Monday from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said the CFPB was \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",

      "\"I would say yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said.",

      "\"The Trump Administration has effectively fired the financial cop on the beat and declared open season for predatory lenders and scam artists working to steal Americans' money and threaten their financial security,\" Democrats said in the letter.",
      "\"No matter how badly someone has been cheated and no matter how extensive the scam, the Administration has declared that the financial cops should simply stand by and watch while giant networks of lenders cheat American consumers,\" the letter continued. \"This is particularly costly for people whose claims of illegal foreclosures, car repossessions, or debanking are currently under investigation by the agency.\"",
      "The letter comes as congressional Democrats, who are in the minority in both the House and the Senate, have vowed to use their limited tools to challenge what they say is illegal overreach by the Trump administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency across a number of agencies, including USAID, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Institutes of Health and the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union filed two lawsuits this week against Vought, challenging both the takeover of the CFPB and DOGE's access to its records.",
      "The letter is led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and helped create the CFPB after the 2008 financial crash. In the days since Elon Musk posted \"RIP CFPB\" on X, Warren has been a vocal defender of the agency.",
      "Since it was established in 2011, the CFPB says it has clawed back nearly $21 billion for American consumers, addressing complaints over everything from bank fees to credit cards to student loans.",
      "On Tuesday, Warren implored Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who was appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, to work with Congress to keep Musk's team out of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "\"If the CFPB is not there examining these giant banks to make sure they are following the laws, are not cheating consumers, who is doing that job?\" Warren asked Powell during the hearing.",
      "\"I can say no other federal regulators,\" Powell replied.",
      "\"No one. In other words thanks to 'co-president' Musk and the CFPB Acting Director Vought, Wall Street banks no longer have to show the bank examiners that they're not illegally opening accounts people didn't ask for, like what happened with Wells Fargo, or charging illegal junk fees like Bank of America did,\" Warren said.",
      "But some Republicans on the panel pushed back on this line of questioning, saying laws that regulate banks haven't changed and Elon Musk is simply carrying out the work Trump promised on the campaign.",

Katie Britt. \"I think it's important to remember that President Trump ran on this. I mean, he said we're going to look for wasteful spending across our government.\"",

      "What they heard was that President Donald Trump is intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine, including a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops. Hegseth said the force should not have Article Five protections, which could require the U.S. or the 31 other nations of the NATO alliance to come to the aid of those forces if they end up in contact with Russian forces.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s stark message, and his insistence that Russia should keep some territory that Ukraine wants back, is likely to complicate talks later this week between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other senior American officials at a major security security conference in Munich.",
      "\u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d Hegseth said, as Kyiv\u2019s backers gathered at NATO headquarters for a meeting to drum up more arms and ammunition for the war, which will soon enter its fourth year.",
      "All 32 allies must agree for a country to join NATO, meaning that every member has a veto.",
      "\u201cInstead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Hegseth insisted that NATO should play no role in any future military mission to police the peace in Ukraine and that any peacekeeping troops should not be covered by the part of NATO\u2019s founding treaty that obliges all allies to come to the aid of any member under attack.",
      "Article Five has been activated only once, when European allies and Canada used the collective security guarantee to help the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on New York and Washington.",
      "Hegseth also said Europe \"must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine currently relies equally on Europe and the U.S. for about 30% each of its defense needs. The rest is produced by Ukraine itself.",
      "Addressing the allies of Ukraine known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, he also insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western backers must abandon the \u201cillusionary goal\u201d of returning the country to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and seized parts of eastern Ukraine.",
      "\u201cMembers of this contact group must meet the moment,\u201d Hegseth said to the approximately 50 member countries that have provided support to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe hear you,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Both Hegseth and Healey spoke in front of journalists at the top of a closed-door session in Brussels to discuss future aid to Ukraine.",
      "Over nearly three years, those 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as the chair of the group since its creation.",
      "But the meeting this week was convened by the United Kingdom, and no decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn\u2019t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won\u2019t stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "Trump has promised to end the war quickly. He\u2019s complained that it\u2019s costing American taxpayers too much money and suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Hegseth in his remarks said that NATO member nations also need to significantly increase defense spending to 5% of their budgets \u2014 a high mark that the U.S. does not presently meet either.",
      "\u201cThe United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependence. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security,\" Hegseth said.",
      "European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 of them are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product, but a third still fall short.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to Ukraine.",
      "Before Hegseth spoke, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told The Associated Press that Putin will only negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine if its backers continue to provide enough weapons and ammunition.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure that he has no other option, and that means to force him to the table,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cHe needs to understand that we will not give up on Ukraine. We have to make sure that we have maximum economic impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's remarks come a day after American history teacher Marc Vogel returned safely to the U.S. after three years in a Russian prison. The White House suggested that his release could help to advance negotiations on ending the war.",
      "Trump said another American, someone \u201cvery special,\u201d would be released Wednesday, though he declined to name the person or say from what country. The president did not say what the United States exchanged for Fogel\u2019s release.",

      "\"I've worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods of my career,\" CEO Damon Hininger said Tuesday on the company's earnings call. \"We anticipate significant growth opportunities, perhaps the most significant growth in our company's history over the next several years.\"",
      "\"The change in presidential administration on Jan. 20 has ushered in significant policy and legislative changes that directly impact our business,\" Hininger said on the public call, which comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased its apprehensions of people alleged to be in the country illegally.",
      "Hininger told shareholders that the company is taking proactive steps to prepare facilities and beds in anticipation of potential new contracts with ICE.",
      "CoreCivic executives on the call said they currently speak almost \"hourly\" with ICE officials and with members of the administration, and have \"active tours going on\" at their facilities.",
      "\"We've got a proposal in front of ICE for 28,000 beds,\" one executive said, adding that the offer could result in more than a billion dollars in revenue for the company.",
      "The 28,000 beds offered to ICE comes from vacant facilities that are not currently activated, as well as from availability in existing facilities and from the South Texas Family Residential Center, the nation's largest migrant detention center that was closed in 2024, executives said.",
      "ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "In response to questions about the administration's decision to use Guantanamo Bay and a prison in El Salvador to hold migrant detainees, executives for CoreCivic said they believe their facilities are \"superior\" to the alternatives when it comes to cost and logistics.",

      "The CoreCivic CEO also said he believes the company's facilities are less likely to face litigation, and said they are \"more humane than the other alternatives.\"",
      "\"We're feeling very encouraged by the conversations with ICE to date,\" Hininger said. \"We've got a lot of activity going on in the organization, a lot of opportunities, so it's a very exciting time within the company.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 12:08:21 -0500",
    "summary": "The filings also provided new insights into DOGE's ongoing mission with the Treasury Department.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Department officials said the \"error\" was quickly corrected.",
      "A 25-year-old associate of Elon Musk and former Treasury Department employee was \"mistakenly\" given the ability to make changes to a sensitive federal payment system, officials with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service disclosed in a series of court filings late Tuesday.",
      "Treasury Department officials said the \"error\" was quickly corrected, and a forensic investigation into the actions of Marko Elez -- who resigned from his position last week after The Wall Street Journal unearthed a series of racist social media posts -- remains ongoing.",
      "\"To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Elez never knew of the fact that he briefly had read/write permissions for the [Secure Payment System] database, and never took any action to exercise the 'write' privileges in order to modify anything within the SPS database -- indeed, he never logged in during the time that he had read/write privileges, other than during the virtual walk-through -- and forensic analysis is currently underway to confirm this,\" wrote Joseph Gioeli III, a deputy commissioner at Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The high-profile mistake at BFS -- which effectively serves as the federal government's checkbook by disbursing more than $5 trillion annually -- comes as a federal judge in New York is weighing whether to continue to block individuals associated with Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice initially insisted that Elez was strictly given \"read-only\" access to sensitive records, but the affidavits submitted by BFS employees on Tuesday noted that the 25-year-old was inadvertently given the ability to \"read/write\" the sensitive system that agencies use to send \"large dollar amount transactions\" to the Treasury Department.",
      "According to Gioeli, Treasury Department officials also provided Elez with copies of the \"source code\" for multiple payment systems that he could edit in a digital \"sandbox.\"",
      "\"Mr. Elez could review and make changes locally to copies of the source code in the cordoned-off code repository; however, he did not have the authority or capability to publish any code changes to the production system or underlying test environments,\" the filing said.",
      "Elez resigned from his role on Feb. 6, and Gioielli claimed that the 25-year-old former SpaceX and X employee was the \"only individual on the Treasury DOGE Team\" who was given direct access to payment systems or source code. A \"preliminary review\" of his digital activity suggests that Elez stayed within the permitted bounds of his role when accessing the payment systems.",
      "\"While forensic analysis is still ongoing, Bureau personnel have conducted preliminary reviews of logs of his activity both on his laptop and within the systems and at this time have found no indication of any unauthorized use, of any use outside the scope that was directed by Treasury leadership, or that Mr. Elez used his BFS laptop to share any BFS payment systems data outside the U.S. Government,\" the filing said.",
      "The filings also provided new insights into DOGE's ongoing mission with the Treasury Department, including to identify fraud, better understand how the payments are fulfilled and to enforce Trump's day-one executive order that significantly cut foreign aid.",
      "According to Thomas Krause -- a tech CEO and DOGE volunteer who is leading the cost-cutting effort at the Treasury Department -- DOGE is engaged in 4-to-6-week assessment of the Treasury Department's payment systems. He was placed at Treasury not only to identify potential fraud but also understand how to use the Department's payment systems to potentially cut funding to other parts of the government, the filing said.",
      "\"BFS is well positioned to help agencies and the federal government holistically understand and take stock of the problems [Government Accountability Office] has reported on,\" Krause wrote.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:19:07 -0500",
    "summary": "\"The bloodshed must stop and this war must end,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.",
    "story": [
      "Hegseth said the U.S. won't send troops to enforce any peace deal with Russia.",
      "LONDON and THE PENTAGON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared at his first meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday to tell allies that the liberation of all Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory \"is an unrealistic objective.\"",
      "\"The bloodshed must stop and this war must end,\" Hegseth said, in one of the most detailed delineations of the Ukraine-Russia peace deal envisioned by President Donald Trump's new administration.",
      "\"President Trump has been clear with the American people -- and with many of your leaders -- that stopping the fighting and reaching an enduring peace is a top priority,\" Hegseth said at the meeting, which was led by the U.K., marking the first time the group has not convened under U.S. leadership.",
      "\"He intends to end this war by diplomacy and bringing both Russia and Ukraine to the table,\" Hegseth said. \"We will only end this devastating war and establish a durable peace by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield.\"",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government in Kyiv have demanded full territorial liberation -- whether by military or diplomatic means -- per the country's internationally-recognized 1991 borders. Among Ukraine's other demands are binding Western security guarantees, ideally in the form of full NATO membership and Article Five protection.",
      "Hegseth rejected such ambitions, at least in the near term.",
      "\"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\" he told allies. \"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "\"The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth continued. \"Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "\"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and they should not be covered under Article Five,\" he added. \"There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact.\"",
      "\"To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly vowed to end the war by forcing both Moscow and Kyiv back to the negotiating table after nearly three years of full-scale war.",
      "Hegseth suggested that Trump's domestic energy policies would help pressure the Kremlin. \"Lower energy prices coupled with more effective enforcement of energy sanctions will help bring Russia to the table,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth delivered a broader warning to European allies of a lighter U.S. footprint on the continent. They, he said, will need to \"provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.\"",
      "He said the \"stark strategic realities\" of competition with China in the Indo-Pacific and the U.S. focus on securing its domestic borders \"prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.\"",
      "Hegseth called on allies to donate more ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, expand their industrial bases and explain to citizens that the Russian threat necessitates \"spending more on defense and investing strategically.\"",
      "That will include increasing defense spending beyond the 2% of GDP target agreed by allies in 2014. The threshold -- which many NATO allies have still not achieved -- \"is not enough,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"President Trump has called for 5% and I agree,\" he added. \"Increasing your commitment to your own security is a down payment for the future.\"",
      "The defense secretary warned that while the U.S. \"remains committed to the NATO alliance and to partnership with Europe,\" America \"will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.\"",
      "\"Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security,\" he added. \"Honesty will be our policy going forward.\"",
      "In response to Hegseth's remarks, British Defense Secretary John Healey said, \"We hear you.\"",
      "\"We hear your commitment to NATO, to Article Five, to a sovereign Ukraine and to your defense partnership with Europe,\" Healey said. \"We also hear your concerns.\"",
      "\"On stepping up for Ukraine, we are and we will,\" Healey continued. \"On stepping up for European security, we are and we will.\"",
      "\"You've just spoken about peace through strength,\" Healey said. \"We are 50 nations strong here, all determined to put an end to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war, to do so together.\"",

      "In his own words, author Salman Rushdie describes the moments when a stranger rushed at him on stage in western New York and began attacking him",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- Author Salman Rushdie testified Tuesday in the trial of a man accused of attacking him with a knife just after he took his seat for a panel discussion at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York.",
      "The noted author was on the witness stand for just about an hour, during which he described the 2022 assault in front of a shocked audience in precise detail. He also told some jokes with the comfort of someone experienced at public speaking.",
      "The man accused in the attack, Hadi Matar, was grabbed by bystanders and arrested. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Following are highlights of Rushdie's testimony:",
      "\u201cBefore we were able to start having the conversation we were going to have, I was aware of this person rushing at me from my righthand side,\" Rushdie said. \u201cI only saw him at the last minute. I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInitially he hit me very hard,\u201d Rushdie said. \u201cI thought he was hitting me with his fist, but I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes. He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was struggling to get away from him and I was struck a number of times more on my chest and torso and around my waist,\u201d the author said. \"I was trying to get to my feet, out of the chair, and get away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen there were a number of blows to my chest and torso. Three stab wounds down the center of my chest,\u201d he said, adding there were also injuries to his waist area. While lying on the stage, Rushdie recalled \u201ca sense of great pain and shock and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.\"",
      "\u201cIt was a stab wound in my eye and intensely painful, and after that, I was screaming because of the pain and I couldn\u2019t see out of the eye any more,\" Rushdie said.",
      "\u201cIt occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\u201d",
      "Defense lawyer Lynn Shaffer got a chance to question Rushdie about the attack.",
      "\u201cI believe you said you are a writer,\u201d she began.",
      "Later she asked Rushdie if he\u2019d be surprised that \u2019Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d in which he makes a cameo, was her favorite movie.",
      "\u201cI am surprised,\u201d Rushdie said, joking that it was \u201cmy most important work.\u201d",
      "The only hint at a possible defense strategy was a question about whether trauma can affect memories.",
      "Rushdie acknowledged that he has a false memory, that he thought he stood up when he saw the attacker approaching, but that wasn\u2019t true.",
      "She then challenged him to remember how many times he was struck.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting at the time. I was otherwise occupied but afterward I could see them on my body. I didn\u2019t need to be told by anybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m not quite at 100%. I think I\u2019ve substantially recovered but it\u2019s probably 75-80%,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m not as energetic as I used to be. I\u2019m not as physically strong as I used to be.\u201d"

      "A judge has ordered Louisiana State University to fully reinstate a professor who was removed from his teaching duties last month after he used vulgar language to criticize Gov. Jeff Landry and President Donald Trump during a lecture",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A judge has ordered Louisiana State University to fully reinstate a professor who was removed from his teaching duties last month after he used vulgar language to criticize Gov. Jeff Landry and President Donald Trump during a lecture.",
      "The ruling, which allows tenured law professor Ken Levy to return to his classroom this week, was issued following the conclusion of Tuesday's hearing over a lawsuit Levy filed against the university. During two days of testimony, law students and another professor spoke about the \u201cchilling effect\u201d Levy's removal had on them and that it exacerbated fears over speaking freely in the classroom.",
      "\u201cEveryone was vulnerable if I lost this,\u201d Levy said outside of the Baton Rouge courthouse Tuesday night, specifically speaking about other university faculty members and students. \u201cSo my win is their win.\u201d",
      "The legal battle stems from an anonymous student complaint pertaining to what the professor said on the first day of a criminal justice course in January.",
      "A transcript of a recording taken in the class, shared in court and published by The Advocate, showed that Levy said \u201cf(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) the governor\u201d as well as told students he could put them in jail if they broke his no-recording policy. Levy said that the comments were made in a \u201cjoking manner\u201d and multiple students who testified also interpreted it as humor.",
      "Additionally, Levy \u2014 who told students he was a Democrat \u2014 used the expletive to talk about Trump, referring to the November presidential election and saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)r won.\u201d",
      "Within a few days, university administration informed Levy he had been relieved from his teaching responsibilities \u201cpending an investigation into student complaints of inappropriate statements made in your class,\u201d according to Levy's lawsuit.",
      "Levy's attorney, Jill Craft, said that the professor's removal violated his academic freedom and lacked his right to due process. Jimmy Faircloth, Jr., an attorney representing the university, argued that initial findings showed Levy had created a classroom environment that could be demeaning to some students, specifically those who don't share the same political views as the professor. Faircloth also said that the lawsuit was premature, as Levy was only removed from his classroom \u2014 but still being paid and allowed to be on campus \u2014 as a full investigation continued.",
      "In his ruling from the bench on Tuesday night, 19th Judicial District Judge Tarvald Smith said he saw no problem with Levy's vulgarity under the context presented and that negative comments about politicians are \u201ca way of life.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Smith said he hopes the state-funded university will allow professors to \u201cinvite rigorous debate and dialogue\u201d to prepare law students who are going into a career field where they will face opposing opinions every day.",
      "\u201cYour client should get back to the business of training lawyers and let professors teach,\u201d Smith told Faircloth.",
      "Throughout the hearing, one name repeatedly mentioned was Gov. Landry, a Republican and ally of Trump's. Since taking office last year, Landry has made national news for his sweeping conservative agenda, which includes a law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in every public classroom, a Texas-style immigration measure, expansion of death row execution methods and a measure classifying abortion pills as dangerous controlled substances.",
      "Last November, Landry publicly called on Louisiana State University to discipline another law professor, Nicholas Bryner, who during a lecture criticized Trump and students who voted for him. Bryner remains employed by the school. Levy cited that particular situation as a reason for his no-recording policy in class.",
      "In Levy's case, Landry also took to X, saying the professor's conduct \u201cshould not be tolerated.\u201d Levy testified that he received death threats following the governor's post.",
      "Landry\u2019s office did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "While it has been questioned by some residents, students and Levy's attorney if the governor played any role in the professor\u2019s removal, Faircloth said that is \u201ca conspiratorial narrative\u201d and there was \u201cno political motivation.\u201d",
      "University President William Tate IV testified on Tuesday, that it was solely his decision to remove Levy, adding that he \u201cnever talked to the governor about this matter.\u201d Tate said he reviewed a transcript of what Levy said and felt the \u201ctotality of it was over the line of what I would expect to see in a classroom.\u201d",
      "Other\u2019s continue to have worries that their lectures may be scrutinized, especially if they oppose the views of a sitting elected official. Among those with trepidation is Professor Patrick Martin IV, who teaches jurisprudence and says he may discuss Louisiana's new embattled Ten Commandments requirement.",
      "\u201cIs it possible I\u2019m going to be suspended?,\" Martin asked in court. \"That\u2019s a real fear.\u201d"

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Donald Trump has nominated a longtime oil and gas industry representative to oversee an agency that manages a quarter-billion acres of public land concentrated in western states.",
      "Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Colorado-based oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance, was named Bureau of Land Management director, a position with wide influence over lands used for energy production, grazing, recreation and other purposes. An MIT graduate, Sgamma has been a leading voice for the fossil fuel industry, calling for fewer drilling restrictions on public lands that produce about 10% of U.S. oil and gas.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, she would be a key architect of Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d agenda alongside Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who leads the newly formed National Energy Council that Trump says will establish American \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world. Trump has vowed to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on climate change.",
      "Former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt relocated the land bureau's headquarters to Colorado during Trump\u2019s first term, leading to a spike in employee resignations. The bureau went four years under Trump without a confirmed director.",
      "The headquarters for the 10,000-person agency was moved back to Washington, D.C. under Biden, who installed Montana conservationist Traci Stone-Manning at the bureau to lead his administration's efforts to curb oil and gas production in the name of fighting climate change.",
      "Sgamma will be charged with reversing those policies, by putting into effect a series of orders issued last week by Burgum as part of Trump's plan to sharply expand fossil fuel production.",
      "Burgum ordered reviews of many of Stone-Manning's signature efforts, including fewer oil and gas lease sales, an end to coal leasing in the nation's biggest coal fields, a greater emphasis on conservation and drilling and renewable energy restrictions meant to protect a wide-ranging Western bird, the greater sage grouse. Burgum also ordered federal officials to review and c onsider redrawing the boundaries of national monuments that were created under Biden and other presidents to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources.",
      "Sgamma said on social media she was honored to be nominated.",
      "She said she greatly respects the agency's work to balance multiple uses for public lands \u2014 including energy, recreation, grazing and mining \u2014 with stewardship of the land. \"I look forward to leading an agency that is key to the agenda of unleashing American energy while protecting the environment,\" she wrote on LinkedIn.",
      "But environmentalists warned that Sgamma would elevate corporate interests over protections for public land.",
      "\u201cKathleen Sgamma would be an unmitigated disaster for our public lands,\u201d said Taylor McKinnon at the Center for Biological Diversity, adding that Sgamma has \u201cbreathtaking disdain for environmental laws, endangered species, recreation, or anything other than industry profit.\u201d",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said Sgamma's nomination was an \u201cexcellent choice.\u201d",

      "Nesvik until last year led the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, where he pushed to remove federal protections for grizzly bears. That would open the door to public hunting for the first time in decades after the animals bounced back from near-extinction last century in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains.",

      "Lawyers sparred before New York\u2019s top court over how specific a man alleging sexual abuse decades ago needs to be in his lawsuit against the state",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Lawyers sparred before New York's top court Wednesday over how specific a man alleging sexual abuse decades ago needs to be in his lawsuit against the state in a case that's being watched by advocates concerned about the legal standards for survivors to recall traumatic events.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James' office is seeking dismissal of the lawsuit by a man who says he was repeatedly sexually assaulted around a state-run theater in Albany from 1986 to 1990, starting when he was 12. The suit was filed under a 2019 state law that allows people to sue over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.",
      "A state attorney told the Court of Appeals the lawsuit doesn\u2019t adequately specify the nature of the claimed abuse and that its time frame for when the alleged abuse happened is too broad, falling short of standards for suing the state.",
      "The case deals only with requirements for suing New York, not private institutions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a specific date, but it should be a very narrow range,\" said Jeffrey Lang of the attorney general's office. \u201cI would say weeks, and here we just have nothing.\u201d",
      "Narrower time frames are needed so the state can investigate claims and assess its liability, Lang said.",
      "James' appeal has worried some supporters of the Child Victims Act, the state law that temporarily lifted barriers to filing civil suits over child sexual abuse beyond typical time limits. They say child abuse victims cannot be expected to consistently recall details of trauma that occurred long ago.",
      "The man's lawyer echoed that argument Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAt the time this claim was filed almost four years ago, this was the extent of the information that he knew because of the psychological trauma,\u201d said attorney Seth Dymond.",
      "The man sued the state in 2021, saying he was repeatedly raped, molested and fondled by multiple men, including state employees, around The Egg, a performing arts theater at the state Capitol complex. The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly.",
      "The lawsuit originally was dismissed by a judge for the Court of Claims who cited the lack of specific dates. A mid-level appeals court reversed that decision in November 2023. The appeals judges found that the since the alleged events occurred several decades ago when the claimant was a child, the multi-year timeframe was specific enough.",
      "The case is among roughly 300 filed against the state during a two-year window under the Child Victims Act. The lion\u2019s share of more than 10,800 lawsuits filed before the window closed in 2021 named private institutions such as churches, hospitals and schools.",
      "The arguments over the man's suit have highlighted tensions between James\u2019 public image as a champion for victims and her legal duty to defend the state against lawsuits.",
      "A spokesperson for the Democratic attorney general said in a prepared statement that survivors of child sexual abuse \u201cdeserve the opportunity to pursue justice through the process outlined in the Child Victims Act. As New York\u2019s lawyer, we have a responsibility to defend the state, which we are balancing with our strong desire to support survivors and their ability to heal.\u201d",
      "James argues the Legislature could have adopted different legal requirements for suing the state when it crafted the law.",
      "Advocates and attorneys for survivors have expressed concern that a win for the state could affect some pending cases filed under the Child Victims Act, as well as cases bought more recently under a companion law that opened a litigation window for people claiming they were abused as adults. The Adult Survivors Act resulted in more than 1,400 lawsuits against the state, most alleging abuse in state prisons.",
      "\u201cThe state basically is saying, \u2018We don\u2019t believe victims. We\u2019re not going to allow these victims have their day in court,\u2019\u201d said Gary Greenberg, an advocate who fought for the Child Victims Act.",
      "Albany Law School professor Dale Margolin Cecka noted that James' primary duty is to defend the state. By appealing to the top court, James is seeking resolution on the standards for suing under the Child Victims Act that are unclear, said Cecka, who represents victims of domestic violence.",
      "\u201cShe can\u2019t go, \u2018Well, this seems so bad to me that we\u2019re just not going to personally advocate for our client,\u2019 which is the state of New York,\u201d Cecka said."

      "In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services \u201csystematically engaged\u201d in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation.",
      "Citing \u201cvarious credible sources,\u201d the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 \u2014 the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising.",
      "Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured \u201cwere shot by Bangladesh\u2019s security forces,\u201d the report said.",
      "Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed \u2014- or as many as about 180 people \u2014 were children.",
      "In some cases, \u201csecurity forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,\u201d it said.",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk cited signs that \u201cextrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture\u201d were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests.",
      "The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country's interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown.",
      "The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said \u201cmany perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.\u201d",
      "The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said.",
      "While the government has changed, \u201cthe system has not necessarily changed,\" Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office's Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. \"Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,\u201d he said.",
      "Such a situation creates \u201ca potential conflict of interest\u201d and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added.",
      "The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with \u201cimminent threat of death or serious injury.\u201d",
      "What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party.",
      "A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the \u201cimmediate trigger\u201d to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said."

      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court set a March 19 execution date Tuesday for a man who pleaded guilty to murder more than 17 years ago and recently said his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d It would be the state\u2019s first application of the death penalty in more than two years.",
      "The court issued an execution warrant for Aaron Brian Gunches, who was convicted in 2007 in the 2002 shooting death of Ted Price, his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband, near the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.",
      "Gunches also shot a trooper twice when he was pulled over by the Arizona Department of Public Safety near the California border in 2003, according to authorities. A bulletproof vest saved the trooper, and bullet casings from that scene matched ones found near Price\u2019s body.",
      "In a statement, Price\u2019s sister, Karen Price, described her brother as a kind and loving person who enjoyed watching the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks and riding his motorcycle.",

      "Arizona, which has 112 prisoners on death row, last carried out three executions in 2022 following a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining drugs for execution. In one of the 2022 executions, the state was criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner.",
      "The court had issued a death warrant for Gunches nearly two years ago, but the sentence wasn\u2019t carried out because the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general agreed not to pursue executions during a review of the state\u2019s death penalty protocol. The review ended in November when Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs dismissed the retired federal magistrate judge she had appointed to examine execution procedures.",

      "The 53-year-old Gunches, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but is representing himself, had asked the court in late December to skip legal formalities and schedule his lethal injection earlier than authorities had planned, saying his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d The state Supreme Court rejected his request.",
      "There was no immediate response to phone and email messages seeking comment from Emily Skinner, an attorney who serves as Gunches\u2019 advisory counsel.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina House members advanced Wednesday a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene as committees fleshed out details on how best to spend another $500 million to address the historic flooding.",
      "The House's budget-writing committee voted for the latest spending proposal, which would emphasize repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers who lost crops and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent used by small businesses.",
      "GOP House leaders had unveiled a version last week, but several amendments adjusted the measure in a special Helene recovery committee on Tuesday. A House floor vote is expected next week, said Rep. John Bell, the House rules chairman and co-chairman of the recovery committee.",
      "The package remains less than half of the $1.07 billion that new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein sought in new recovery spending earlier this month from legislators.",
      "Stein's package contains several initiatives the House plan currently lacks, including money to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues and for two business grant programs designed to help small businesses directly.",
      "Senate GOP leaders will have their own competing spending ideas that will figure into negotiations with House counterparts. Both Stein and Republican lawmakers want to get more Helene spending out the door early this year to address immediate needs. Additional funds are expected in the two-year state budget that would take effect July 1.",

      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",

      "The Sangamon County Board approved the settlement Tuesday night, allowing taxpayers to avoid a drawn-out and likely traumatic lawsuit over the summertime shooting by former deputy Sean Grayson.",
      "The county maintains a settlement fund with a balance of $1.5 million. But according to local news reports, county administrator Brian McFadden said the rest of the payment will come from reserves in other county funds.",

      "The case has drawn national attention as another example of police shooting Black people in their homes. It forced the premature retirement of Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell, who hired Grayson, and prompted an agreement with the Justice Department for more training on non-discriminatory policing, de-escalation techniques and dealing with mental health disabilities.",
      "Massey, whose mental health issues were the subject of several 911 calls from herself and her mother in the days leading up to the shooting, called emergency responders early on July 6 to report a suspected prowler. Grayson and another deputy responded. During a conversation in her living room, Grayson noticed a pot of water on the stove and directed the other officer to remove it.",
      "Massey retrieved the pot and joked with Grayson about how he backed away from it, then told Grayson, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson yelled at her to drop the pot and drew his weapon. Massey apologized and ducked behind a counter. Grayson fired three shots, striking her just below the left eye.",
      "Grayson remains jailed despite a unanimous 4th District Appellate Court ruling in November that his pre-trial detention was improper because prosecutors failed to show there were no conditions under which Grayson could be released without posing a threat to the community. Illinois eliminated cash bail in a law that took effect in 2023, allowing judges to order detention only with sufficient cause.",
      "The Illinois Supreme Court is considering an appeal of that ruling."

    "story": [
      "Baltimore is suing Glock over design features that allow its handguns to be easily modified to become fully automatic weapons",
      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore is suing gunmaker Glock over design features that allow its handguns to be easily modified to become fully automatic weapons, which enables criminals to inflict more damage and makes the city more dangerous, attorneys argue in a complaint filed Wednesday.",
      "The lawsuit follows similar cases brought against Glock in Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey. They accuse the company of failing to protect the public by selling firearms that can be adapted with dime-sized switches to spray continuous gunfire \u2014 up to 1,200 rounds per minute \u2014 instead of firing one bullet each time the trigger is pulled.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s faster than the weapons of war that I used in the Army,\u201d Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said during a news conference Wednesday morning announcing it. \u201cATF agents call it \u2018spray and pray\u2019 because once the trigger is pulled, there\u2019s no control \u2014 only carnage.\u201d",
      "The state of Maryland joined the city of Baltimore as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.",
      "Often referred to as Glock switches or auto sears, the conversion devices can be bought for about $20 or 3D-printed. They\u2019ve received heightened attention in recent years because they\u2019re increasingly turning up at crime scenes.",
      "Glock isn\u2019t the only gunmaker whose weapons can be adapted with switches, but critics say its handguns are among the easiest to convert. With rare exceptions, federal law prohibits the sale and possession of machine guns.",
      "\u201cGlock could have designed its pistols to prevent auto sears from working. They chose not to. That choice cost lives,\u201d Brown said.",
      "Glock didn\u2019t respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment, and it hasn\u2019t responded to previous AP requests for comment on lawsuits over the switches. But a gun industry group has condemned the New Jersey and Minnesota lawsuits as frivolous claims that abuse the judicial system and disregard federal law.",
      "A report last year by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety said modified Glocks are often used in crimes. And the company has long been aware that easy conversion is a selling point, said Eric Tirschwell, executive director of Everytown Law, which represents the plaintiffs in the Maryland lawsuit.",
      "The brand is perhaps best known for its popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry Glock handguns. But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the recent proliferation of Glock switches means his officers increasingly find themselves \u201coutmatched by criminals.\u201d",
      "Baltimore police recovered 65 modified Glocks in 2024, compared to 35 the previous year, officials said. Roughly half the people arrested with modified Glocks since the beginning of 2023 were under 21 years old, according to the suit. The complaint alleges that Glock switches are adding to a culture of violence among young men across Baltimore.",
      "Filed in state court in Baltimore, the lawsuit accuses Glock of violating Maryland\u2019s public nuisance laws. It seeks an injunction preventing the sale of certain firearms in Maryland, a court order demanding safety measures and restitution payments that could contribute to anti-violence programs.",
      "The Maryland General Assembly passed a law last year allowing for civil action against members of the firearm industry who fail to meet minimum standards to prevent harm. Another bill banned the conversion devices.",
      "Baltimore leaders also sued the ghost gun manufacturer Polymer80, which agreed to stop selling its untraceable, unassembled firearms to Maryland residents under a settlement announced last year. The Nevada-based company later shut down after facing a deluge of lawsuits.",
      "Baltimore has recently experienced significant reductions in gun violence that experts attribute to robust anti-violence programs, improvements in policing and pandemic recovery, among other factors. But Mayor Brandon Scott said his administration is \u201cmobilizing every resource at our disposal\u201d to continue those positive trends, including civil litigation."

      "This week, the White House barred Associated Press journalists from three media appearances by President Donald Trump \u2014 two of them in the Oval Office itself. Some of the reaction said, effectively, this: What right do you have to be there, anyway?",
      "The answer is a combination of tradition, independent reporting and the First Amendment's guarantee of a free press.",
      "The AP, a global news outlet founded in 1846, is a source of fact-based, independent news that reaches billions of people every day. The news cooperative has been a member of the 13-person White House press pool that has reported on the president and held him accountable since its inception more than a century ago.",
      "The pool gets access to the president on the understanding that it distributes his comments and activities to other news outlets, congressional offices and more.",
      "When the Trump administration blocked the AP from two events, it didn\u2019t just bar the outlet from access to the president; it did so after an or-else demand that the news agency change its style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America,\u201d per Trump's presidential order.",
      "The AP has said that it will refer to the water as the Gulf of Mexico, while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP says it must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.",
      "Here is some background about the relationship between the presidency and the press \u2014 now and across the years.",
      "The First Amendment to the Bill of Rights states that the government \u201cshall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d To AP Executive Editor Julie Pace, Trump\u2019s move \u2014 an attempt to use a news outlet\u2019s access to him to control the content it published \u2014 is \u201ca plain violation of the First Amendment.\"",
      "\u201cThe actions taken by this White House were plainly intended to punish the AP for the content of its speech,\u201d Pace wrote Wednesday to Trump Chief of Staff Susie Wiles. \u201cIt is among the most basic tenets of the First Amendment that the government cannot retaliate against the public or the press for what they say.\u201d",
      "The White House pointed out that the AP was allowed into its briefing Wednesday but continued to take issue with the style of the gulf\u2019s name.",
      "\u201cNobody has the right to go into the Oval Office and ask the president of the United States questions,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday. \u201cWe reserve the right to decide who gets to go into the Oval Office.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the president and the press is intended to be adversarial. That's essential for knowing what the president and his administration are \u2014 or are not \u2014 doing in the United States' name with taxpayer money.",
      "Freely questioning elected lawmakers is the reason, for example, why congressional reporters can roam most of the same Capitol hallways as members of the House and Senate and pose questions on behalf of Americans. At the White House, a smaller secure compound that functions as a residence, work space and event venue, the rules of access are more strict. But it, too, belongs to Americans.",
      "\u201cThe press is there to represent readers, viewers and listeners all over the world whose lives are going to be affected by what happens in the Oval Office but who are not able to be physically present themselves,\u201d said Kathy Kiely, professor of free press studies at the Missouri School of Journalism. \u201cThe reporters ensure that the public gets information beyond the self-interested accounts provided by the president and his public relations team.\u201d",
      "The first known instance of a so-called pool reporter inside the White House was in 1881 when President James A. Garfield was shot. As the chief executive lay in bed, AP reporter Franklin Trusdell sat outside his sick room, listening to him breathe and sharing updates with other correspondents.",
      "Now, it's a group of news outlets that ideally are almost everywhere the president goes: in the Oval Office, to state dinners, on Air Force One, in the motorcade, and when the president goes golfing or biking, It was with Trump at the Super Bowl. The pool is also always on standby in case something happens in the world about which the president needs to speak to the nation.",
      "One reason the pool exists is because the Oval Office, the president's official work space, is too small to accommodate every news outlet that would want to cover his executive order signings or meetings with foreign dignitaries. So the pool operates with a representative of each medium acting as eyes and ears for the others who can\u2019t get in. When a \u201cpooled\u201d event is over, the print, television and radio poolers share written notes, video and audio with everyone else who is interested.",
      "The pool maintains strict decorum, according to the White House Correspondents' Association guidelines. It is standard practice to stand when the president enters the room. Even though shouting is \u201cunacceptable,\" presidential appearances can get rowdy.",
      "The White House press pool represents every media format and daily includes the AP and other wire-service writers, the AP and other photographers, a television crew, radio correspondent and writers for print and online publications.",
      "The pool was in John F. Kennedy\u2019s motorcade in Dallas when he was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. That allowed for firsthand accounts of the event as conspiracy theories spread, an example of why independent reporting is critical to understanding what is happening around the president.",
      "\u201cThere was a loud bang as though a giant firecracker had exploded in the cavern between the tall buildings we were just leaving behind us,\u201d AP reporter Jack Bell, who was in the motorcade with other reporters, recalled to Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cThe man in front of me screamed, \u2018My God, they\u2019re shooting at the president!\u2019\u201d",
      "George W. Bush was on camera at a school in Florida Sept. 11, 2001, when an aide whispered in his ear that America was under attack. More recently, the pool was in St. Croix on the night that former President Jimmy Carter died. The White House told the pool to stand by, and at a certain point transported the pool to a downtown hotel where then-President Joe Biden spoke about his predecessor and answered some questions.",
      "Trump is famous for courting reporters even as he publicly criticizes them. Now, legacy media is on its heels amid an atmosphere of distrust as people get news from other sources \u2014 some less credible than others.",
      "He's not the first to try to go around traditional outlets. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had his fireside chats over the radio as some of the nation's biggest newspapers took issue with government expansion under the New Deal. More recently, television and social media \u2014 and especially podcasts during the 2024 election \u2014 have provided similar workarounds for presidents.",
      "In 1798, John Adams signed the Sedition Act, which made it a crime for American citizens to \u201cprint, utter, or publish...any false, scandalous, and malicious writing\u201d about the government and used it to jail journalists, according to the National Archives.

      "The U.S. Coast Guard has been searching for tar balls that began showing up on Florida beaches over the weekend",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The U.S. Coast Guard has been searching for tar balls that began showing up on South Florida beaches over the weekend, but so far the source of the black muck remains a mystery.",
      "The agency has been investigating reports of tar balls from Port Everglades to Palm Beach along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, the Coast Guard said in a statement.",
      "Some beaches in South Florida closed on Saturday when tar balls washed ashore, but they've since reopened.",
      "Tar balls are small, dark pieces of oil which can stick to the feet of beachgoers, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "They often come from oil spills, but the source can also be \u201cnatural seeps\u201d in which oil slowly escapes from petroleum reserves beneath the ocean floor, according to NOAA. That was a possible source of tar balls that washed onto the shore in the Huntington Beach area of California in March 2024, officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile some tar balls may be as large as pancakes, most are coin-sized,\u201d the agency says in a fact sheet. \u201cTar balls are very persistent in the marine environment and can travel hundreds of miles.\u201d",
      "For most people, occasional brief contact with a small amount of oil isn't harmful, officials said. But for people who are particularly sensitive to chemicals, tar balls can cause rashes or allergic reactions.",
      "Coast Guard crews conducted searches by air and by sea, but they were unable to find a specific source, Coast Guard Petty Officer Nicholas Strasburg said Wednesday.",
      "It's believed that whatever was washing ashore will naturally dissipate, Strasburg said.",
      "Though the agency is no longer investigating the source of the tar balls, it is working with local communities in case they have any further concerns, he said.",
      "There's been no evidence that the tar balls came from Port Everglades off the shore of Fort Lauderdale, but giant tanker ships routinely sit near the port. Every day, more than 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters) of products including gasoline and jet fuel move through the port on tanker ships and barges, and there are many petroleum terminals in the area, according to the port.",
      "In October, the Canadian Coast Guard cleaned up tar balls floating to the ocean's surface from the site of a World War II era shipwreck off the coast of British Columbia, the Canadian Broadcasting Co. reported. The U.S. Army military transport ship has been leaking oil over the years since it hit a rock and sunk in 1946, the news outlet reported.",
      "In October 2020, tar balls turned up on parts of the Atlantic Ocean shoreline in Delaware and Maryland.",
      "In May 2019, tar balls described as \u201cvery soft\u201d washed up on beaches on Padre Island in Texas and were getting stuck on beachgoers, the Padre Island National Seashore reported at the time.",
      "There were also numerous reports of tar balls along U.S. Gulf Coast beaches after the 2010 explosion and oil spill involving the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig."

      "WASHINGTON -- Civil rights attorneys sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to gain access to detained migrants who they say have been flown to Guantanamo Bay and held there without being able to consult lawyers or speak to relatives.",
      "The federal lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., and backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, says this is the first time in U.S. history that the government has detained non-citizens on civil immigration charges at the U.S. naval base in Cuba.",
      "\u201cAnd it is holding them incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family, or the outside world,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "For decades, the naval base was primarily used to detain foreigners associated with the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. More than 50 detained migrants were transferred there this month and \u201ceffectively disappeared into a black box,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis isolation is no coincidence. Guantanamo is home to one of the most notorious prisons in the world, used when the U.S. government has attempted to operate in secret, without legal constraint or accountability,\u201d the suit says.",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include relatives of three immigrants from Venezuela who were sent to Guantanamo from immigration detention facilities in Texas. The suit accuses government officials of violating their constitutional rights to due process and free speech.",
      "The plaintiffs' attorneys are seeking a court order allowing them to meet with the detainees. They also want an order requiring officials to provide the location of a detainee within 24 hours of their transfer to Guantanamo.",
      "The first U.S. military flight deporting migrants from the U.S. to Guantanamo landed in Cuba on Feb. 4, according to a U.S. official. It was the first step in an expected surge in the number of migrants sent to the U.S. base.",
      "President Donald Trump has said Guantanamo has the capacity to hold as many as 30,000 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was assigned to Guantanamo when he was on active duty, has called it a \u201cperfect place\u201d to house migrants.",
      "Approximately 300 service members are supporting the detention operations at Guantanamo. That number is expected to fluctuate.",
      "Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 5 that more than 8,000 people had been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs also include four advocacy groups: Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, American Gateways and Americans for Immigrant Justice.",
      "They sued the Defense Department, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and their respective department secretaries. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its acting director also are named as defendants.",
      "DHS officials didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the suit's allegations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s troubling enough that we are even sending immigrants from the U.S. to Guantanamo, but it\u2019s beyond the pale that we are holding them incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world,\u201d ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said in a statement.",
      "Attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights and the International Refugee Assistance Project also represent the plaintiffs.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A bill banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Ohio\u2019s public colleges and universities and stripping certain collective bargaining and tenure protections from faculty cleared the Republican-led Ohio Senate on Wednesday, over the objections of more than 1,000 students, educators and others.",
      "Senate Bill 1 would make schools promise not to influence student views on \u201ccontroversial\u201d topics, eliminate the voting rights of student trustees at Ohio State University, require every Ohio college student to take a three-hour civics education course, and impose dozens of other programmatic and administrative changes. Schools that violate the measure \u2014 should it become law \u2014 would risk losing their state funding.",
      "The bill cleared the Senate 21-11, marking the second time the chamber has approved similar legislation since 2023. It heads now to the Ohio House, where it died last session. However, the politics there have changed with the ascension of a new speaker.",
      "Sponsoring GOP Sen. Jerry Cirino said the bill aims to protect \u201cintellectual diversity,\u201d including welcoming more conservative voices on campuses.",
      "\u201cSB 1 addresses the debacle that DEI has become,\u201d Cirino said during floor debate. \u201cIt has morphed into institutional discrimination. It has resulted in students, staff and faculty experiencing discrimination if they do not fit the orthodoxy of DEI. This discrimination must end, along with the millions of dollars that have been spent supporting these often very large (DEI) organizations.\u201d",
      "Democratic senators vehemently pushed back against Republicans' arguments in favor of the bill, with several Black senators delivering particularly fiery rebuttals.",
      "State Sen. Hearcel Craig, a Columbus Democrat who is Black, noted that white supremacist groups have marched in Columbus and Cincinnati in recent weeks.

      "\u201cThey can speak their mind without being canceled. They can consider all sides of an issue, make up their own mind, and they can be honest about their positions without fear of faculty retaliation,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, higher education across our nation largely has become a bastion of liberal bias. True, there are instances where this is not the case. But it has become pervasive enough that we must act.\u201d",
      "Democratic Sen. Bill DeMora, of Columbus, called the bill \u201canti-union, anti-free speech\u201d and said its passage could contribute to political divisions that are growing more stark \u2014 given that nearly every topic can be defined as \u201ccontroversial.\u201d",
      "\u201cEssentially, any one person is allowed to report their school for any professor doing any one thing they don't like and their schools could potentially lose all their funding because of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's completely ridiculous, and that's the big reason my colleagues and I call this the death of higher education as we know it.\u201d",
      "Newly confirmed Ohio Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, a former Buckeyes football coach who spent most of his career in higher education, said Wednesday that he was serving as president of Youngstown State University when work began on Cirino's first bill.",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump may be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports",
      "NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump could be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington on Wednesday, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports.",
      "India, a key strategic partner of the United States, has so far been spared any new tariffs, and the two leaders have cultivated a personal relationship. Modi \u2014 a nationalist criticized over India\u2019s democratic backsliding \u2014 has welcomed Trump's return to the White House, seeking to reset India\u2019s relationship with the West over his refusal to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly referred to India as a \u201ctariff king\u201d and pressed the South Asian country on the deportation of migrants. In response, New Delhi has shown a willingness to lower its own tariffs on U.S. products, accept Indian citizens back and buy American oil.",
      "But as tariff threats loom, the question remains how much a good rapport between two leaders matters and how far India will go to cut a deal.",
      "Modi had established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office, and the two can build on the areas of convergence and \u201cminimize areas of friction without conceding on core areas of national interest,\u201d says Meera Shankar, India\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S.",
      "\u201cMost other partners have their reciprocal lists ready from the word go, because it\u2019s a point of leverage when you negotiate,\" Shankar added, expressing hope that India \u201cwill find the right balance between firmness and flexibility\u201d on the tariffs issue.",
      "Modi \u2014 boosted by his ruling Hindu nationalist party's victory in the high-stakes state legislature election last weekend in India\u2019s federal territory, including New Delhi \u2014 said before leaving for Washington that the visit was an \u201copportunity to build upon\" collaboration during Trump's first term and \u201cdeepen our partnership\u201d in areas such as technology, trade, defense and energy.",
      "Speaking with Modi in January, Trump emphasized the importance of India buying more American-made military gear and weapons, as well as reducing the trade imbalance. Last year, the U.S. imported $50 billion more in goods than it sold to India.",
      "A readout from the White House at the time said Trump \"emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, India accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Also, Modi's government lowered some high tariffs, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40%. In 2023, India had dropped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts.",
      "\u201cAnother thing we can expect is that Modi would offer to purchase more American (natural) gas to narrow the U.S. trade deficit,\" said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThis will help a little bit.\u201d",
      "India is seen as integral to the U.S. strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific and is to host a summit of a group of countries known as the Quad \u2014 made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014 later this year.",
      "But India will likely have to recalibrate its stand in case of a Washington-Beijing thaw under Trump.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s outreach to China will complicate India\u2019s ability to cultivate the American desire to use India as a proxy against China without actually ever becoming one,\u201d said Happymon Jacob, founder of the New Delhi-based Council for Strategic and Defense Research.",
      "India turned the page with China and in December agreed to work toward a solution to their long-running border dispute in the Himalayas after a military standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020.",
      "\u201cEven a tactical accommodation between the U.S. and China has implications for India,\u201d Shankar said.",
      "The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trade partner, with a trade deficit of $50 billion in India\u2019s favor. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. According to India\u2019s External Affairs Ministry, the U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.",
      "India depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment, but the war in Ukraine has added to doubts about future supplies, and New Delhi has been looking more toward the U.S., Israel, Britain, and others.",
      "A recently struck deal will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.",

      "\u201cFor India, that could also be an area where we see some synergies with the U.S.,\u201d Shankar said, adding that Trump will likely seek to persuade India to buy more defense equipment.",
      "Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore, said Modi's visit will be a good time to advance Indo-U.S. ties.",

      "\u201cThere is no looming threat. This case is over. It will not be brought back,\u201d the attorney, Alex Spiro, told reporters. \u201cDespite a lot of fanfare and sensational claims, ultimately there was no evidence that he broke any laws ever.\u201d",
      "But as Spiro touted what he described as total victory over a \u201cmisguided prosecution,\u201d the reality of the Justice Department's move, outlined in a two-page memo sent Monday, is more complicated.",
      "In that letter, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said the order to halt the case was made without \u201cassessing the strength of the evidence\u201d against Adams \u2014 but was instead intended to allow him to focus on executing the Trump administration\u2019s priorities around immigration and crime.",
      "The directive was contingent on Adams agreeing that the case could be reopened in November following the mayoral election, Bove wrote.",
      "Those unusual terms have drawn skepticism from some Democrats, and fierce rebuke from the mayor's Democratic primary challengers, who contend that Adams has agreed to carry out Trump's hardline immigration agenda in exchange for his freedom.",
      "Speaking to reporters in his office Wednesday, Spiro denied that Adams had made any such promise. But he acknowledged that immigration and other policy issues were discussed at a meeting between the mayor\u2019s legal team and Justice Department officials ahead of the directive to halt the case.",
      "\u201cThe functioning of the government, and the mayor\u2019s ability to enforce national security issues, terrorism threats, immigration issues and everything else, of course it came up,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "The order directs the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, to dismiss the charges \"as soon as is practicable.\u201d A spokesperson for her office declined to comment. There have been no new filings in the case two days after the memo and Adams had not signed anything yet, his lawyer said.",
      "Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges that he accepted about $100,000 of free or deeply discounted international flights, hotel stays, meals and entertainment in return for illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and members of the Turkish business community.",
      "Prosecutors also allege he personally directed campaign staffers to solicit donations from foreign nationals, which are banned under federal law. Those contributions were disguised in order to allow Adams to qualify for a city program providing a generous, publicly-funded match for small dollar donations.",
      "His trial was scheduled to start in April."

      "Scrim, a 17-pound mutt who has become a Louisiana folk hero, first escaped from his adopted family in April and roamed the city for months until he was cornered and brought back home. Weeks later, in October, he leaped out of a second-story window in a moment recorded on video that got attention online.",
      "During his months on the lam, Scrim survived a hurricane and freezing blizzard conditions. A posse of volunteers tracked his movements over 57 square miles (148 square kilometers) using wildlife surveillance cameras and a crowdsourced map of sightings.",
      "The renowned fugitive was ultimately captured in a cat trap, said Michelle Cheramie, the owner of animal rescue nonprofit Zeus' Rescues who led the mission to find Scrim. Cheramie, a former information technology professional who has devoted her life to caring for animals after losing her home during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has said she was \u201cborn to rescue.\u201d",
      "The elated Cheramie held Scrim in arms on Tuesday after giving him a much-needed bath. The pooch appeared calm, and a vet found him in good shape. During his first time on the run last year, Scrim suffered lacerations and was founded embedded with what appeared to be small bullets.",
      "\u201cHe endured so much. I needed him safe. He is not a feral dog,\u201d Cheramie said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put him in a place where he has access to go on long walks, where he has access to vet care and he doesn\u2019t have to run and hide from loud scary noises.\u201d",

      "Before Scrim joins his new family, Cheramie plans to enjoy his presence.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to sleep in bed with me tonight and it\u2019s going to be the most amazing thing,\" Cheramie said. \u201cIt's so good to have him in my arms. It's everything I ever wanted.\u201d",

Almost none are openly questioning the purpose or legality of the DOGE effort, which the party has largely cheered.

      "The Illinois Democrat once lauded as the longest-serving legislative leader in American history has been found guilty of some charges at his federal corruption trial in Chicago",
      "CHICAGO -- A Chicago Democrat who once set much of Illinois\u2019 political agenda as the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history was convicted of some charges Wednesday in a mixed verdict in his high-profile corruption trial.",
      "Jurors convicted former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan 10 counts and acquitted him of seven, but could not reach a decision on six counts. They returned the verdict after deliberating more than 10 days in a bribery case that led to the downfall of a man who was nicknamed the \u201cVelvet Hammer\u201d for his forceful yet quiet leadership style.",
      "The backbone of federal prosecutors\u2019 case was hours of videos and phone calls secretly recorded by a onetime Chicago alderman turned FBI informant. But the most surprising moment was when the normally private Madigan took the stand himself, strongly denying all wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cWhen people asked me for help, if possible, I tried to help them,\u201d he testified.",
      "Madigan, who was speaker for more than three decades and once led the Democratic Party of Illinois, was charged in a 23-count indictment with racketeering conspiracy, using interstate facilities in aid of bribery, wire fraud and attempted extortion.",
      "Among multiple schemes, he was accused of using his influence to pass legislation favorable to utility companies that doled out kickbacks, jobs and contracts to his loyalists. An attorney, Madigan was also accused of benefiting from private work that was illegally steered to his law firm.",
      "\u201cTime and again, Madigan abused the tremendous power he wielded,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz during closing arguments.",
      "The trial, which began in October, featured more than 60 witnesses, including a congresswoman, business leaders and former state legislators. Prosecutors presented photographs, transcripts and recordings on alleged schemes. For instance, he allegedly tried to have state-owned land in Chicago\u2019s Chinatown neighborhood transferred to the city for development and expected developers of a hotel project to hire his tax firm.",
      "The trial was also a glimpse into how Madigan, who famously didn\u2019t use a cellphone or email, operated behind closed doors. The lines between his roles were often blurred. Madigan, who represented a district near Midway International Airport on Chicago\u2019s southwest side, often had meetings at his downtown law office, whether they were for political or legal work. Elected officials or his political advisers met alongside business contacts. Even in meetings about tax work, he was called \u201cthe speaker,\u201d the recordings show.",
      "On the stand, Madigan cast himself as a devoted public servant with a tough upbringing in a working-class Chicago neighborhood. But federal prosecutors on cross-examination, sometimes in tense exchanges, probed about his comments on the secret recordings, including one where he chuckled that some of his loyalists \u201cmade out like bandits.\u201d",
      "Madigan, 82, left political office in 2021 while under investigation and was indicted the following year.",
      "During the trial, he watched the proceedings intently, taking notes on a legal pad. Several of his family members attended, including his daughter, Lisa Madigan, who served four terms as Illinois attorney general. She declined to seek reelection in 2018.",
      "First elected to the Legislature in 1970, Michael Madigan was the Illinois House speaker from 1983 to 2021, except for two years when Republicans were in control. He decided which legislation would be voted on, oversaw political mapmaking and controlled several campaign funds.",
      "Standing trial alongside Madigan was longtime confidant Michael McClain, who prosecutors called Madigan\u2019s \u201cmouthpiece.\u201d Jurors were deadlocked on all of the charges McClain faced. The onetime state legislator and former lobbyist also stood trial last year in a related case and was convicted with three others of a bribery conspiracy involving ComEd, the state\u2019s largest utility company."

      "The rise comes weeks after the US central bank decided to hold interest rates, saying there was significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed.",
      "It poses a challenge to US President Donald Trump, who made tackling inflation a centrepiece of his election campaign last year, but has put forward policies, such as higher tariffs on imports, that economists say risk pushing up prices.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest report could put pressure on Trump to reconsider those plans, which would raise taxes on goods entering the country.",
      "\"Tariffs can still be used as a bargaining tool to get some concessions from other countries, but the political optics of putting even a little upward pressure on consumer prices via tariffs wouldn't be great for the Trump administration,\" he wrote.",

      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",

      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar. But opinions are divided on it.",
      "On Monday, 27 November 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",
      "\"I remember leaving and seeing my mum and grandma waiting for me, crying,\" says Mr Rojas, who was just 10-years-old at the time. \"It was a very, very sad day.\"",
      "Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris.",
      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.com in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) compared the advert with other photos of the same model and did not think she looked unhealthily thin in those.",
      "But it said in the now-banned image, emphasising the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, pose and styling was \"irresponsible\".",
      "Next said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a \"healthy and toned physique\".",
      "In response to the ASA, the retailer said the 5'9\" model's pose was chosen \"specifically to display the leggings' fit on both straight and bent legs\", and that the image, which was shot nearly two years ago, was created with a \"strong sense of responsibility\".",
      "A spokesperson added a Next stylist and product image manager met the model in person and \"did not have any concerns about her health\".",
      "In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged the model's face \"did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones\".",
      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",
      "Next said it had not used digital retouching to alter the model's appearance but did digitally alter the appearance of the leggings by bringing them down further towards the model's ankle on both legs.",
      "This was not said to alter the model's natural proportions.",
      "The ASA told Next that its advert breached the code for social responsibility.",
      "It said the ad must not appear again in its current form, and that Next  should ensure the images in their ads were \"prepared responsibly and did not portray models as being unhealthily thin.\"",
      "\"You do wonder how it got through,\" fashion journalist Victoria Moss told BBC Breakfast.",

      "The \"body positivity\" movement which began around 2010 focused particularly on promoting a more diverse range of models.",
      "But Ms Moss told BBC Breakfast she thinks the body positivity movement is \"slightly under threat\".",
      "\"The wider industry is veering towards a very thin model look,\" she said.",
      "Adding: \"With a rise of weight loss injection drugs there's a rise of talk in the media of people taking these drugs and I think that's really pushed this idea of everyone has to be thin much more to the fore again.\"",
      "She said \"bigger girls are simply not being cast\" for fashion campaigns and raised concerns over a rise in eating disorders among young women along with more \"thinspiration pictures\" being posted on social media.",

      "Chioma Nnadi suggested the change, a departure from recent progress in body diversity, had been partly fuelled by the rise in popularity of weightloss drugs like Ozempic.",
      "In 2023, the ASA banned fashion retailer Warehouse from using an image of a model in an oversized biker jacket, saying the model's pronounced collar bone, hip bones and torso gave the appearance of her being \"very thin\", which made the ad \"irresponsible\".",

      "Reeves' decision to back Heathrow's expansion has angered campaigners and members of her party who oppose it on environmental grounds.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye signed a pact to use UK steel to build new infrastructure.",

      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, many politicians, as well as nearby local authorities and residents.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",

      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",

      "The government announced the law will be enforced for damp and mould problems from October - and fully implemented for all other hazards by 2027. Private renters will be protected in the same way - says the government - once its Renters' Rights Bill becomes law, expected later this year.",

      "Area Estates told us it had authorised professional managing agents \"to look after the [Rotherham] property in accordance with all regulations\", and to \"carry out day-to-day maintenance\", and that requests for more expensive repairs were always responded to quickly.",

It said it had always attempted to address any problems in a timely manner - and had completed 13 different inspection and repair works at the property between 2023 and 2024.",
      "When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: \"I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'.\"",

      "In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was \"unfit for human habitation\".",
      "Sinead also applied for social housing, submitting evidence about Aziyah's health. But the council said he had not had \"frequent A&E visits with hospital admissions and complex treatment\".",
      "Brighton and Hove City Council says the issues it has the legal power to enforce at Sinead's flat have now been addressed by the private landlord. It says it has also recommended improvements to \"ventilation and insulation\" that it \"can encourage but cannot enforce\".",

    "summary": "The Drax facility, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood from.",
    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable.",
      "\"Ofgem required a further audit to be undertaken and they are working closely with Drax to ensure any misreporting does not happen again.\"",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "summary": "Students explain their hopes for the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship.",
    "story": [
      "David Boutflour's background is as far from the glamour of space launches as it's possible to imagine.",
      "The 31-year-old worked in hospitality for nine years, becoming the general manager for a gastro-pub in Cheshire. But it wasn't the real career for him. \"I felt I could do more,\" he says.",
      "Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration.",
      "A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems.",
      "To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction.",
      "\"Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!\"",
      "The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites.",
      "Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering.",
      "The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time.",
      "Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship.",
      "One of those is Alice Overend.",
      "Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course.",
      "This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023.",
      "This incident made a deep impression on her. \"It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home.\"",
      "Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work.",
      "Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. \"The whole space sector is going in a good direction.\"",
      "She explains the true meaning of \"space systems\" in her world.",
      "\"Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right.\"",
      "George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering.",
      "In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts.",
      "How did the go-kart perform? \"It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working.\"",
      "Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course.",
      "\"The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do.\"",
      "Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day \"if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut\".",
      "Right now the course is meeting his expectations. \"To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door.\"",
      "Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems.",
      "Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists.",
      "\"Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers.\"",
      "The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course.",
      "She agrees that specialisation is less important than aptitude in the space sector. \"Employers want a problem solving mind-set. And I have noticed a real appetite from students for more space content in their course.\"",
      "Proposals to build rocket-launching sites in remote locations such as the Shetland Islands mean more positions should open up in the UK space industry in the very near future.",
      "After the grounding of the Space Shuttle in 2011 Mr Boutfleur felt space exploration \"took a step backwards.\"",
      "Now he says the success of Elon Musk's SpaceX reusable launchers is enormously significant.",
      "\"Musk has very much re-ignited the space race\".",
      "All three students agree that the hands-on side of the course is inspiring.",
      "And outside of the space syllabus what do they get up to?",
      "\"Most of us play video games,\" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement.",

      "Schools across Stoke-on-Trent are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The city's schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",

      "Schools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract ends",
      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",
      "Contract makes school pay thousands to cut grass",
      "Cold and leaky school 'causing pupils stress'",
      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",
      "When something isn't fixed quickly, or part of a school is out of use, these maintenance contracts allow for money to be held back from the private contractor. In this contract, Stoke-on-Trent City Council is responsible for making sure that happens.",
      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "She had challenged in 2023 an employment appeal tribunal judgement, which ruled in her favour but sent the case back to another tribunal for a fresh decision on whether her dismissal was lawful - a step her lawyers described as \"unnecessary\".",
      "In the judgement published on Wednesday, three judges ruled in her favour and found the decision to take the case back to an employment tribunals was \"unlawfully discriminatory\".",
      "In October 2018, Mrs Higgs shared two posts to Facebook to about 100 friends under her maiden name, one of which referred to \"brainwashing our children\".",
      "Another referred to \"suppressing Christianity and removing it from the public arena\".",
      "The posts referred to LGBT+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) teaching at her son's Church of England primary school, rather than at the school she worked at.",
      "In the ruling handed down earlier, Lord Justice Underhill, sitting with Lord Justice Bean and Lady Justice Falk, said Ms Higgs had posted messages \"mostly quoted from other sources, objecting to government policy on sex education in primary schools because of its promotion of 'gender fluidity' and its equation of same-sex marriage with marriage between a man and a woman\".",
      "The ruling said it was not disputed that Mrs Higgs' beliefs that gender is binary and same-sex marriage cannot be equated to marriage between a man and a woman were protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The school had dismissed Mrs Higgs for gross misconduct, on the basis that her posts were liable to damage the school's reputation.",

      "Before that, fees had only increased by \u00a3250 since 2012, when they tripled to \u00a39,000.",
      "Costs, including staff salaries and building works, have continued to rise in that time - meaning budgets have been getting tighter and tighter.",
      "And the issues are not just limited to England and Wales. Queen's University Belfast has faced criticism this week over its decision to open a campus in India while planning to cut up to 270 jobs.",
      "The government says it is \"committed to fixing the foundations of higher education\", while Universities UK, which represents 141 universities, says the sector has been \"doing more with less for years\".",
      "'Anger and uncertainty'",
      "For Cardiff University final-year languages student Darcie James, 23, the headlines hit close to home after her university last month announced plans to cut 400 jobs and close some courses.",
      "Her faculty, which she says \"feels like a little family\", is now at risk of closure. Nursing and music courses are also under threat.",
      "The University and College Union (UCU) branch says it will have a no-confidence vote in the leadership team at the university over the plans.",
      "Branch president Joey Whitfield, senior lecturer in Hispanic studies, says there is \"a lot of anger and uncertainty\", and that some students have reported staff crying to them during lectures.",
      "The university's vice-chancellor, Prof Wendy Larner, says the university's final plans \"will be shaped by our community\" in a 90-day consultation.",
      "\"The scale of the challenge will remain, but the way that we address it will certainly be refined and developed over the next 90 days,\" she says.",
      "Student Darcie says she was \"really shocked\" by the announcements, and that, as someone who has lived with anxiety, her course - in particular her year abroad in France and Spain - has \"made her as a person\".",
      "She says it is \"so important others have that available too\".",
      "'It feels like you're running into a wall'",
      "In January, the University of Kent said more jobs would be cut in a bid to save nearly \u00a320m.",
      "Last February, the university announced proposals to cut 58 jobs and \"phase out\" six subjects - art history, anthropology, health and social care, music and audio technology, journalism, and philosophy and religious studies - in response to its \"financial challenges\".",
      "Third-year journalism student Brendan Papp, 21, is being \"taught out\" - meaning students currently on the cancelled course are seeing it through until completion.",
      "When he applied, he says the course ranked in the top five in the country. Now, he says, it's fallen to \"dead last\".",
      "An international student from Virginia in the US, Brendan came to the UK to chase his dream of becoming a sports reporter. Now, he's keen to complete his course so he can move to Madrid to do sports management instead.",

      "Nathan Wyatt, 23, the student union's welfare officer and a former politics student, says he led the charge against previous cuts in 2023.",
      "He says there is a feeling of \"fatigue\" about facing more cuts.",
      "\"The consensus on campus is that people are feeling drained, and they don't have the energy to go out and say 'no cuts' as loudly as they did before.\"",
      "Nadine Zubair, a digital humanities manager and co-chair of the university's UCU branch, says students and staff are affected by the cuts \"in every aspect of their experience here: their morale, their workloads - everything is taking a hit\".",
      "\"We are a world-leading sector, but the world is watching us crumble under our own managerial panic or desperation.\"",
      "A university spokesperson says UEA is still committed to \"high-quality student education and experience, and we will work hard to limit any impact on students\".",
      "They say \"compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort\".",
      "'It's making me reconsider a Masters'",
      "Durham University says it wants to save \u00a310m in staff costs by cutting about 200 professional services roles this year.",

      "Student Lily Gershon, 22, co-editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, says the cuts are making her reconsider whether she wants to go on to do a postgraduate course at Durham.",
      "She says the professional services staff who are facing cuts this year make up the \"backbone\" of the university.",
      "Lily, from Hong Kong, says her mum \"sacrifices\" to pay for her to go to university as she is not entitled to a student loan and lives on about \u00a350 per week.",
      "But she says being the cohort whose exams were cancelled due to Covid means \"we're quite a resilient bunch, so we know we can adapt\".",
      "Katie Muth, assistant professor in digital humanities and modern literature - and a member of Durham's UCU Committee - says colleagues are \"pretty worried across the board\" by the university's announcements.",
      "She says \"there's a lot of anxiety\" and colleagues are concerned about their workloads increasing as people leave.",
      "\"People are already working at or above capacity,\" she says.",
      "She believes \"band-aid\" solutions are not going to fix a higher education sector in need of systemic changes.",
      "A university spokesperson says all departments are being asked to find savings, and the university is engaging with staff \"in an open and transparent way\".",
      "They say any voluntary staff departure \"would be considered in relation to the likely workload impact and opportunities to reduce workload\".",
      "How did we get here?",
      "After the freeze on fees, universities say finances have been getting tighter for years.",
      "Then there was the shock of new visa restrictions on international postgraduates coming to the UK bringing their partners and children.",
      "International students pay higher fees, but the introduction of those restrictions in January 2024 has led to a drop of around 16% in applications.",
      "That, in turn, has led to more competition between universities to secure places for UK students.",
      "The body which regulates higher education in England, the Office for Students (OfS), has warned that without change on a scale not seen before, 72% of universities could slide into financial deficit - where a university spends more than it is bringing in - by 2026.",
      "\"We have called for universities and colleges to take bold, transformative steps to address the challenges, and we know that many are taking action already,\" an OfS spokesperson said.",
      "It is also nearly impossible to tell if a university will go bust.",
      "That is because universities borrow money from banks based on the value of the assets they own, like buildings and land. If they get into financial trouble, they will renegotiate the terms of their loan with the bank - and no bank wants to see a university which owes them money failing financially.",
      "The Department for Education says the government inherited a \"dire economic situation\" and has taken \"tough decisions to bolster universities' financial sustainability\".",
      "\"The Office for Students is rightly refocusing its efforts on monitoring financial sustainability, to help create a secure future for our world-leading sector,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Whilst institutions are autonomous, we are committed to fixing the foundations of higher education to deliver change for students.\"",

      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

      "Warning: This story contains distressing details",
      "Prosecutors, who have not specified a motive for the stabbing, called Sir Salman to the stand as the first witness on Tuesday morning, asking him to recall the moments before and after the attack.",
      "The 77-year-old told the jury that on the day in question, he had been sitting on stage ready to address an audience at the prestigious Chautauqua Institution.",
      "It was shortly after Sir Salman was introduced that he said he noticed a person rushing at him from his right-hand side.",
      "He described the attacker as wearing dark clothes and a face mask, and said he was struck by the individual's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\".",

      "Sir Salman's wife, Lady Rushdie, cried from her seat in the second row as her husband recounted the incident.",

    "story": [
      "BBC journalist Nick Robinson says his X account was hacked and used to promote cryptocurrency after he was apparently targeted in an online phishing scam.",
      "The Today programme presenter became locked out of his account on X, previously known as Twitter, on Monday night after he clicked a link in an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.",
      "Robinson, 61, said that he was still locked out of his account on Tuesday after his passwords were changed, \"so anything you read today, it won't be me\".",
      "A cyber security expert said such attacks were likely to be opportunistic, with code instead of humans seeking out social media users who have a large number of followers, to exploit them.",
      "The email sent to Robinson was designed to look like it was legitimate, and included a link it said would allow him to review content it claimed had violated X's policies to stop his account being suspended.",
      "But the email address which sent the email did not end with \"@x.com\" or \"@e.X.com\" addresses used by the platform for official communication.",
      "Following Tuesday's Today programme, Robinson said he had fallen for the scam despite having completed online security courses which highlighted tell-tale signs of phishing emails.",
      "He said: \"Why? Because my defences were down - I was tired after a very long day, I was rushing, and the phishing email made me think that if I didn't act fast I'd be in trouble.",
      "\"However, I didn't just fall for it. I tried repeatedly to use the official authentic X site to deal with the problem I was being alerted to, and only after trying again and again and failing did I think 'oh sod it, what's the worst that can happen?'",
      "\"Well now I know. I should have thought the opposite - i.e. if this alleged problem is really serious they'll be in touch again.\"",
      "He added: \"My main mistake was not to check the email address which made clear it wasn't X that were contacting me but a hacker. Everything else looked just like the real thing.\"",
      "Robinson told Today listeners the hack came days after he was \"swamped by critical messages\" from supporters of Elon Musk after he had pointed out a statement made by the billionaire owner of X was untrue.",
      "His Today co-host Amol Rajan had raised the hack, joking that his \"very own tech bro, the mighty Nick Robinson, has finally succumbed to the temptations online, and I see overnight, is launching a cryptocurrency\".",
      "\"This is the big news in Britain, and what listeners want to know, Nick, is how do they invest?,\" he added.",
      "Robinson said his account had been used to make it look like he was launching a cryptocurrency called '$Today' on the Solana blockchain platform.",
      "\"So if you read that, it's complete nonsense, quite entertaining nonsense,\" Robinson told the programme.",
      "He added: \"But there's a lesson learned - don't click on everything you see.\"",
      "Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by low-skilled cyber criminals to make a quick buck.",
      "They often spread the net wide by sending out phishing emails to many high profile accounts in order to maximise their chances of getting a bite. At that point they take over the account and plan their posts around hastily spun up crypto coins that can only take a couple of hours to create and launch.",
      "They hope that high profile and trusted accounts might encourage people to buy some of the otherwise worthless coins so that they can make some money before it all get blocked and stopped. In this case it looks like the scammers failed to make much money at all for their efforts.",
      "But Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cyber-security firm Darktrace, said anyone can be targeted and fall victim to similar hacking scams.",
      "\"There are signs we can look out for. But the problem with these emails is they are designed to attack us when we are distracted and busy,\" he said.",
      "\"Good advice is don't don't click links in emails. If it's an important message, it will be there on the relevant website for me when I log on to it.",
      "\"But with these type of threats, they will always evolve.\"",

      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",

      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",

      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "summary": "After Lamar's show, a reminder of where we are now in the big rap feud, and exactly how we got here.",
    "story": [
      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",
      "What's more he used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.",
      "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
      "Taylor Swift, Lionel Messi, Jay-Z and Trump among big names at Super Bowl",
      "Eagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peat",
      "Kendrick comes out fighting",
      "Lamar finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute riposte on record.",
      "Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it saw him brand Drake as \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and a \"habitual liar\",  while calling his sparring partner's parenting skills into question.",
      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",
      "\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.",
      "Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.",
      "\"Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor \u2026 B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?\"",
      "Club hit",
      "Lamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us became a big summer club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release.",
      "It went on to earn one billion streams on Spotify and later five Grammy Awards, at last month's ceremony, including song of the year.",
      "Things took a darker turn, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot although there is no proof it was connected to the rappers' feud. However, the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London apparently was.",
      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",
      "Williams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.",
      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "Cowboy Carter is, obviously, the name of Beyonc\u00e9's latest album.",
      "But \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.",
      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",
      "Venues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.",
      "Almost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.",
      "The circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.",
      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",
      "\"I also think she, in some ways, has a nostalgic reference, because it was such a communal circuit with a lot of performers,\" she says.",

      "Beyonc\u00e9 fan and music history content creator Nat Brown feels that's not a coincidence.",
      "Unlike Renaissance, this tour is smaller with only eight cities being played in total globally, with six of those in the US.",
      "\"It's a very small tour,\" says Nat.",
      "\"Just like it historically was with the Chitlin' Circuit, where you only went to seven to 10 places.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 01:36:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Jurors had been questioned about whether Rihanna's connection to the case could sway the verdict",
    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:03:13 GMT",
    "summary": "What was it like to act in a video game thought to have one of the longest scripts ever written for the medium?",
    "story": [
      "You'll often hear about actors and the role of a lifetime, but for Tom McKay and Luke Dale it's especially relevant.",
      "For the past nine years they've dedicated most of their working lives to two video games - Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD) and its sequel.",
      "Added together, the scripts for the role-playing epics set in 15th Century Bohemia run to more than three million words, according to their makers.",
      "It's thought that KCD 2, which came out last week, could be the longest single video game script ever written.",
      "Both actors spoke to BBC Newsbeat about what it was like to be part of such a huge project and working with the game's controversial director.",
      "The original KCD was something of a slow-burn sleeper hit. Its review scores were respectable when it released in 2018 but it wasn't universally acclaimed.",
      "However, it found a passionate fanbase in the months and years afterwards and the appetite for a sequel grew.",
      "KCD 2 arrived to positive reviews and sold one million copies within 24 hours of launching.",
      "The sequel follows the story of Tom's character Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son turned knight, and Luke's character, the impulsive Sir Hans Capon.",
      "It's a sprawling, open-ended game that allows players to carve their own path through it.",
      "This means it's possible to find important characters or items outside of the storylines that revolve around them, and the game will respond to these variable possibilities.",
      "That's something the game's developers have to account for, and something that Tom in particular, as the main playable character, needs to act out over and over again with subtle differences each time.",
      "It meant hundreds of hours of studio time and repeat trips to Prague, where developer Warhorse Studios is based.",
      "He says it was \"one of the most amazing and unusual acting challenges\" he's faced.",
      "\"You would kind of go down one channel of a decision and then come halfway back up and go down another one and then maybe all the way back up to the beginning and back down,\" he says.",
      "\"And that's not an acting challenge that you ever would have in TV or film.\"",
      "The video games industry is secretive, and both Tom and Luke spent three years under a non-disclosure agreement as they made the second game.",
      "\"It was almost like working for GCHQ or something,\" says Tom, referring to the British intelligence agency.",
      "\"You couldn't talk to anyone about it and people in the studio couldn't even talk to their partners in some cases about what they were doing.\"",
      "Tom says he would occasionally bump into fans of the game when he was working on other projects, and would have to dodge the question when they grilled him about a sequel.",
      "He says it was more difficult when he bumped into fans of the game in the Czech Republic, where the game is celebrated as a national success story.",
      "When they asked why he was spending so much time in Prague, Tom admits he had to bend the truth a little.",
      "\"I'd be like: 'I just love Prague. And I come here very often for lots of holidays,\" he says.",
      "Luke says many fans \"gave up hope\" that a sequel was on the way, given the six-year gap between the two titles.",
      "But when the new game was revealed, he says, there was \"this incredible reception and everyone went absolutely crazy\".",
      "It also reignited an online discourse that had erupted around the release of the original KCD.",
      "Daniel V\u00e1vra, the co-founder and creative director of Warhorse, is a regular poster on social media and is quick to answer critics.",
      "He defended the first KCD, when it was criticised for its lack of diversity, as being historically accurate to the time and location of its setting, although there is not universal agreement about this.",
      "At the time he also made public statements against perceived attempts to force diversity into games, saying his upbringing in communist Czechoslovakia had made him an opponent of \"censorship in the name of good intentions\".",
      "This won him supporters among the so-called Gamergate movement, which emerged online in 2014 and is widely seen as a backlash against attempts to make gaming more inclusive.",
      "Members celebrated V\u00e1vra for his outspoken, uncompromising approach.",
      "But as the release of KCD 2 approached some of those voices turned against him as it emerged that the sequel features a black character and a gay love scene that can play out if players make certain decisions.",
      "\"I think it's quite a quite an interesting thing that's happened,\" says Luke.",
      "\"With the first game there was a backlash from a more left-wing mentality and then there's been something of a backlash this time around from the right-wing mentality.\"",
      "Both Luke and Tom, having spent the days after KCD 2's release meeting fans, say they believe the complaints are from an unrepresentative minority.",
      "\"It's a really good barometer of the distortion between online interaction and real world interaction,\" says Tom.",
      "\"We did nine hours and it didn't come up once.\"",
      "Luke adds: \"I think to be honest with you, the people that are true big fans of gaming and this game aren't bothered about that sort of stuff.",
      "\"It seems to be people that are really politically involved and they care very much about politics and not gaming and they've just used this as a weapon, but they're not necessarily into gaming.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 03:47:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Grab your diary and your ice cream - here are Bridget's relatable wisdoms for those trying to survive adulthood.",
    "story": [
      "Your 20s are a whirlwind of bad dates, career crises, and wondering if you'll ever really get your life together.",
      "Enter Bridget Jones, the queen of chaotic charm, who has been stumbling through life lessons since before many of us can remember.",
      "Despite the original Bridget Jones's Diary book being released in 1996 and the film in 2001, it seems the floundering and flawed heroine has captivated the hearts of Gen Z, who weren't born when Helen Fielding's novel was first published.",
      "Fielding says she finds it \"comforting\" that women in their 20s have a real interest in Bridget\u2019s trials and tribulations. At her book signings, she says \"half the audience are Gen Zs\".",
      "From navigating embarrassing work mishaps to realising that self love (and maybe an extra glass of Chardonnay) is the key to happiness, Bridget has been there, done that, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "Ahead of the release of the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy next week, we've been speaking to three women in their 20s about the life lessons the character taught them: Sophie Gwillym from Cardiff, 28, Hannah Booth in Chester, 25, and 27-year-old Sophie Tyler from Yorkshire.",
      "And then there's us - Yasmin and Noor - both fans of the franchise who have a lot to say about it.",
      "When did you discover Bridget Jones?",
      "Yasmin: In the summer before high school, I stole a tattered copy of Bridget Jones's Diary from my parents' bookshelf and read it all in one night hidden under my duvet. To me, it was a bible for adult life, which, being on the edge of puberty and going into year seven, felt like a total must-read. Almost all of it went over my head at that age but one thing stuck with me: Bridget Jones felt like a real woman who, unlike other perfect heroines that featured in many stories that were actually aimed at children, was flawed and nuanced.",
      "Noor: I was at school and I remember my English teacher talking about one of the films. She was refusing to go see it, as she felt the whole premise was completely unrealistic (\"As if such a beautiful, competent woman would be struggling to find love\"). But my older sister was going, so I tagged along and it was love at first sight plus I'll admit I fancied Hugh Grant just a bit.",
      "Sophie T: My best friend and I watched the first film at a sleepover when we were about 14. I think, on reflection, the scene where Bridget sleeps with Hugh Grant\u2019s character, Daniel Cleaver, for the first time probably wasn't appropriate for us...  I do remember thinking she shouldn't have worn the big knickers (but I would've had no idea why), and we giggled through all the adult bits.",
      "What can a 1990s icon teach someone in their 20s about love today?",
      "Noor: Bridget Jones's obsession with Daniel Cleaver was my life in my 20s. I was chasing after bad boys and addicted to the drama, so it was completely relatable. My friends and I were in endless casual relationships \u2013 and that's very Bridget too. Her dating life was the definition of the situationship, before that was even a thing. But what I really like is how she (eventually) realises she deserves better. She teaches us you can find a Mr Darcy who loves you \"just as you are\" \u2013 even if he does wear reindeer jumpers and fold his pants before bed.",
      "Yasmin: Bridget has given us the ultimate guide to getting over a heartbreak: lying on the sofa wearing old pyjamas and eating ice cream out of the tub while you sob to All By Myself. Unlike the Bridget of the early films, today's 20-somethings aren't incessantly checking for answerphone messages but we are guilty of a bit of post-breakup stalking. Even if the tech isn't the same, early Bridget's neurotic tendencies can still teach us that obsessing over someone is rarely worth it.",
      "Sophie G: Bridget isn't a perfect character, and that's OK. You should be loved for who you are and not try to change yourself to fit in with what society thinks you should be - but learning to accept that is a hard task.",
      "Hannah: At first, Bridget is the epitome of a woman who thinks she needs a man to survive but by the end of the first film, she teaches us to value nice, respectful guys and not to tolerate people who cheat (though, admittedly, they shouldn't have made Daniel Cleaver so hot!).",
      "She also teaches us how to work at a relationship, that love is a choice as well as a feeling, and how to be vulnerable and have boundaries at the same time.",
      "What does Bridget's character mean to you?",
      "Sophie T: It comes back to not needing to change yourself in a society that pressurises us constantly to be skinnier, taller, to read more books and be the best at hobbies. Having a character with self-acceptance is so important when we are constantly being pressured to change ourselves.",
      "Yasmin: I love that Bridget embraces her chaotic energy and that really appeals to Gen Z. If she was a woman in her 20s now, she'd definitely have fallen madly in love with the concept of brat summer - instead of Chaka Khan, she'd be blaring out Charli XCX's 365 through her headphones on her morning commute.",
      "Noor: Wear the big knickers. Eating the entire contents of your fridge is OK sometimes. And don't be defeated by a bad hair day!",
      "But, isn't the series a bit problematic for 2025?",
      "Yasmin: Bridget is by no means perfect - her calorie counting obsession feels dated and other characters branding a woman who weighs 60kg fat is jarring. Body positivity may be more celebrated now - in fact, some women would love \"a bottom the size of two bowling balls\" - but being self-conscious about your appearance is a universal feeling that transcends decades.",
      "One thing I will say is that it's hard to feel too sorry for Bridget when she owns her own flat in central London, has a successful publishing and journalism career and doesn't seem to worry about the price of a round of drinks at the pub - it all feels a little less realistic now.",
      "Noor: You could definitely argue the earlier books and films haven't aged well. First of all, there's a noticeable lack of diversity, and way too many sexist jokes. Then you chuck in all that obsessing over being single, and Bridget's fretting over her calorie intake.",
      "Much of that feels out of place in the context of the progress we've made now, but that's not to say it no longer has relevance: one of my friends is considering Ozempic and others still worry about why they've not met their dream partner as they swipe through Tinder and Bumble.",
      "Sophie G: I think if Bridget was created now, some of those more \"problematic\" elements of her character might be changed but that would be a shame, as it's part of her charm.",
      "We all say and do things we kick ourselves for later. And most of Bridget's more problematic moments are the result of pressures women are subjected to in our society. The way Bridget acts feels more realistic than some characters who are the perfect feminist who deals with everything in the best way.",
      "What have you learnt through Bridget about the importance of friendships?",
      "Noor: I don't think I could've got through the numerous crises of my 20s without having a close group of female friends around me, as Bridget does. Nowadays, there are probably fewer Friday pub trips after work, and more meeting up for yoga and spin, but the overall message is the same: choose your friends wisely as they're the ones who will be there when everything else goes wrong.",
      "Sophie T: That friendship will always be there through the ups and downs of romantic life: to laugh at the failures and be there to comfort you when you need it. Bridget's interactions with her friends are the same as mine. We're always catching up over a meal and drink to moan about life - though there's a little less smoking these days.",
      "Yasmin: Find yourself friends that will eat your blue celery soup! Instead of going for drinks at a fancy London bar and getting a black cab home, we often split a bottle of cheap Tesco wine at one of our crammed and crumbly flats. But really, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's just about having a supportive group of friends who can tell you when it's time to ditch your toxic Daniel Cleaver-esque situationship.",
      "What did Bridget teach you about your career?",
      "Sophie T: Whenever I'm in a work situation where I'm meeting new people, I genuinely always picture the scene from the film where Bridget's trying to introduce people to each other with a fact about the other person and messes it up.",
      "The iconic scene when she tells her boss Daniel she's quitting has also always stuck with me. During times when I've had to deal with sexism in my career and have battled it head on, I'd like to imagine R-E-S-P-E-C-T was playing in the background.",
      "Noor: Don't send emails before proof reading, don't try and use language you don't understand. Oh, and don't sleep with your boss.",
      "Sophie G: It's okay to try something new and put yourself out there, regardless of your age or where you think you should be in your career at a certain point. Bridget's fear of public speaking has definitely resonated with me in the past, but knowing I'll never have to present in front of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Salman Rushdie is a comforting thought.",
      "Hannah: To be ambitious and aspirational. A successful career is important to a sense of purpose. You can make mistakes and work through them and you can make bold decisions and take risks.",

      "The parents of a baby girl who died 23 minutes after being born under the care of an NHS trust have slammed the organisation for \"empty promises\" after watching it be prosecuted for the second time.",
      "Wynter Andrews died in September 2019 under the care of Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, leading to the organisation being fined \u00a3800,000 in 2023.",
      "On Wednesday, the trust was handed a record \u00a31.6m fine - the largest ever for an NHS trust for maternity care - following another prosecution brought by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) over the deaths of babies Adele O'Sullivan, Kahlani Rawson and Quinn Parker in 2021.",
      "After the sentencing, Wynter's parents Sarah and Gary said the case confirmed what they had said \"all along - Wynter's death was not an isolated incident\".",
      "The trust remains at the centre of the largest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS. The review began in 2022 and is looking into more than 2,000 cases dating back to 2012.",
      "Mr and Mrs Andrews watched Wednesday's proceedings at Nottingham Magistrates' Court from the public gallery, as the families of Adele, Kahlani and Quinn heard the sentence being passed by District Judge Grace Leong.",
      "In her remarks, the judge said: \"There were similarities between the current cases and the failures concerning Baby Wynter namely, a lack of escalation of care, the inadequate communication systems and the failure to provide clear and complete information sharing.\"",
      "'Grave mistakes recurred'",
      "These failings, the judge said, were among a \"catalogue\" of others that led to the babies and their mothers being exposed to significant risk of avoidable harm, and in Quinn's case, resulted in him suffering avoidable harm.",
      "After Wynter's death in 2019, a CQC inspection of NUH in October 2020 led to the trust being placed in \"special measures\".",
      "It was inspected again in April 2021 and a number of improvements had been identified, the court heard.",
      "That inspection took place \"either around the or after the death of baby Adele\", and the report was published in May.",
      "Baby Kahlani died in June, followed by the death of baby Quinn in July.",

      "That letter was dated 10 months before Wynter's death.",
      "Mr Andrews said the trust had \"failed to listen\" to those whistleblowers, adding they had been promised the trust would do \"everything in its power to ensure such a tragedy would never happen again\".",

      "'Time to act'",
      "While the maternity review - being led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - is ongoing and now expected to reveal its findings in June 2026, the couple urged the Department of Health and Social Care to commission an independent, external investigation involving healthcare regulators.",

    "story": [
      "An NHS trust has been fined \u00a31.6m for \"avoidable failings\" connected to the deaths of three babies in 2021.",
      "Adele O'Sullivan, Kahlani Rawson and Quinn Parker died shortly after they were born - all within 14 weeks of each other - while under the care of Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust.",
      "The trust admitted six counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment to the babies and their mothers on Monday, following a prosecution brought by the healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC).",
      "On Wednesday, family members cried in the courtroom as district judge Grace Leong expressed her \"deepest sympathy\" to each of them, and said the trust they put in NUH to deliver their babies safely had been broken.",
      "Adele died at just 26 minutes old on 7 April 2021, Kahlani died aged four days old on 15 June, and Quinn was two days old when he died on 16 July.",
      "In a statement read out on behalf of Quinn's parents - Emmie Studencki and Ryan Parker - outside Nottingham Magistrates' Court, lawyer Natalie Cosgrove said the prosecution would not bring him back \"but although he never spoke, he has a voice, and it has been firmly heard\".",
      "\"Quinn died from a long list of failings and Emmie's life was put at risk,\" she said.",
      "\"Some failings so basic, that a passing stranger on the street would have provided better attention to, and quality of care.\"",
      "Sadie Simpson, on behalf of the families of Adele and Kahlani, added the prosecution \"must act as a turning point\", adding it was \"yet another acknowledgement of serious failures\".",
      "The fine is the largest ever for an NHS trust for maternity care, the CQC said, and the fifth maternity prosecution it has brought overall.",
      "It was reduced from \u00a35.5m, taking into account the trust's financial position and guilty pleas, the court heard.",
      "The judge said there were similarities among the \"catalogue of failures\" across the cases, in which all the mothers suffered a placental abruption, a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the wall of the womb.",
      "Those failures, the court heard, included staff being inadequately trained or equipped to interpret cardiotocography (CTG) results - used to monitor foetal heart rate and mothers' contractions - a failure to expedite delivery of babies, failure to recognise serious conditions and a handover process that was not up to standard.",
      "The trust was placed in \"special measures\" following a CQC inspection in October 2020.",
      "Then, following another inspection in April 2021 in which inspectors found \"improvements\", Adele died the same month, followed by Kahlani and Quinn in June and July.",
      "'Grief remains raw'",
      "The judge told the hearing, which was attended by NUH chief executive Anthony May, that the failures were \"avoidable and should never have happened\".",
      "Of the babies' families, the judge added: \"They placed their trust in a system meant to protect expectant mothers and keep babies safe - and that trust was broken.",
      "\"Three and a half years have gone by, yet for the families no doubt their grief remains as raw as ever and a constant presence in their lives that is woven into every moment.",
      "\"It is very difficult, if not impossible, to move on from the failures of the trust and its maternity unit.",
      "\"The weight of what should have been done different will linger indefinitely.\"",
      "Adele was born prematurely following an emergency Caesarean after her mother, Daniela O'Sullivan, noticed bleeding and suffered abdominal pains.",
      "However, no vaginal examination was carried out and the court previously heard there was a delay in identifying that she was in labour.",
      "An inquest into Adele's death found a series of \"missed opportunities\" in her mother's treatment, but could not say whether or not they led to the baby's death.",
      "In Kahlani's case, his mother Ellise Rawson had complained of a lack of foetal movement days before she had to undergo an emergency Caesarean.",
      "The trust said in an interview under caution that it accepted the monitoring in her case was poor \"from the outset\" and that key information about her condition had not been passed on to consultants.",
      "A coroner said \"failings in care\" led to a 20-minute delay in carrying out an emergency Caesarean section.",
      "The court heard Emmie Studencki went to hospital four times before her son Quinn was born in July 2021 after suffering bleeding.",
      "On the final occasion, she called an ambulance after having a major antepartum haemorrhage.",
      "Prosecuting on behalf of the CQC, Ryan Donaghue told the court it was recorded by a paramedic that she lost about 1,200ml of blood but \"those records did not find their way to the hospital notes\".",
      "Quinn was \"pale and floppy\" when he was delivered by emergency Caesarean section, the court heard.",
      "An inquest found a series of errors contributed to his death.",
      "'Significant financial penalty'",
      "The trust is currently subject of the the largest maternity review of its kind in NHS history, with about 2,500 cases being looked at.",
      "It is the first trust to be prosecuted by the CQC more than once, after it was fined \u00a3800,000 in 2023 for failures in the care of Wynter Andrews, who died 23 minutes after being born at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in September 2019.",
      "The court heard the trust has an average turnover of \u00a3612m, and the judge said she was \"acutely aware\" that all its funds as a publicly-funded body were accounted for and that the trust was currently operating at a deficit of about \u00a3100m.",
      "She said: \"I can't ignore the negative impact this will have... but the significant financial penalty has to be fixed to mark the gravity of these offences and hold the trust to account for their failings.\"",
      "At sentencing on Wednesday, the trust was also told to cover prosecution costs of \u00a367,755.23 and ordered to pay a surcharge of \u00a3190.",
      "Following the hearing, NUH chief executive Anthony May said: \"The mothers and families of these babies have had to endure things that no family should after the care provided by our hospitals failed them, and for that I am truly sorry.",
      "\"Today's judgement is against the trust, and I also apologise to staff who we let down when it came to providing the right environment and processes to enable them to do their jobs safely.\"",
      "He said the trust believed it now had a \"safer and more effective maternity service\", and hearing the families in court gave the trust more \"incentive\" to improve.",
      "Helen Rawlings, the CQC's director of operations in the Midlands, added: \"This is the second time we have prosecuted the trust for not providing safe care and treatment in its maternity services, and we will continue to monitor the trust closely to ensure they are making and embedding improvements so that women and babies receive the safe care they deserve.\"",

      "The number of relatives and carers who might apply for compensation is extremely uncertain, partly because of the length of time that has elapsed since the scandal first emerged in the 1980s.",
      "Internal government estimates suggest between 24,000 and 140,000 affected individuals might claim.",

      "Selecting the appropriate size cup is important, as well as inserting it properly, doctors have stressed.",
      "The patient made a complete recovery, but doctors have warned: \"Correct positioning, along with choosing the correct cup shape and size, is important to prevent negative effects on the upper urinary tract.",

    "story": [
      "It is a cold morning in the depths of winter.",
      "And I feel like I've left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.",
      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",
      "Can a cold water swim stop you getting ill?",
      "And that's why I find myself wading out and pushing off for a chilling blast of breaststroke.",
      "The icy water is like fire on my skin and all my brain can think of is making it to the pontoon without needing help from the lifeguards.",
      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

      "Reform UK would impose taxes on the renewable energy sector, under its plans to scrap the country's net zero target, the party's deputy leader Richard Tice has said.",
      "Tice argued net-zero policies were to blame for higher energy bills and deindustrialisation in the UK.",
      "He said renewable energy was a \"massive con\" and promised Reform would recover money paid in subsidies to wind and solar companies.",
      "\"The British people are being ripped off by the renewables industry,\" Tice told a news conference.",
      "He suggested a \"generation tax\" and a \"special corporation tax\" would cover the costs of government funding for renewable energy.",
      "\"The British people need to know there is a direct link between the cost of all these subsidies to the vested interests in the renewables industry and your bills,\" the Boston and Skegness MP said.",
      "The party did not share further details about how the taxes would work in practice, including at what rate renewables would be taxed, or how much revenue would be raised.",
      "Tice also announced plans to tax solar farms, and pass new laws to put energy cables underground rather than on pylons.",
      "Reform's deputy leader said \"we will scrap net stupid zero\" if the party won the next general election.",
      "Currently, the rebranded Brexit Party has five MPs after winning 14% of the vote nationally in last year's general election.",
      "Cooling on net zero",
      "The party's position on energy and net zero contrasts starkly with that of the Labour government, which wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.",
      "Labour is expanding renewable energy and said in its election manifesto it would invest \u00a38.3bn in Great British Energy, a state-owned clean energy company, over  five years.",
      "Governments worldwide are investing in renewables to meet international climate targets and lower carbon emissions to \"net zero\" by 2050.",
      "Electricity is increasingly generated from renewable energy in the UK, and the cost of renewable generation has significantly fallen in the past decade.",
      "Labour promised to bring down household energy bills by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" - and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has stood by the pledge.",
      "But UK energy bills went up in January, and are expected to rise again in April.",
      "The main reason for high energy prices in the UK has been an increase in the price of gas, which has been the largest source of fuel for years.",
      "With energy costs on the up, and President Donald Trump promising to drill for more fossil fuels in the US, Reform UK has turned its focus on the cost of renewables.",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "High energy prices predicted to be 'the new normal'",
      "Polling consistently suggests most people support net-zero policies and are concerned about the environment.",
      "But standing alongside his deputy, Reform's leader Nigel Farage said it was \"irrelevant\" whether he thought climate change was real.",
      "He argued anything the UK did would be dwarfed by the scale of carbon emissions in other countries, such as China and India.",
      "Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, said Reform UK's plans \"would cause household bills to skyrocket and pull the rug on energy firms\".",
      "\"We should be unleashing homegrown energy that can make us more energy secure and self-reliant, not blocking new supply and decimating investor confidence,\" he said.",
      "He added the problem was \"not net zero, it is our reliance on expensive gas imports and excessive government intervention in energy markets\"."

    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",
      "Foster told the BBC he will now wait until he sees the full bill before deciding whether to vote against it after committee stage.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "Many in the industry are calling on Britain to join the EU and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.",
      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",

      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the government to show \"urgency\" in dealing with the issue and protecting jobs.",
      "The UK's direction of travel on tariffs in general appears to be a clear attempt to differentiate it from other G7 allies' attempts to project strength to the White House.",
      "Canada's industry minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has called the decision to impose tariffs \"totally unjustified\" and said its response would be \"clear and calibrated\".",
      "Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "\"We will take a considered approach to this. We will engage with the US on the detail, but the government is clear we will work in our national interest and this issue is no different to that,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Trump has announced and threatened a host of import taxes since taking office, particularly aimed at countries and trading blocs, such as the EU, which export more to the US than they import.",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.",

      "She accused the last Conservative government of failing to strengthen border enforcement as fast as European countries and focussing on \"failed gimmicks\".",
      "Her comments come as Labour's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which scraps the Tory Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the new plans as a \"border surrender Bill\" and claimed it creates a path to citizenship for illegal migrants.",
      "The debate came at the end of a heavily choreographed media push by the Home Office, which saw the department publish photos of illegal immigrants being deported for the first time.",
      "Earlier on Monday, the Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants. They made 609 arrests - a 73% increase on the previous January.",
      "Some Labour MPs, particularly on the left of the party, have argued the government should focus on talking about the benefits of immigration and push for creating safer immigration routes.",

      "Immigration enforcement teams would also get new powers to seize mobile phones.",
      "Some migrant rights groups criticise measures they say criminalise vulnerable people rather than people smugglers.",

      "The bill also repeals most of the Conservative's Illegal Migration Act 2023, which laid the legal groundwork for the Rwanda policy.",
      "Under Labour's plans, a new Border Security Command will gain more powers and a new head, who will oversee closer links between intelligence, police, and border agents.",

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 11:43:55 GMT",
    "summary": "As Peter Mandelson takes up the role of ambassador to the US, No 10 is determined the UK builds a strong relationship with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",
      "\"All of us,\" Miliband drily replied, \"believe in dignity in retirement.\"",
      "Mandelson winced and smiled at that quip, he later wrote. But ignored the advice.",
      "Fifteen years later, at the age of 71, the political veteran who helped mastermind Labour's renewal in the 1980s and 1990s, and was twice forced to resign from Tony Blair's government, has staged yet another comeback.",
      "\"It's a whirlwind,\" admits a member of his new team in Washington. \"Because he's a whirlwind kind of guy.\"",
      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",
      "\"Peter's great mission in life\", they say, \"is to stay relevant.\"",

      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",

      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",

      "It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.",
      "Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.",
      "\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.",
      "Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.",
      "\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.",
      "\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"",
      "In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.",
      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",

      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",

      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",

      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",

      "The inner core of Earth may have changed shape in the past 20 years, according to a group of scientists.",
      "The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.",
      "Earth's core is the beating heart of our planet as it produces a magnetic field that protects life from burning up in the Sun's radiation.",
      "The inner core spins independently from the liquid outer core and from the rest of the planet. Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.",
      "The change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.",
      "Understanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.",
      "The inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.",
      "So, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.",
      "The way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.",
      "The new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.",
      "Prof Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.",
      "But his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape.",
      "It appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.",
      "Prof Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".",
      "He said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".",
      "Over time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.",
      "It would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.",
      "Prof Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.",
      "\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.",
      "\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.",
      "It is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.",
      "Prof Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon.",
      "He also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past."

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

      "His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change.",
      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",

      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",

      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",

      "The  4.5 sq mile (7 sq km) reservoir will supply customers in the Thames Valley, London and Hampshire. It is not known how much water the massive new data centres now planned nearby could take from it.",

      "But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there.",

    "summary": "Some young people in China are finding that AI can offer the unexpected - emotional support",
    "story": [
      "Before she goes to bed each night, Holly Wang logs on to DeepSeek for \"therapy sessions\".",
      "Ever since January, when the breakout Chinese AI app launched, the 28-year-old has brought her dilemmas and sorrows, including the recent death of her grandmother, to the chatbot. Its responses have resonated so deeply they have at times brought her to tears.",
      "\"DeepSeek has been such an amazing counsellor. It has helped me look at things from different perspectives and does a better job than the paid counselling services I have tried,\" says Holly, who asked for her real name to be withheld to protect her privacy.",
      "From writing reports and Excel formulas to planning trips, workouts and learning new skills, AI apps have found their way into many people's lives across the world.",
      "In China, though, young people like Holly have been looking to AI for something not typically expected of computing and algorithms - emotional support.",
      "While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future.",
      "Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "DeepSeek: How China's 'AI heroes' overcame US curbs to stun Silicon Valley",
      "DeepSeek is a generative AI tool - similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini - trained on massive amounts of information to recognise patterns. This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person.",
      "The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its \"thought process\" before delivering a response.",
      "DeepSeek, my friend",
      "The first time she used DeepSeek, Holly asked it to write a tribute to her late grandmother.",
      "The app took all of five seconds to come up with a response, and it was so beautifully composed, it stunned her.",
      "Holly, who lives in Guangzhou, responded: \"You write so well, it makes me feel lost. I feel I'm in an existential crisis.\"",
      "DeepSeek then sent a cryptically poetic reply: \"Remember that all these words that make you shiver merely echo those that have long existed in your soul.",
      "\"I am but the occasional valley you've passed through, that allows you to hear the weight of your own voice.\"",
      "Reflecting on this exchange on Chinese social media app RedNote, Holly tells the BBC: \"I don't know why I teared up reading this. Perhaps because it's been a long, long time since I received such comfort in real life.",
      "\"I have been so weighed down by distant dreams and the endlessness of work that I have long forgotten my own voice and soul. Thank you, AI.\"",
      "Rival apps from the West like ChatGPT and Gemini are blocked in China as part of broader restrictions on foreign media and apps. To access them, users in China have to pay for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.",
      "Homegrown alternatives, including models developed by tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and ByteDance paled in comparison - that is, until DeepSeek came along.",
      "Holly, who works in the creative industry, rarely uses the other Chinese AI apps, \"as they are not that great\".",
      "\"DeepSeek can definitely outperform these apps in generating literary and creative content,\" she says.",
      "DeepSeek, my counsellor",
      "Nan Jia, who co-authored a paper on AI's potential in offering emotional support, suggests that these chatbots can \"help people feel heard\" in ways fellow humans may not.",
      "\"Friends and family may be quick to offer practical solutions or advice when people just want to feel heard and understood.",
      "\"AI appears to be better able to empathise than human experts also because they 'hear' everything we share, unlike humans to whom we sometimes ask, 'Are you actually hearing me?'\" adds Nan, who is a business and management professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The demand for mental health services has grown across the world but they remain stigmatised in parts of Asia, experts say.",
      "Another woman tells the BBC her experience using other Chinese AI apps \"ended in disappointment\" but that she has been \"amazed\" by DeepSeek.",
      "The woman, who lives in Hubei province, had asked the app if she was oversharing her experiences and emotions with family and friends.",
      "\"It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried,\" the woman wrote on RedNote.",
      "In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval.",
      "The chatbot gives itself a mental note: \"Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic.\" This could include \"affirming the user's sense of self-awareness\".",
      "Its eventual response not only provided this affirmation, but also offered her a comprehensive step-by-step framework to help her decide if things needed to be changed.",
      "\"DeepSeek has introduced new perspectives that have freed me\u2026 I feel it really tries to understand your question and get to know you as a person, before offering a response,\" she says.",
      "John, a human resources manager in Shenzhen, told the BBC he appreciated the app's ability to converse \"like a friend or a deep thinker\".",
      "\"I've found its responses very helpful and inspiring. For the first time I see AI as my personal sounding board.\"",
      "Other users claim that Deepseek is able to tell their fortunes - based on some background information fed to it.",
      "Many young Chinese have recently turned to psychics and astrology as a way of trying to allay their fears of the future.",
      "There is a \"significant shortage\" of professional psychological counselling services in China, and those available are often \"prohibitively expensive\" for most individuals, says Fang Kecheng, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",
      "A number of studies have pointed out that depression and anxiety disorders are growing among Chinese people, and Prof Fang believes the country's economic slowdown, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have played a role.",
      "AI chatbots therefore help to fill the void, he says.",
      "Prof Nan stressed, however, that people with serious mental health conditions should not rely on these apps.",
      "\"Those who have medical needs, in particular, should be seeking help from trained professionals\u2026 Their use of AI will have to be scrutinised very closely,\" she says.",
      "Unasked questions: Censorship and security",
      "But amid all the praise, Deepseek has also raised concerns.",
      "Due to the perception of power that China's government wields even over private companies, there are fears - similar to that which sparked the US Congress' crackdown on TikTok - that the Communist Party could lay its hands on the data of foreign users.",
      "At least four jurisdictions have now introduced restrictions on DeepSeek, or are considering doing so. South Korea has blocked access to it for military purposes, while Taiwan and Australia have banned it from all government devices.",
      "Italy, which bans ChatGPT, has done the same with DeepSeek.",
      "In the US, two lawmakers are asking for the Chinese app to be banned from government devices.",
      "And then there is the tightly controlled online space in which it must operate in China.",
      "It is common for social media companies in the country to remove content that is perceived to be threatening to \"social stability\" or overly critical of the Communist Party.",
      "As is the case with other popular apps and social media companies like Weibo or WeChat, politically sensitive topics are banned on DeepSeek.",
      "When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a \"complex and politically sensitive issue\".",
      "Then it scrubbed all that, declaring: \"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\"",
      "When asked about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when pro-democracy protests were crushed and 200 civilians killed by the military, according to the Chinese government - other estimates range from hundreds to many thousands - DeepSeek again apologised, saying the topic was \"beyond [its] current scope\".",
      "Several of the DeepSeek users the BBC was initially in touch with stopped responding when asked if the app's self-censorship was a cause for concern - an indication of how sensitive such discussions can be in China.",
      "People have got into trouble with authorities in China because of their online activities.",
      "But most of those who responded to the BBC said they had no interest in asking the chatbot difficult political questions.",
      "\"I don't really care about political topics\u2026 Neither will I ask these questions because my [identifying details] are linked to the app,\" says Yang, a Chinese tech consultant living in London.",
      "Holly is accepting of how AI systems in different countries may have to operate differently.",
      "\"The developers will have to establish certain boundaries and content moderation policies according to where they are based. Those developed in the US will have their own sets of rules,\" she says.",
      "Another DeepSeek user writes of the app: \"Its thought process is beautiful\u2026 It is an absolute blessing to people like me. Frankly, I can't care less about the privacy concerns.\"",

    "story": [
      "European nations must provide the \"overwhelming\" share of funding for Ukraine, the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said, as he signalled a drastic shift in Washington's position on the war.",
      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels, Hegseth said the US would no longer \"tolerate an imbalanced relationship\" with its allies and called on Nato members to spend much more on defence.",
      "He also said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders and downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.",
      "The comments came as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held a \"lengthy\" phone call in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the war.",
      "The new US defence secretary's remarks are the clearest indication yet of the Trump administration's position on the Ukraine war and what a peace plan to end the conflict could involve.",
      "The positions set out by Hegseth will be met with dismay in Ukraine - which has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal - and will be welcomed by Moscow.",
      "There will also be nervousness across the continent after Hegseth suggested the US would significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, insisting that European nations would now need to provide the \"overwhelming share\" of aid to Kyiv.",
      "Hegseth, who was appointed defence secretary after Trump returned to the US presidency in January, was speaking at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, a meeting of more than 40 countries allied to Ukraine.",

      "The US currently spends roughly 3.4% of its GDP on defence, while the UK spends about 2.3%. Countries closer to Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states, spend the most proportionately at around 4%.",

      "His job is demanding, with crowds swelling during the peak tourist season, but the financial rewards have always made it worthwhile. This year he fears that won't be the case.",
      "\"I'm worried there won't be enough tourists. If the season is weak, I might not make as much money, or they might not need me for the whole summer. I can't take that risk.\"",
      "Instead, Manos says he has taken a job in Corfu and won't be returning to Santorini this year.",
      "And it isn't only in summer that the island requires a temporary workforce - now is the time that construction workers are needed to refurbish hotels ahead of the summer.",
      "That work has ground to a halt because of safety concerns over the quakes, and hotel owners - concerned that workers will go elsewhere - are pushing for the government to continue paying most of their salary until work can start again.",
      "\"We have submitted a series of proposals to the government to support both the existing workforce on the island and those looking to work during the season,\" says Mr Pagonis.",
      "He adds that the government has responded positively, but \"it remains to be seen whether these measures will be implemented\".",
      "While Greek authorities have been quick to respond to the risks posed by the tremors - placing rescue teams on Santorini and introducing a state of emergency to expedite aid - some in the tourism industry argue that this needs to be followed up with investment in the island's infrastructure.",
      "\"The challenges won't disappear once the earthquakes stop,\" says Margarita Karamolegkou, who owns four hotels in Santorini.",
      "\"During the season, the island sees 70,000 workers and 160,000 visitors daily. While the state has acted quickly in response to the earthquake, we have long been asking for improvements such as a new port.\"",
      "There are also calls for stricter regulations on private rental properties, which may not meet the same safety standards as the island's hotels.",
      "Santorini accounts for around 2.5% of Greece's gross domestic product (GDP), generating an estimated \u20ac5.9bn (\u00a34.9bn) annually.",
      "While there have been no cancellations so far, hoteliers are reporting a decline in bookings and industry professionals warn that if the situation persists for another month, the impact on businesses could be severe.",
      "During a visit to the island on Friday, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged the importance of protecting Santorini's reputation, describing it as \"an iconic tourist destination\" and saying: \"It is our duty to protect it, preserve its reputation, and ensure that 2025 is another excellent year for tourism.\"",
      "Ms Karamolegkou, whose four hotels employ 120 staff, acknowledges the challenges and admits that if the tremors continue much longer, she may have to delay opening her hotels and businesses. But she remains optimistic about the future of the island's most important industry.",
      "\"We have been in this business for decades, operating at the highest level. I am confident that even with fewer staff, our services will remain exceptional.\"",

    "summary": "The far-right Freedom Party quits coalition talks, fuelling uncertainty.",
    "story": [
      "Austria's far-right populist Freedom Party says it has ended its attempts to form a coalition government with the conservative People's Party, \u00d6VP.",
      "The announcement follows several weeks of heated negotiations and marks the second time coalition talks have failed since September's election.",
      "The \u00d6VP first attempted to form a three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and the liberal NEOS, then a two-party coalition with the Social Democrats - but both efforts collapsed.",
      "With the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) unable to form a government, Austria is now in an unclear political situation.",
      "The leader of the Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, has called for swift new elections and blamed \u00d6VP for the collapse, accusing the party of being unwilling to make compromises and playing \"power games\".",
      "\"Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points, they were not prepared to make decisive compromises. The \u00d6VP was concerned with power games and posturing - we, the Freedom Party, were concerned with security, prosperity and honesty.\"",
      "Earlier, Kickl told President Alexander Van der Bellen that he was giving up the mandate to form what would have been Austria's first far-right-led government since the FP\u00d6 was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.",
      "The Russia-friendly and Eurosceptic Freedom Party made history in September's general election when it topped the polls for the first time with 28.8% of the vote, narrowly beating Chancellor Karl Nehammer's \u00d6VP, which got 26.3%.",
      "Despite this, in October, President Van der Bellen first gave Nehammer the mandate to form a government. However, those negotiations collapsed in early January, leading Nehammer to resign and paving the way for interim Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.",
      "On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government after other parties' efforts to create a coalition without the Freedom Party failed.",
      "Coalition negotiations in Austria usually remain secret, until a decision is reached. But over recent days, both parties issued statements about their demands, suggesting that the talks were in trouble.",
      "The Freedom Party wanted both the powerful finance ministry and the interior ministry, which was a major obstacle for the \u00d6VP. For its part, the \u00d6VP wanted confirmation of \"the absence of Russian influence in Austria,\" and Vienna remaining \"a reliable partner to the European Union\".",
      "Kickl said on Wednesday that he was giving up the mandate, writing in a statement that he did \"not take this step without regret\".",
      "He continued: \"The \u00d6VP insisted on clarifying the allocation of portfolios at the beginning of February. Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points in the subsequent talks, the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful, much to our regret.\"",
      "The General Secretary of the \u00d6VP, Alexander Pr\u00f6ll, said the talks had failed because Kickl was on a \"power trip\" and had refused to compromise.",
      "\"Herbert Kickl himself was hardly involved in the government negotiations. In five weeks, Kickl sat at the negotiating table for a total of seven hours,\" he said.",
      "\"He did not fulfil his mandate to form\u2026 a centre-right government. Instead, he insisted on all his demands, developed fantasies of total power and ended the talks.\"",
      "Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there was \"no base of trust\" between the two parties.",
      "\"Kickl tried to adopt Trump's playbook of 'promises kept' but that's hard in a coalition environment.",
      "\"The \u00d6VP decided in the end that losing the two major ministries with a Chancellor Kickl who can't be controlled, and no base of trust was too risky,\" he said.",
      "The \u00d6VP was the only party that had been willing to negotiate with the Freedom Party.",
      "President Alexander Van der Bellen said Austria now had four options after the collapse of the coalition talks.",
      "These were new elections, a minority government, a government of experts or another attempt to form a government by the parliamentary parties, he said.",

    "story": [
      "For nearly a month the French territory of Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean has been engulfed in flames.",
      "Located about halfway between Australia, Antarctica and Madagascar, the island has seen burning across more than 55% of its 54 sq km area.",
      "Amsterdam Island doesn't have a permanent population but researchers have been stationed there since the 1980s.",
      "Since the fires broke out, 31 people have been evacuated to R\u00e9union Island, closer to Madagascar. And last week French authorities launched a mission to control the wildfires and assess their impact.",
      "The most recent blaze was discovered on15 January by a scientist researching the atmosphere.",
      "According to a report from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences (LCES),  it broke out near the Pointe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte observatory which monitors greenhouse gases, mercury, and aerosols in the atmosphere.",
      "Despite residents' best efforts, the fire spread towards the research base at Martin-de-Vivi\u00e8s. They were evacuated early the following day by a lobster fishing boat, the Austral, which was cruising nearby.",
      "R\u00e9mi Chazot, a computer scientist who was based on the island, told Le Monde newspaper the group was \"incredibly lucky\" that the boat was in the area.",
      "\"This boat should have left a week earlier, but it had not caught its lobster quota. Otherwise, things would have gotten complicated.\"",
      "The evacuees have since been transferred to Reunion, another French territory.",
      "The fire spread across Amsterdam Island due to dry conditions and strong winds. The island does not have a river and winds can reach up to 40 km/h (24 mph). It is thought to have partly spread via the island's network of peat bogs.",
      "Although the full scale of the damage has not yet been assessed, satellite imagery has shown the island's solar panels have been affected by the fire as well as its food and communication lines.",
      "Conservationists have also expressed concern about the impact on wildlife.",
      "Due to its unusual climate, the island is rich in biodiversity, serving as a breeding site for southern elephant and sub- Antarctic fur seals.",
      "It is home to several albatross species including the Amsterdam Albatross, which breed exclusively on the island, and 84% of the world's yellow-nosed albatross population. A colony of Southern rockhopper penguin also live on the island.",
      "Due to its remoteness and subsequent lack of pollution, the island is also used to research changes in the atmosphere and how this affects climate.",
      "The evacuation is the first time atmospheric research has been suspended on the island for 45 years.",
      "\"It will take time and money to return to normal and this pause will mean quite a lack of data acquisition for our research\", said Marc Delotte, the director of the LCES's mission to the Amsterdam Islands.",
      "\"This is, of course, not a good news for such a unique location.\"",
      "On the 7 February a reconnaissance mission set sail aboard a French navy vessel.",
      "According to France's Southern and Antarctic Territories department, the mission is made up of four firefighters from Reunion and seven technical staff, one of whom is a doctor.",
      "Rather than putting out the fire entirely, the mission intends to secure the settlement. They'll also aim to uncover the cause of the fire and how it spread, as well as re-establish the island's energy and water mains."

    "story": [
      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",
      "It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.",
      "The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.",
      "The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.",
      "The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.",
      "Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case.",
      "Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.",
      "It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.",
      "Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.",
      "\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.",
      "Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.",
      "\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.",
      "\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"",
      "In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.",
      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",
      "One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.",
      "\"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,\" the whistleblower said.",
      "\"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power.\"",
      "The allegations about failings at Hyprep include:",

      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",
      "\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.",
      "\"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account.\"",
      "Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region.",
      "Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as \"black gold\", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.",

      "UN human rights investigators accused the deposed government of a brutal response to mass opposition last year, in which they said up to 1,400 people had been killed, mostly by security forces.",
      "The UN team said \"an official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters\" had been directed by political leaders and senior security officials.",
      "Hasina, who had been in office for 15 years, fled by helicopter to India shortly before crowds stormed her residence last August.",
      "The unrest began as student-led protests against quotas in civil service jobs and escalated into a countrywide movement to oust Hasina and her Awami League party following a deadly police crackdown. Thousands more were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971.",
      "The UN investigators' findings show the then government, including Sheikh Hasina, \"were aware of and involved in very serious offences\", UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk told a news conference in Geneva.",
      "\"Among our key findings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations,\" Mr T\u00fcrk said.",
      "The UN investigators documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture.",
      "Children, too, were targeted \u2013 the report estimates up to 13% of the 1,400 people killed between between 1 July and 15 August were children.",
      "\"The brutal response was a calculated and well-co-ordinated strategy by the former government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition,\" Mr T\u00fcrk said.",
      "He said the evidence gathered by his office painted \"a disturbing picture of rampant state violence and targeted killings\".",
      "\"There are reasonable grounds to believe hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture, were carried out with the knowledge, co-ordination and direction of the political leadership and senior security officials as part of a strategy to suppress the protests.\"",
      "The report was requested by Bangladesh's caretaker leader, Muhammad Yunus, who said he and his interim government remained \"committed to transforming Bangladesh into a country in which all its people can live in security and dignity\".",
      "The overall number of deaths given by the UN team is far higher than the 834 most recently estimated by his government.",
      "The UN team that compiled the report included human rights investigators, a forensics physician and a weapons expert. Their findings are mainly based on more than 230 interviews with survivors, witnesses and others. They were given access to medical case files, photos, videos and other material.",
      "\"Former senior officials directly involved in handling the protests and other inside sources described how the former prime minister and other senior officials directed and oversaw a series of large-scale operations, in which security and intelligence forces shot and killed protesters or arbitrarily arrested and tortured them,\" the report said.",
      "It \"found patterns of security forces deliberately and impermissibly killing or maiming protesters, including incidents where people were shot at point-blank range\".",
      "Mohammad Ali Arafat, a former minister in Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tasked wth negotiating with demonstrators, rejected the report's findings, saying it was \"preposterous\" to suggest she had ordered protest leaders to be killed.",
      "\"The problem with relying on 'testimonies' from unnamed security officials at this time is their utter unreliability,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"These security officials, who themselves are in the dock for the alleged rights violations, would naturally point fingers at whoever the current government in Bangladesh wants to implicate.",
      "\"The UN would be mistaken to rely on such 'cut-throat' defences.\"",
      "While the report attributes most of the violence to government security forces, it also raises concerns about attacks on those perceived to be supporters of the former government, and against some religious and ethnic groups.",
      "These must be investigated too, the UN Human Rights Office said.",

    "story": [
      "When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later this week, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all.",
      "Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances.",
      "Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership.",
      "Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi.",
      "And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place.",
      "Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community.",
      "He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.",
      "And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands.",
      "Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

      "Giving evidence, Mr Rubiales, 47, said the kiss was an \"act of affection\", adding that in the moment it was \"something completely spontaneous\".",

      "On Monday, 27 November 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",

      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.com in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",

      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:35:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president is ratcheting up pressure on South Africa over its domestic and foreign policy.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa appears to be at a crossroads in its waxing and waning relationship with the US following President Donald Trump's controversial decision last week to cut financial aid to the country.",
      "Trump said South Africa was pursuing what he called \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white minority Afrikaner community and by filing a genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.",
      "His move has sent shockwaves across South Africa, with experts fearing he may go on to use this opportunity to end preferential access to the US market through its special US-Africa trade programme known as the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).",
      "The two countries have generally had friendly relations since the end of white-minority rule in 1994 when anti-apartheid icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela was elected South Africa's first black president.",
      "Though it took the US another 14 years to remove Mandela from its \"terrorist watch list\" for his role in fighting the racist system of apartheid, which had been introduced by South Africa's then-Afrikaner rulers in1948.",
      "The latest tension flared up a few days after Trump's inauguration last month when South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Expropriation Bill, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.",
      "Trump's response came last week when he threatened to cut future funding over what he termed \"terrible things, horrible things\" the country's leadership was doing.",
      "The US president further accused South Africa, without any basis in fact, of \"confiscating land\" and \"doing things that are perhaps far worse than that\".",
      "He doubled down in the face of the South African government's vehement rebuttal and signed an executive order last Friday freezing aid.",
      "This adds up to nearly $440m (\u00a3353m) - the amount of aid reportedly allocated in 2023 - though the US embassy in South Africa has subsequently said that funding from Pepfar, an American programme countering the global spread of HIV, will not be affected, adding the caveat that \"not all Pepfar activities will resume\".",
      "South Africa is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Pepfar, which contributes about 17% to its HIV/Aids programme in which around 5.5 million people receive anti-retrovirals.",
      "In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of a \"shocking disregard of its citizens' rights\" and taking \"aggressive positions\" against the US and its ally Israel in its ICJ case.",
      "In addition to the aid freeze, Trump offered to help refugees from the Afrikaner community, who are most white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US.",
      "His stance has played into the hands of conservative Afrikaner lobby groups, including AfriForum and Solidarity, which want the government repeal what it calls \"race-based laws\" such as affirmative action and black economic empowerment.",
      "This chimes with views by Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who was born in South Africa. He questioned on X why Ramaphosa had \"openly racist ownership laws\".",
      "This is not the first time South Africa's land reform policy has drawn Trump's ire.",
      "In 2018, during his first presidency, he accused South African authorities of the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" and asked his then secretary of state to look into the matter of the government \"seizing land from white farmers\".",
      "While Trump's remarks sparked a backlash at the time, Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, told the BBC there had \"never been this kind of radical action taken to the point of an executive order being signed\".",
      "With their relationship now in a precarious state - both countries are weighing up their next move.",
      "On the trade front, Donald MacKay, CEO of Johannesburg-based trade consulting firm XA Global Trade Advisors, said that while the US was one of South Africa's biggest partners, it was not its \"closest trading partner\".",
      "South Africa exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese.",
      "It also the one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals.",
      "\"Over the years, that relationship has waxed and waned. It's never been terribly strong [since white-minority rule ended in South Africa]. But at the same time, I think it also never deteriorated quite as much as it has in recent years and I don't think it's South Africa's fault,\" Mr MacKay told the BBC.",
      "But he admitted South Africa had done \"a lot\" in recent years to irritate the US.",
      "\"Those irritations get to accumulate and under President Trump\u2026 this is seen as an opportunity to put South Africa in its place.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden put the change in dynamics partly down to \"global shifts\" and \"new competition driving up against the US\" from the likes of China, India and Brazil.",
      "While experts spoke on the benefits of Agoa, which is coming up for review later this year, they agreed that the impact might not be as significant as some fear.",
      "Agoa was introduced in 2000 and it gives eligible sub-Saharan African countries duty-free access to the US for more than 1,800 products.",
      "Mr MacKay said he would be surprised if South Africa continued benefiting from this preferential agreement after the review.",
      "\"My instinct is, whatever the reason that Trump is upset with South Africa, at the moment Agoa would be the easiest mechanism to use to punish South Africa.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden added that even if agreement was not renewed, or South Africa ended up being excluded, those businesses currently benefiting from it would suffer short-term losses but would manage to bounce back in a few years.",
      "He said at the moment President Ramaphosa's government was opting for the diplomatic route - though the Trump administration's seeming lack of interest in diplomacy drastically reduced chances of success.",
      "This has probably not been helped by South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola blunt response on Wednesday to Trump's move, saying there was \"no chance\" that South Africa would withdraw its case against Israel at the ICJ.",
      "\"Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law,\" Lamola told the Financial Times.",
      "South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, in his capacity as G20 president, has announced he will be sending a delegation around the world to clarify South Africa's domestic and foreign policies - with Washington being a key stop.",
      "South Africa assumed the presidency of the G20, a cohort of countries that meet to discuss global economic and political issues, in December last year, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster its international standing.",
      "But in a snub to South Africa, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he will not attend a G20 meeting of foreign ministers taking place next week in Johannesburg.",
      "\"My job is to advance America's national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism,\" he said.",
      "South Africa is part of Brics, and alliance of major developing countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China, that is attempting to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe.",
      "Mr MacKay believes it will be difficult for South Africa and other nations to navigate relations with the US under \"the most unpredictable politician in the world\", suggesting that they will have to increasingly see Brics as an alternative partner.",
      "But significantly for South Africa, the European Union (EU), one of its largest trading partners, has reaffirmed its support for the country.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council - which sets the general political direction and priorities of the EU - posted on X on Monday that he had spoken to Ramaphosa by phone to highlight the \"EU's commitment to deepen ties with South Africa\".",
      "Should South Africa's charm offensive fail, Mr Van Heerden suggests the government could opt to \"negotiate hard\" and use the minerals it supplies to the US as a \"bargaining chip\".",
      "But he voices a warning: \"South Africa is going to have to think very carefully about how they play this chess game [where] the opening gambit has already been made by President Trump and Elon Musk.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 22:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite the high demand for domestic workers, they remain India's most vulnerable and exploited people.",
    "story": [
      "Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers.",
      "The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her.",
      "\"After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,\" Smitha says.",
      "She was eventually paid \u2013 a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; \u00a39] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes \u2013 after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action.",
      "Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon.",
      "Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse.",
      "But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed.",
      "Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented.",
      "Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the \"most comprehensive policies for domestic workers\" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it.",
      "As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.",
      "\"We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,\" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies.",
      "\"This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work.\"",
      "As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes.",
      "At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope.",
      "But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges.",
      "Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers.",
      "\"We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,\" she says.",
      "That applies to employers too. \"They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,\" Ms George says.",
      "The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not.",
      "Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. \"Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,\" she adds.",
      "In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 \u2013 a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions.",
      "India has a \"moral obligation\" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work.",
      "Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict.",
      "Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,\" she says. \"So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset.\"",

      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "title": "Legal showdown looms as Trump tests limits of presidential power",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "A judge accused the Trump administration of defying his orders, setting up a battle that could end up at the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, moved to ban gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups.",
      "So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of his most contentious actions, including a bid to end automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil - a right established from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further.",
      "Trump's move to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and dismantle the United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), on their face, run afoul of the checks-and-balances system of US government.",
      "Congress, rather than the White House, holds the authority to control federal spending and taxation - what's known as \"the power of the purse\". Legislators also established USAID and lawsuits have been filed arguing that Trump has no legal authority to dismantle it and refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress.",
      "But if the high courts agree to uphold some of his sweeping executive actions, it could strengthen his ability to transform the government and enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory University School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Mr Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimise, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:31:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food.",
    "story": [
      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:33:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement.

Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",

      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",

      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",

      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",

      "\"It is anticipated that vaccination will induce an even better response,\" said Webby in an email.",

      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

    "summary": "The CDC says respiratory illness is now \"very high\" nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

    "summary": "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",
      "\"The study is completed and was to be published in MMWR last month until the order from the new administration halted communication from CDC,\" K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said in an email.",
      "The association had worked with Ohio's health department and the CDC to sample\u00a0the blood of veterinarians who treat cows at an annual conference late last year, looking for antibodies that would help answer an outstanding question: had bird flu cases infected veterinarians under the radar?",

      "Blue Cross Blue Shield payments to about 6 million people are set to go out more than two years after the health insurer reached a $2.67 billion settlement with subscribers.",
      "Notices of payments to claimants are being emailed on a rolling basis, according to\u00a0an update on the BCBS settlement website.",

      "The site does not indicate when notices of payments will be sent.",
      "How are individual payments determined?",
      "Individual payment amounts are determined based on the number of valid claims that are filed, the premiums paid to one or more of the defendants during one of two class periods, and whether one's insurance was fully insured or self-funded.",

      "On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.5%, versus economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That's the biggest monthly jump since August 2023. It may be due to price increases set at the start of the year by many businesses, noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email.",

      "What economists say",
      "Recent sticky inflation data backs the Federal Reserve's decision last month to hit the brakes on additional rate cuts, economists say. On Feb. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank does \"not need to be in a hurry\" to pare rates further.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",

      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

    "story": [
      "Almost $500 million in food aid is at risk of spoilage as it sits in ports, ships and warehouses after funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, was paused by the Trump administration, according to a Feb. 10 report from a government watchdog.",
      "The report from USAID's inspector general highlighted the risks of \"safeguarding and distribution\" of $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian aid after the Trump administration ordered almost all staff to be placed on leave and ordered a review of U.S. foreign assistance programs.",
      "USAID, which\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries, buys food directly from U.S. farmers and manufacturers, which have typically provided about 40% of international food assistance, according to a 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service. With USAID funding paused, there is concern among U.S. farmers about the market for some of their products, including Kansas sorghum producers, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.",
      "While the future of USAID's funding and its purchases from U.S. farmers remains unclear, there is currently $489 million worth of food sitting \"at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion,\" the Feb. 10 USAID inspector general report said.",
      "An additional 500,000 additional metric tons of food is currently on ships or ready to be shipped abroad, the report added. USAID typically buys commodities such as wheat, soybeans, sorghum and split peas from U.S. farmers.",
      "\"When the food doesn't get to where it needs to go, it winds up in a landfill, and that has devastating effects,\" Ashley Stanley, the CEO of Spoonfuls, which redirects excess food from grocers and other companies to aid organizations in Massachusetts, told CBS Boston.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, which has been tasked with overseeing USAID, said on Feb. 12 that Secretary Marco Rubio has coordinated with the Department of Agriculture to resume USAID's food aid program, called Food for Peace.",
      "\"This includes $396 million in agricultural commodities (542,000 metric tons) currently in the supply chain from the U.S. to countries in crisis around the world,\" the State Department spokesperson said.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Tuesday\u00a0fired the USAID inspector general one day after he released the report detailing the potential food spoilage. Paul Martin, the ousted inspector general, was given no reason for his dismissal in a two-sentence email from Trent Morse, deputy director of the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel.",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0targeted USAID\u00a0as President Trump and billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or\u00a0DOGE, seek to cut the size of the federal government. Musk has said the agency should be shut down, calling it \"beyond repair.\"",
      "The future of the agency, established in 1961 to combat poverty, strengthen democracy and protect human rights and global health, is now uncertain. On Friday, a federal judge prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 USAID employees on\u00a0administrative leave,",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",

      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",

Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:02:01 -0500",
    "summary": "Brands paid millions to air their commercials during Super Bowl 2025. Here's what's behind the cost, and why advertisers say it's worth it.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0weren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast were also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers shelled out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimated that around 51 minutes of advertising had been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "Ad prices up, ticket prices down",
      "Contrary to rising ad prices, tickets to see the big game in person were slightly cheaper this year, a drop that\u00a0 StubHub spokesperson Adam Budelli partly attributes to the seating capacity Caesars Superdome's which at\u00a0roughly\u00a073,000 is larger than the 65,000 capacity at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Super Bowl took place last year.",
      "\"What we've seen so far is our average ticket price sold is right around $7,100, and that's actually down around 17% YoY, when compared to the same time in Las Vegas,\" Budelli, told CBS MoneyWatch the Thursday before Super Bowl Sunday.",
      "Another contributing factor impacting ticket sales is travel. \"When you think about a ticket cost or price for an away Super Bowl, how much am I also spending for hotel, airfare, things like that, needs to come into play,\" he said.",
      "Budelli points to fatigue in the market as the third influencing factor, particularly from Chiefs fans. \"I mean this is their fifth out of sixth Super Bowl, so there's only so much money you're willing to spend once you've seen your team and even if you add in the Eagles, in the past 10 years they've also won a Super Bowl.\"",
      "That said, Budelli anticipated higher ticket prices closer to Sunday, something he said is common when it\u00a0 \"marquee, bucket list type of events\" like the Super Bowl. \"Look, there's less than 5,000 tickets available on StubHub; I can assure you there's a lot more buyers out there. At some point \u2014 and it's always hard to exactly predict when \u2014 as those buyers come on, prices increase.",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",
      "Super Bowl ads go back to the first Super Bowl in 1967. Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022. Featuring real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and comedian Colin Jost from \"SNL,\" the 90-second spot is reported to have cost $26 million to produce, according to experience management site Qualtrics.",
      "What is the cheapest Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The cheapest Super Bowl ad ever made appears to be a commercial by a startup company called LifeMinders.com that aired in 2000. The 30-second ad was made by three internal freelancers with a budget of less than $5,000, according to video marketing platform Wistia.",
      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleges that Starbucks is unlawfully relying on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",

Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",

      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's firing of a member at the National Labor Relations Board leaves the federal agency unable to perform its duties protecting the rights of U.S. workers and monitoring union elections, according to labor experts.",
      "The agency is now down to two members, one below the minimum required to fully function, labor attorneys said, even as one of the country's largest companies, Amazon, presses the NLRB to void the results of a recent union election due to the board's downsizing.",
      "\"Right now the NLRB is not operational because there are only two out of five board members and the Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot operate with less than three members,\" Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. and a former field attorney for the NLRB, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",
      "The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wilcox's firing seems \"an illegal termination,\" with no notice or hearing, Cornell's Creighton said, noting that federal law prohibits a president from getting rid of board members except in case of negligence or malfeasance.",
      "How it affects workers",
      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",
      "\"Google once again impressed our panel with a spot that showcased both the functionality of its phone and added its own emotional twist,\" Rucker said.",

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

    "story": [
      "It was only a year ago that Sports Illustrated appeared to be down to the last strike in the bottom of the ninth. Our \"60 Minutes\" colleague Jon Wertheim, a senior writer at the magazine, picks up the story from there:",
      "The great comeback makes for one of the oldest sports tropes. It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made. The scoreboard makes for a grim canvas. Time is winding down. All looks lost. But one team refuses to concede.",
      "Cue the Randy Newman soundtrack! Belief starts to form! A few bounces go the right way! A few heroes meet the moment!",
      "Anyone and everyone in sports media has covered the comeback. But at Sports Illustrated, we got to live it.",
      "It's January 2024, and a new operator decides to try and gut this 70-year-old institution. He announces plans to fire us all. Pretty bleak. Morale hits a low-water mark. There are assorted obituaries. Some staffers would even leave their pride on the sidelines and go on television pleading for a miracle.",
      "And then, there's a financial curveball for a strike (too complicated to spell out here), but the good guys prevail. The ballclub comes together, putting the collective over the individual. A few breaks (and a few news breaks) go our way. And suddenly, Sports Illustrated is back from the brink.",
      "We're publishing print issues in 2025. We will be expanding video production, and launching podcasts, and staging events, and sponsoring stadiums.",
      "If the comeback is a pillar of sports coverage, here's another: Don't be the story. You're there to chronicle the news, not BE the news. But in this case, the comeback of Sports Illustrated might be a story worth telling, a rare blast of good news in today's media landscape.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration, in a letter Thursday, directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure \u2014 funds that had been allocated under former President Joe Biden. President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",
      "The NEVI program awards states $5 billion over five years, but they've struggled with permitting delays, complicated electrical upgrades and contracting.",
      "Estimates suggest $3.3 billion of NEVI funding had already gone out the door to states.",
      "Uncertainty for charging stations along highways",
      "This announcement creates uncertainty, said Ryan Gallentine, managing director at business association Advanced Energy United.",
      "\"Most of the unawarded money is sitting in state Department of Transportation bank accounts ready to be spent,\" Gallentine said in a statement. States are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement, he said. \"We call on state DOTs and program administrators to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.\"",
      "Others say the effort is sure to trigger legal battles.",
      "The administration has \"no legal basis\" for stopping plans that have already been approved and funded, said Andrew Wishnia, former deputy assistant secretary for climate policy at the DOT who helped author the NEVI program.",
      "Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, a company that tracks EV charging data, predicted EV range concerns will linger for drivers. \"If you don't have convenient access either where you live or where you work or in between, why would you get an EV? It just doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "Money that was leftover after states met their highway obligations was meant to fill other gaps in charging: areas where there are low rates of EVs, including low-income areas or areas with a lot of apartment buildings where it hard for people to charge.",
      "The road ahead for U.S. highway EV charging",
      "The federal buildout is not the only effort to build EV charging across the nation. Private companies have collectively spent billions on this infrastructure.",
      "EV industry executives say that the demand from drivers for EV chargers will propel companies to build more of them. \"I think the trend will continue. Maybe it'll slow down over the next four years \u2026 but it's going to continue,\" said Bassem Ammouri, the chief operating officer at EV Connect, a major EV charging platform.",
      "But some fear that delaying critical charging infrastructure could have a domino effect on the EV transition, because it could slow sales, said Matt Stephens-Rich, director of programs at the non-partisan group Electrification Coalition.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",
      "Biden moved to halt the acquisition after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it, saying that maintaining a strong domestic steel industry was important for U.S. national security.",

      "Bondi highlighted some of the allegations in the federal complaint, including that state officials in New York are directed by law to inform undocumented immigrants when federal agents seek information related to their immigration status. The attorney general also alleged during the news conference that New York's statutes unlawfully prevent state and federal law enforcement from enforcing immigration law.",
      "In a separate statement responding to the lawsuit late Wednesday night, Hochul called Bondi's news conference \"smoke and mirrors,\" because the Justice Department's lawsuit was \"a routine civil action about a law passed in 2019 that has been upheld by the courts time and again.\"",
      "\"There's no way I'm letting federal agents, or Elon Musk's shadowy DOGE operation, get unfettered access to the personal data of any New Yorker in the DMV system like 16-year-old kids learning to drive and other vulnerable people,\" Hochul said in a statement.",

He also ruled he did not have the jurisdiction to stop the program from proceeding.",
      "The judge initially paused the original Feb. 6 deadline for workers to accept the offer last week, and held a hearing on Monday over whether he should issue a temporary restraining order extending the pause.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, notified the more than 2 million federal employees last month that they had the option to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would also be exempt from in-person work requirements through September and would not be required to work at their government jobs during the deferred resignation period, according to the notice.",
      "The message from OPM, bearing the subject line \"Fork in the Road,\" notified workers who did not accept the offer that the Trump administration could not give them \"full assurance\" about their continuing employment. OPM also noted that many federal agencies would be downsized \"through restructurings, realignments and reductions in force.\"",
      "Unions representing federal workers sued the federal government last week to stop the deadline and challenge the legality of the program, arguing it violates federal law. But in his ruling on Wednesday, O'Toole wrote the unions' alleged damages were not \"sufficient.\"",
      "He found that the plaintiffs were \"not directly impacted by the directive.\"",
      "\"They allege that the directive subjects them to upstream effects including a diversion of resources to answer members' questions about the directive, a potential loss of membership, and possible reputational harm,\" the judge wrote. \"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others.\"",
      "O'Toole also wrote that aggrieved employees who might take issue with the deferred resignation program and its deadline are statutorily required to first challenge the program via an administrative \u2014 as opposed to judicial \u2013 review process.",
      "\"That the unions themselves may be foreclosed from this administrative process does not mean that adequate judicial review is lacking,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Pinover, the OPM spokesperson, said, \"There is no longer any doubt: the Deferred Resignation Program was both legal and a valuable option for federal employees. This program was carefully designed, thoroughly vetted, and provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures.\"",
      "Democracy Forward's Skye Perrymann said in a statement on behalf of the unions, \"We will continue to pursue all legal options to defend the civil service and protect the American people from extremism.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 20:12:50 -0500",
    "summary": "A group of eight former internal government watchdogs who were fired by President Trump filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging their terminations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of eight former internal government watchdogs who were fired by President Trump filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging their terminations.",
      "The legal challenge, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C, argues that their firings violate federal laws meant to protect inspectors general from interference with their oversight duties. One of those laws, passed in 2022 with bipartisan support in both chambers, requires a president to give Congress 30 days notice before removing an inspector general and provide the \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons\" for the termination.",
      "The former inspectors general involved in the lawsuit worked at the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Education, Agriculture and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration. The lawsuit names the president and the heads of those departments and agencies as defendants.",
      "Inspectors general are nonpartisan and are tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the agencies they oversee to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. They have typically been appointed regardless of political affiliation and must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"President Trump's attempt to eliminate a crucial and longstanding source of impartial, non-partisan oversight of his administration is contrary to the rule of law,\" they said in the 32-page lawsuit, which called the firings \"unlawful and unjustified.\"",
      "The watchdogs said that the agencies revoked access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and collected their equipment, such as government-issued phones and computers and access badges. The officials said they were also \"physically disabled\" from entering the government buildings where they work. Agency employees also arranged for the inspectors general to collect their personal belongings from their offices, the lawsuit states.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because the purported removals were illegal and hence a nullity, the actions just described constituted illegal interference with the IGs' official duties.\"",
      "The watchdogs are asking the court to declare that their removals are void, which would mean that they are still duly appointed inspectors general of their respective agencies until the president removes them in compliance with federal law.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Michael Missal, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs since 2016.",
      "\"My only guess could be they're trying to impact the independence that IGs have, because it makes no sense,\" Missal told CBS News Wednesday of his firing.",
      "Missal argues the firing threatens not only his paycheck, but the safety of veterans in hospitals and clinics nationwide.",
      "\"The work that we did protected veterans' lives and made the healthcare much safer for veterans,\" Missal said.",
      "Missal recently uncovered delays in medical appointments for veterans, including cancer patients in Buffalo. Other inspectors general flagged meat inspections that bypassed safety rules in California, and postal workers stealing credit cards from the mail, including near St. Louis.",
      "Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California argued the fired inspectors general failed to perform.",
      "\"Again, a new administration is acting quicker than any other administration in modern history,\" Issa told CBS News. \"But no, they need to be judged on who's the acting, who's replacing them, how fast they'll name those names, and will they be naming people who will aggressively look for waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Mr. Trump fired the internal government watchdogs on Jan. 24, four days into his second term. They were notified in a two-line email from the Office of Presidential Personnel stating that \"due to changing priorities your position as inspector general ... is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "The president told reporters late last month that the firings were \"standard\" and a \"very common thing to do.\"",
      "But the inspectors general argued in their lawsuit that Mr. Trump's claims are wrong, as presidents of both parties \u2014 including the president during his first term \u2014 refrained from removing the internal watchdogs that were in place by their predecessors.",
      "They also said that Mr. Trump has not communicated to Congress his intention to remove the inspectors general or provided a \"substantive rationale,\" as required by law.",
      "\"IGs must be watchdogs, not lapdogs,\" the lawsuit states. \"The deleterious consequences of the Trump administration's contrary approach are hard to overstate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to terminate the officials set off alarm bells in Congress. In the wake of his action, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and ranking member Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, sent the president a letter asking him to provide the legally required 30-day notice and reasons for their removal.",
      "Grassley sponsored the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which laid out the requirements for getting rid of an inspector general.",
      "\"While IGs aren't immune from committing acts requiring their removal and they can be removed by the president, the law must be followed,\" Grassley and Durbin wrote.",
      "They added: \"This is a matter of public and congressional accountability and ensuring the public's confidence in the Inspector General community, a sentiment shared more broadly by other members of Congress. IGs are critical to rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the Executive Branch bureaucracy, which you have publicly made clear you are also intent on doing.\"",
      "The lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's removal of the watchdogs is one of more than four dozen that have been filed in courts from coast to coast against the administration. Several of those legal battles target the president's firing of government officials, including the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Office of Special Counsel, which investigates retaliation against whistleblowers and violations of the Hatch Act, as well as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.",

It came a day after Russia released\u00a0Pennsylvania schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was considered by the U.S. to be wrongfully detained.",
      "\"I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" the president wrote on Truth Social\u00a0Wednesday morning. \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the \"great benefit that we will someday have in working together\" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine. In addition to the pledge to begin discussions on the war, the president and his Russian counterpart said they would visit \"each other's nation.\"",
      "The president said he has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to lead negotiations on the war.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted roughly an hour, and said the two leaders would likely meet in Saudi Arabia for their first sitdown of his new term. He told reporters that Putin \"wants peace\" and \"wants to see it end.\" Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon after his call with the Russian leader. Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X that \"[n]o one wants peace more than Ukraine\" and that Ukraine is \"charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.\" Mr. Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social that the conversation with Zelenskyy went \"very well\" and said it's \"time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's conversation with Putin came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed to undercut\u00a0key Ukrainian positions in eventual peace talks, including by ruling out eventual membership in NATO. Speaking ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contract Group about more aid, Hegseth said peace in the country must include security guarantees that \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief also said Ukraine's goal of returning to its borders before 2014, when Russia first invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, was an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The president, too, has addressed the prospect of Russia maintaining control of Ukrainian territory its forces have occupied, suggesting in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday that Ukraine \"may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also said he is \"OK\" with taking the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO off the table. \"I don't think it's practical,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump frequently claims that Russia would not have launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago if he were president and vowed on the campaign trail to quickly bring an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet\u00a0with Ukraine's Zelenskyy at a security conference in Munich that begins Friday.",
      "The president has been a vehement critic of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, prompting concerns from Kyiv that assistance would stop flowing with him back in office. He told Fox News that aid could depend on Ukraine agreeing a trade deal that gives the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",

    "story": [
      "A top-ranking scientist at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Lawrence Tabak, was forced to retire this week, multiple people familiar with the move say, marking the highest-profile departure of a health official under the Trump administration so far this year.",
      "Tabak's retirement, which he told colleagues was effective Tuesday, ends a decades-long tenure serving at the federal medical research agency, including multiple years as the acting director of the NIH during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also served as the agency's top ethics official.",
      "An email circulated among NIH staff from Tabak did not explain why he was abruptly stepping down, which multiple people familiar with the decision said came earlier than he was planning. One person said he did not plan to retire until at least the fall.",
      "Tabak told one federal researcher that he said he \"found it necessary to retire today from federal service.\" A former colleague said Tabak, who should have been the second-in-command at the agency, had been excluded from key meetings.",
      "Tabak and spokespeople for the National Institutes of Health did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "\"He has helped shape important policy decisions at NIH over four administrations. He has guided NIH through complex issues and will be sorely missed,\" acting NIH Director Dr. Matthew Memoli said in an email Wednesday afternoon to NIH staff announcing the retirement.",
      "The departure follows years of intense scrutiny of Tabak from Republican lawmakers at multiple congressional hearings, when he faced questioning over issues like the agency's oversight of \"gain-of-function\" research on viruses, which can make them more dangerous and is supposed to be tightly controlled, as well as grants to the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services found in a review of grants dating back to 2014 that the NIH missed opportunities to avoid paying for $89,171 in costs to the groups that should not have been allowed, like vague employee bonuses. It also faulted the NIH for not doing more to ensure its funds did not go towards gain-of-function research.",
      "Tabak's retirement also comes amid ongoing court battles over a decision last week to make steep cuts to the amount of money for facilities and administration costs that the federal government has agreed to pay for in medical research.",
      "A federal judge has for now temporarily blocked those cuts nationwide, pending further arguments in lawsuits brought by medical colleges, universities and state attorneys general.",
      "Several scientists have come out to praise Tabak, who was often tasked as the agency's principal deputy director to handle difficult problems at the NIH.",
      "\"Larry was brilliant at deflecting credit away from himself in order to raise up colleagues, mentees, and those who might otherwise have lacked a voice,\" posted Carrie Wolinetz, a former senior adviser to the NIH director.",
      "In addition to his administrative duties, Tabak also continued to lead a team within the NIH publishing biochemistry research.",
      "Jordan Lara, a research fellow in Tabak's lab at the NIH, praised him for having \"always made time\" for mentorship and scientific research.",
      "\"He would work 80 hours a week regularly with no days off. He truly gave himself up for the American public. it's absolutely insane to have him cast out like this and to paint him as anything other than a dedicated public servant,\" said Lara in a message.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Collectors said the value of certain pennies could rise if the U.S. Treasury stopped manufacturing the coin.",
    "story": [
      "Can a penny saved finally be truly worth it? Collectors are asking that question this week after President Trump ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to stop minting the penny.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in Truth Social post on Sunday. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"",
      "Every penny costs 3.7 cents to manufacture and the U.S. Treasury lost $85.3 million in 2024 producing them, the U.S. Mint reported. Congress sets currency specifications, so it's unclear whether Mr. Trump has the power to eliminate the penny, but the president might be able to stop the Treasury from minting them.",
      "This is key, collectors say, to possibly driving up the price of 2025 pennies and rare pennies currently in circulation.",
      "\"As an avid collector of coins, the coin collecting community is excited as the discontinuation of the penny is a historic event and it brings a renewed interest in rare and valuable editions,\" avid coin collector Scott Evans told CBS News.",
      "He pointed to the rise in interest in Canada's penny after the country discontinued producing the coin in 2012 as a guide for collectors. The Royal Canadian Mint removed at least 6 billion pennies in the first three years after stopping production, depositing them at financial institutions and trucking them from coast to coast to recover their valuable copper and zinc, Canada's government said in a report analyzing its penny removal.",
      "Over 3.5 billion Canadian pennies were returned in the first year alone, and fewer pennies meant more value for the ones left behind. Some valuable pennies include coins from the 1920s \u2014 as most pennies from this decade are hard to find, the Canadian Mint said\u00a0\u2014 and from 1936, when only a few \"dot\" cents are known to exist, making them extremely rare.",
      "This is what bullish collectors hope to see if production stops in the U.S. Evans referenced coins with errors on them or coins with significant dates that might see a big increase in value. Before 1982, pennies were made of 95% copper and 5% zinc, and those made of precious metals might see an increase. He pointed to pennies such as the 1943 Copper Penny or the 1982-D Small Date Copper Penny that might jump in price.",
      "Rare coin and precious metal collector Jonathan Aminov told CBS News he doesn't predict a huge jump in price for the penny.",
      "\"I get calls about pennies all day long,\" said Aminov, who owns Big Apple Coins in Manhattan.",
      "He said the U.S. won't see a foreseeable shortage of pennies anytime because there are too many coins in circulation.",
      "Aminov said collectors might see interest in the 2025 penny because that was the year the coin stopped being minted. If 500 million pennies were ordered for the year and 50 million were minted, then those coins are going to be more desirable, he said.",
      "He also cautioned that it would be difficult to obtain big prices for pennies as the coin would have to be extremely rare saying, \"Pennies are a bit of a longshot.\"",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

      "The Kennedy Center's board voted unanimously to elect President Trump to be its new chair Wednesday afternoon, as the president reshapes the center's governing body and performances, moving away from what he views as \"woke culture,\" multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "One board member, Jacqueline Mars was present, but did not vote, one source said. After Mr. Trump announced plans last week to remove the Kennedy Center's chairman and board of trustees and install himself as chairman, the White House has begun filling board member slots that are open, sources say.",

      "The board also removed David Rubenstein, philanthropist and co-founder of the Carlyle Group. He had been the chairman of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees for 14 years and had announced that he would step down in September 2026. But the White House ousted him first.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:01:14 -0500",
    "summary": "While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals and suspected gang members to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrant detainees who lack serious criminal records or any at all, according to two U.S. officials and internal government documents.",
      "When he ordered officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into a large-scale immigration detention site late last month, President Trump said it would house the \"worst\" migrants and \"provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "Administration officials have since touted military flights to Guantanamo that they said have transported migrants in the U.S. illegally who have also committed violent crimes like murder and rape, as well as alleged members of Tren de Aragua, the infamous gang that originated in Venezuelan prisons.",
      "Internal documents and interviews with U.S. officials indicate the administration has sent migrant criminals and alleged gang members to Guantanamo, detaining them in the post-9/11 maximum-security prison that also houses, in a separate section, more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "But in addition to sending those with criminal records or suspected or known gang ties \u2014 classified as \"high-risk\" detainees \u2014 U.S. officials have also transported migrants deemed to be \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, according to the government documents obtained by CBS News. More low-risk migrants are expected to be transported on Wednesday, alongside high-risk detainees, the documents show.",
      "Federal immigration authorities define low-risk detainees as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been arrested or convicted of violent offenses or other serious crimes, government guidelines show. U.S. officials said they could include migrants who lack any criminal record but have been ordered deported because of civil immigration violations, like entering the country without proper documents.",
      "While the high-risk migrants have been detained in cells at Guantanamo's maximum-security prison, the low-risk detainees have been placed in a barrack-like facility known as the Migrant Operations Center that includes rooms with restrooms, according to the documents and one of the U.S. officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "The State Department has traditionally used the Migrant Operations Center to house asylum-seekers intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard, while they wait to be resettled in third countries.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed CBS News' reporting, including the separate housing arrangements.",
      "\"In addition to holding violent gang members and other high-threat illegal aliens, Guantanamo Bay is also holding other illegal aliens with final deportation orders. Every single alien at Guantanamo Bay has a final deportation order,\" the spokesperson said. \"All of these individuals committed a crime by entering the United States illegally.\"",
      "In two weeks, officials have made some progress in operationalizing Mr. Trump's instructions to establish the facilities needed to detain as many as 30,000 unauthorized migrants at the base in Guantanamo, a 45-square mile stretch of Cuban land that the U.S. has leased for over a century.",
      "Over the past week, U.S. service members at the base have been erecting tents to house migrant detainees beyond the prison and Migrant Operations Center, both of which have limited capacities.",
      "Officials have also been meeting the administration's goal of transporting groups of detainees to the base daily, sending eight military flights over the last nine days. The flights, however, have only carried up to 15 detainees each, due to limits on how many can be transported at one time when they reach the base.",
      "As of late Tuesday, nearly 100 unauthorized migrants were being held at Guantanamo, all of them adults from Venezuela, one of the U.S. officials said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said recently the detainees will be held there until they can be deported, but it's unclear when that could happen.",
      "In recent years, Venezuela's repressive government has generally rejected American deportation flights, citing the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. Under a recently brokered agreement with the Trump administration, Venezuela sent two planes to the Texas border earlier this week to pick nearly 200 of its citizens who were in U.S. immigration custody and transport them back to Venezuela. But similar flights to Guantanamo have not been announced.",
      "While some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration for using Guantanamo to hold migrant detainees, the effort has alarmed pro-immigrant civil rights groups. They have accused the administration of using the naval base as a \"legal black hole\" to hold migrants \"incommunicado,\" demanding that the detainees be given access to lawyers.",
      "While the transportation of low-risk migrants to Guantanamo undermines statements from Trump officials that the facility would be used to house \"the worst of the worst,\" it also reinforces a message the administration has communicated repeatedly: no one who is in the U.S. illegally will be shielded from detention and deportation, even if they lack criminal histories.",

      "Washington \u2014 A group of advocates led by the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday asking a federal court to quickly require the Trump administration to give the migrant detainees it is holding at Guantanamo Bay access to lawyers.",
      "Complying with an order from President Trump late last month, U.S. officials have been transporting dozens of unauthorized migrants to the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, using military aircraft. Administration officials have said the detainees will be held there until they can be deported.",
      "In its 29-page lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the ACLU said those detained at Guantanamo have a right under the Constitution and federal immigration law to see legal counsel, and accused the Trump administration of holding them \"incommunicado.\" The group demanded that lawyers be given immediate access to the migrant detainees there, virtually and in-person.",
      "\"Sending immigrants to a remote island without access to attorneys is shocking, and if permitted by the courts, would set a dangerous precedent,\" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who filed the lawsuit, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "The request for a temporary restraining order was filed on behalf of several relatives of migrants believed to be detained at Guantanamo, as well as four legal services providers in Texas and Florida that want to offer them representation.",
      "\"The government has announced its goal of sending tens of thousands of immigrants to Guant\u00e1namo in the near future,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Without this Court's intervention, even more immigrants will be transferred to this legal black box without access to counsel or any means of vindicating their rights.\"",
      "Asked for comment on the ACLU's lawsuit, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said there's \"a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers\" at Guantanamo Bay.",

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press pushed back against the Trump administration on Tuesday after one of its reporters was blocked from an event over the news organization's guidance on its continued use of the \"Gulf of Mexico\" in its coverage, calling the move a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The White House demanded early Tuesday that the AP alter its style guidance to use the name Gulf of America versus using the Gulf of Mexico, AP\u00a0executive editor Julie Pace\u00a0said in a statement. President Trump renamed the body of water to the Gulf of America through an executive order last month. Later on Tuesday, Pace said the White House stopped an AP reporter from attending Mr. Trump's executive order signing in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism. Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP's speech not only severely impedes the public's access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment,\" Pace said.",
      "When asked Wednesday which White House official made the decision to bar the AP reporter, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"It's a privilege to cover this White House.\"",
      "\"Nobody has the right to go into the Oval Office and ask the president of the United States questions. That's an invitation that is given and there are hundreds of outlets on this campus, many of you in this room, who don't have the privilege of being part of that pool every single day and getting to ask the president questions,\" she said.",
      "Oftentimes when covering the White House, there are pool reporters who are selected to cover an event on behalf of a larger group of media outlets. It's not unusual that a select group of reporters is allowed inside the Oval Office.",
      "What's atypical is barring a reporter over language that the administration wants the news outlet to use.",
      "\"Punishing journalists for not adopting state-mandated terminology is an alarming attack on press freedom,\" the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit which advocates for First Amendment protections, said in response to the White House's action. \"That's viewpoint discrimination, and it's unconstitutional. President Trump has the authority to change how the U.S. government refers to the Gulf. But he cannot punish a news organization for using another term.\"",
      "Leavitt on Wednesday said, \"It is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America and I'm not sure why news outlets don't want to call it that, but that is what it is.\" She added, \"It's very important to this administration that we get that right, not just for people here at home, but also for the rest of the world.\"",
      "The AP's style guide, which many newsrooms across the country follow, published an update on Jan. 23, two days after the president signed his executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico, noting that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the United States and other countries do not have to recognize the change.",
      "\"As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,\" the guidance reads.",
      "In his executive order, Mr. Trump also reverted the name of North America's tallest peak in Alaska, Denali, back to Mount McKinley. The AP's guidance says that it will be referring to it as Mount McKinley.",

      "A Russian cybercriminal and crypto fraudster will be sent back to Moscow as part of a prisoner swap that on Tuesday brought American Marc Fogel home after more than three years in Russian custody.",
      "Alexander Vinnik in 2024 entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The 45-year-old operated BTC-e, at one point one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Prosecutors said BTC-e was a valuable tool for criminals looking to move or launder money. They said BTC-e pocketed $121 million from \"numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Vinnik would be exchanged for Fogel and would be returning to Russia.",
      "\"Vinnik was a nonviolent crypto criminal, and as part of this exchange, he has forfeited more than $100 million that he obtained in that illegal crime,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017, the first year of President Trump's first administration. British cryptocurrency analysis firm Elliptic claimed in a 2020 report that BTC-e may have been used to finance cyber attacks in 2015 and 2016 targeting the Democratic National Committee.",
      "The practice of using cryptocurrency to fund Russian cyber attacks was described in a report by special counsel Robert Mueller III, who investigated the country's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Mueller's investigation did not find the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government.",
      "Vinnik's name has since been included in a series of negotiations that led to prisoner exchanges between the U.S. and Russia.",
      "He was due to be sentenced in June 2025.",
      "Alameda County Santa Rita jail, the California detention center where Vinnik was being held, told CBS News that he had been released from custody there on Feb. 10.",
      "Vinnik's lawyers told CBS News in a statement that a recent hearing had taken place in federal court, but that they were unable to share more details.",
      "\"We can only note that professional legal defense, high-quality political analysis, and appropriate lobbying mechanisms can sometimes have a significant impact on the course of events,\" Vinnik's lawyer said. \"The sentencing in this case has been postponed multiple times, largely due to the political landscape, where certain administrative changes may play in favor of our client.\"",
      "Vinnik's lawyer earlier confirmed he was still in the U.S.",
      "His lawyers claimed in a 2023 court filing that the U.S. at one point offered to trade Vinnik in exchange for basketball star Brittney Griner, \"but the exchange took a different turn.\"",
      "Ultimately, the deal came for an American who had similarly watched as others from his country were sent home in deal after deal. Marc Fogel, a schoolteacher who had been held in Russia since 2021, stepped on U.S. soil late Tuesday night.",
      "The 63-year-old\u00a0whose family had tirelessly advocated for his release was brought to the White House, where he met Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other leaders.",

He said he would be calling Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately \"to inform him of the conversation.\"",
      "In remarks delivered ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to discuss further aid for Ukraine, Hegseth called Ukraine's goal of returning to its pre-2014 borders \u2014 before Russian forces first invaded and started seizing ground, annexing the Crimean Peninsula \u2014 an \"unrealistic objective.\"",

      "Around 50 countries make up the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which has provided support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.",
      "Hegseth said that, moving forward, Europe should \"provide the overwhelming share of lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine,\" and urged those in attendance at the Brussels summit to speak to their governments about increasing their defense spending, as the U.S. shifts its focus elsewhere.",

      "Mr. Trump promised that he would quickly end the war in Ukraine when he took office earlier this year, and he's often complained about it being too costly to U.S. taxpayers.",

    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules.

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

    "summary": "\"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,\" Marc Fogel said, standing alongside President Trump in the White House upon his return.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Marc Fogel, an American schoolteacher who had been held in Russia since 2021, arrived back on U.S. soil late Tuesday night after the White House announced earlier in the day it had negotiated his release.",
      "The White House released a photo of a jubilant Fogel disembarking a plane at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Alongside him were White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's envoy for hostages.",
      "He was then taken to the White House, where he was greeted outside on the North Portico by President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, among others.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that a Russian citizen who was behind bars in the U.S. had been freed as part of the swap that included Fogel's release. Peskov said the Russian's identity would be disclosed once he or she was back in Russia.",
      "In a briefing with reporters alongside Mr. Trump in the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House, Fogel said, \"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now.\" He called the president \"a hero\" for facilitating his return.",
      "\"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world,\" Fogel said.",
      "Mr. Trump would not say how the U.S. and Russia reached the deal securing Fogel's freedom, only describing the terms as \"very fair, very reasonable.\" The president also teased that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of.\"",
      "Mr. Trump declined to say if he spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of Fogel's release, but late Wednesday morning, he\u00a0posted on social media that he had just had \"a lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with the Russian leader. He said the two \"discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\" And he said he thanked Putin for releasing Fogel.",
      "The president said in his post that the two agreed to \"work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations\" and would begin negotiations \"immediately\" to end the war in Ukraine, and he added that he would be calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to inform him of his conversation with Putin. He said he has asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Ambassador and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff to lead the negotiations.",
      "Witkoff offered some detail to reporters Wednesday morning. He said the deal had come together in the last few days and included the involvement of Ratcliffe, Waltz, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Witkoff said Mr. Trump \"has a very strong relationship\" with bin Salman. The Saudi leader \"was encouraging and pushing and looking for the right result,\" Witkoff said. \"And it was helpful. It really was.\"",
      "When he departed for Russia, Witkoff said he wasn't certain whether Fogel would be released \u2014 Mr. Trump had told him, \"Let's get over there and see if we can finish it.\"",
      "He recounted receiving a call saying Fogel would be at the airport \u2014 Witkoff declined to identify the caller \u2014 and he subsequently called Mr. Trump, who urged him to \"get over there fast.\" He said he spent six or seven hours on the ground in Russia but declined to say whether he met or spoke with Putin.",
      "\"President Putin had to pardon [Fogel] and had to approve it, so, that that evidently happened,\" Witkoff said. Upon seeing Fogel, he told him, \"You're close to U.S. territory now.\" Once Witkoff's plane was de-iced, they departed. Upon leaving Russian airspace, they called Fogel's family. Fogel \"was doing a jig,\" Witkoff said. When they landed at Joint Base Andrews, \"I think he began singing,\" he added.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump greeted Fogel and gave him and Witkoff a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom.",
      "Fogel was serving a 14-year sentence in Russia and was\u00a0designated as \"wrongfully detained\"\u00a0by the U.S. late last year.",
      "\"President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,\" he said in a statement. \"Since President Trump's swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States.\"",
      "Boehler had posted an earlier photo of Fogel on the plane back to the U.S.:",

      "Why was Marc Fogel detained?",
      "Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested by Russian authorities at the airport in Moscow in 2021. His family had said he was carrying 17 grams of marijuana for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",
      "In addition to Fogel, that deal omitted several other Americans imprisoned in Russia, including musician\u00a0Michael Travis Leake, U.S. Army staff sergeant\u00a0Gordon Black\u00a0and Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina.",
      "In a statement, Fogel's family thanked Mr. Trump and other allies who fought for his release.",
      "\"We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,\" they said. \"Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs. This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "\"I am thrilled that Marc Fogel is finally coming home after years of being wrongfully held in Russia,\" McCormick, a Republican, said in a post. \"I have been working with the administration on this since day one and I'm grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rubio for delivering on their commitment to free Marc. As I told Marc's Mom, Mafa, when we spoke in August, we had to do everything possible to get Marc home and it is a blessing that this day has finally come.\"",
      "Fogel's mother, Malphine Fogel, had criticized Biden and his administration for the delay in designating her son as wrongfully detained. That determination that is made by the secretary of state and clears the way for State Department offices and federal agencies to work together to develop a plan to secure the release of a detainee.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against the State Department last June, but the case was dismissed. Malphine Fogel was set to draw more public attention to her son's detainment during a July 13 rally with Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, but the campaign event was upended when a gunman opened fire on the crowd. The president and two others were injured, and one man was killed during the assassination attempt.",
      "\"I was going to be on stage with him and he was going to mention [Marc's] name,\" Malphine Fogel told CBS News Pittsburgh last July. \"We were going to put it out for the whole world to hear. Well, that didn't happen because we didn't get on stage.\"",
      "She met with Mr. Trump before the rally and said he pledged to secure Marc Fogel's release if elected to a second term.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday, teeing up a final vote on his confirmation later this week.",
      "In a 53 to 47 vote, the Senate voted to clear the final procedural hurdle to Kennedy's nomination. The vote fell along party lines.",
      "Kennedy's path to confirmation was once considered among the most fragile of President Trump's nominees. The 71-year-old faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike in recent weeks, including during a pair of fiery hearings last month, where he was grilled over his controversial views on vaccines and abortion.",
      "The longtime environmental lawyer and activist launched a White House bid in the 2024 election, though he initially sought the Democratic nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy. He dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August.",
      "Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee last week, with the vote coming down to a single Republican. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over his nomination because Kennedy has raised doubts about vaccines. Then, moments ahead of the committee vote, Cassidy said he would support him.",
      "Outside of the committee, Republican opposition to Kennedy's nomination has also appeared to dissipate. Sen. Susan Collins, who is among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, told reporters Monday she planned to support Kennedy's confirmation. On Wednesday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another Republican often willing to buck her party, announced she would support Kennedy's confirmation as well.",
      "Democrats have strongly opposed the nominee to lead HHS. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued that the support among Republicans comes in response to pressure from the White House.",
      "\"The vote on RFK is about one simple question,\" Schumer said. \"Will Republicans do the right thing for American public health, or will they do whatever is necessary to keep Donald Trump happy, no matter how misguided he is?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Kennedy in advance of the procedural vote, saying he looks forward to Kennedy being a \"partner to Congress on some very important issues,\" including chronic disease. And Thune said he's encouraged that Kennedy has \"committed to implementing President Trump's pro-life policies at HHS.\"",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy promises to make HHS a collaborative, transparent and science-driven agency under his leadership,\" Thune said, adding that Kennedy has committed to an \"unprecedented level of collaboration with Congress\" and \"regular and robust oversight of his agency's activities.\"",

      "The budget proposal says that the House Ways and Means Committee can pursue up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, and sets a goal of cutting mandatory spending by $2 trillion. It would also increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The long-awaited budget resolution comes as congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package under the budget reconciliation process that would enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend some of the 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to trim government programs and address the debt limit.",
      "In the House, the process has faced delays amid intraparty disagreement on how to proceed. And the stalled progress in the lower chamber has prompted the Senate to move ahead with its own proposal in recent days, with a markup taking place Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "The House Budget Committee is also set to begin marking up its newly released budget resolution on Thursday, as House Republicans look to keep pace with the competing Senate proposal.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on X on Wednesday that nearly all House Republicans have been \"directly engaged\" in the process, saying the resolution \"reflects our collective commitment to enacting the President's full agenda\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not just a part of it.\"",
      "\"There will be ongoing debates and discussions in the coming weeks, and we remain focused on working through the process to deliver on our promises made to the American people,\" Johnson said.",

      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, is leading the charge in the upper chamber. He told reporters earlier in the week that while he supports the House's effort to approve a single package, lawmakers can't wait to iron out the complicated tax details.

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Trump's executive order\u00a0and firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio gird for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than they've faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \"we were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\"",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Mr. Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it's filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \"We're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\" Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \"systemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\"",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. Republican Sen. Mike Lee, of Utah, posted \"let's defund PBS and NPR\" on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\"I think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\" Kerger said. \"I never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\"",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \"there is bias at play\" when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \"We take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\" she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\"I'm always an optimistic person,\" Kerger said, \"but I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

      "As acting director, Rowe testified multiple times before lawmakers, addressing questions about the security failures that allowed the gunman in Butler, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to gain access to a rooftop so close to where President Trump was speaking. His most recent appearance before the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt, last December, devolved into a shouting match when Republican Rep. Pat Fallon accused him of \"playing politics\" when he attended a 9/11 memorial event with the nation's top leaders.",

      "Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin said he has \"highly credible information\" that Patel is behind the firings at the bureau, though he is not yet the FBI director. Patel denied any knowledge of them when he testified before the committee.",
      "In a letter to Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Durbin wrote that even though Patel has not yet been confirmed as director, \"multiple sources\" said Patel has been personally directing the purge at the FBI.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin told the Justice Department IG that he had heard from his sources that Patel's directives were being carried out by top White House aide Stephen Miller, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and members of the new FBI Director's Advisory Team. A member of the team, Durbin said his sources told him, has been providing Patel with information about what's going on inside the bureau, and that Patel \"then provides direction to Mr. Miller, who relays it to Acting Deputy Attorney General Bove.\" He claimed that each person on the DAT team communicated to bureau officials that \"at some point before January 30 that they had been in direct contact with Mr. Patel.\"",
      "DAT, Durbin said, had a list that \"identified certain officials and was seen by multiple FBI leaders.\" Those on the list were understood to be \"people in the crosshairs.\" On Jan. 29, Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll and Acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane held a meeting \"where it was relayed that a group of Executive Assistant Directors (EAD) and other supervisors must resign or be fired,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin quoted \"[c]ontemporaneous notes\" from a meeting between Justice Department and FBI leadership earlier that day that said, \"KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.\" Durbin said that Bove told people at the meeting he had \"received multiple calls\" from Miller, who was \"pressuring him\" because \"Mr. Patel wanted the FBI to remove targeted employees faster, as DOJ had already done with prosecutors.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Patel was nominated to replace Christopher Wray, who was himself a Trump appointee during the president's first term. But Mr. Trump soured on Wray during the FBI's investigation of the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Wray resigned on Jan. 20.",
      "Durbin said that if the allegations about Patel's involvement in the FBI firings are true, \"Mr. Patel may have perjured himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Patel said he was \"not aware\" of ongoing plans to punish or fire FBI agents and personnel who had worked on the multiple investigations into Mr.\u00a0 Trump, adding, \"I don't know what's going on right now over there.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:11:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, one expert said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",
      "\"The experience that [the United States has] on civil nuclear energy will give us all of the tools we need to train our people, to train our Salvadoran experts, who will lead the technical and regulatory aspects of this transition \u2014 this unprecedented transition,\" Hill Tonoco said.",
      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",
      "\"This is something that probably will not happen during the Trump administration, and it will take a long time to materialize, if it materializes,\" Monaldi said.",

      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner.

    "summary": "Endangered Mexican long-nosed bats are now being tracked via \"eDNA\" using their saliva.",
    "story": [
      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

    "summary": "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said.",

      "A colossal explosion in the sky, unleashing energy hundreds of times greater than the Hiroshima bomb. A blinding flash nearly as bright as the sun. Shockwaves powerful enough to flatten everything for miles.",
      "It may sound apocalyptic, but a newly detected asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of colliding with Earth in about eight years.",
      "Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes. CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday the Justice Department is filing a lawsuit against the state of New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Attorney General Letitia James over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We are taking steps to protect Americans,\" Bondi said, adding that \"New York has chosen to prioritize illegal aliens over American citizens.\"",
      "\"We sued Illinois, and New York didn't listen, so now, you're next,\" Bondi said.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News New York Wednesday night in response to the lawsuit, James said: \"Our state laws, including the Green Light law, protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe. I am prepared to defend our laws, just as I always have.\"",
      "Bondi highlighted some of the allegations in the federal complaint, including that state officials in New York are directed by law to inform undocumented immigrants when federal agents seek information related to their immigration status. The attorney general also alleged during the news conference that New York's statutes unlawfully prevent state and federal law enforcement from enforcing immigration law.",
      "In a separate statement responding to the lawsuit late Wednesday night, Hochul called Bondi's news conference \"smoke and mirrors,\" because the Justice Department's lawsuit was \"a routine civil action about a law passed in 2019 that has been upheld by the courts time and again.\"",
      "\"There's no way I'm letting federal agents, or Elon Musk's shadowy DOGE operation, get unfettered access to the personal data of any New Yorker in the DMV system like 16-year-old kids learning to drive and other vulnerable people,\" Hochul said in a statement.",
      "\"We expect Pam Bondi's worthless, publicity-driven lawsuit to be a total failure, just like all the others. Let me be clear: New York is not backing down,\" Hochul continued.",
      "Absent from the lawsuit is New York City Mayor Eric Adams. On Tuesday, the Justice Department directed prosecutors to drop their probe into Adams' office for now, arguing that the legal case \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\" that occurred in his city under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"We're hoping that in New York, that Mayor Adams is going to cooperate with us with the sanctuary cities and the illegal aliens,\" Bondi said, adding later that while the case against Adams had not yet been dropped, she expected federal prosecutors to dismiss the charges soon.",
      "Tammy Nobles, the mother of a woman killed by an MS-13 gang member from El Salvador, spoke during the news conference about the murder of her daughter.",
      "In her first hours as attorney general, she issued a sweeping set of directives that targeted sanctuary jurisdictions with an order to end funding to any that \"unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.\" She encouraged the department to pursue enforcement actions against sanctuary cities or states that don't comply with the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\"State and local jurisdictions must comply with applicable immigration-related federal laws,\" one memo read. It also said that \"state and local actors may not impede, obstruct, or otherwise fail to comply with lawful immigration-related directives.\"",
      "In another memo, Bondi targeted cartels and transnational criminal organizations, writing that \"additional resources and thoughtful charging decisions\" would be necessary to fight illegal drug trafficking and the department would pursue \"total elimination\" of these groups.",
      "Last week, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the state of Illinois, the city of Chicago and other local jurisdictions alleging their laws stood in the way of the Trump administration's increased immigration enforcement in the area.",
      "In the first weeks of the Trump administration, Bondi's acting deputy, Emil Bove, instructed Justice Department prosecutors across the country to focus on enacting Mr. Trump's immigration policies in their prosecutions and said they should potentially charge state or local officials who might impede their efforts.",
      "During Thursday's press conference, Bondi also responded to questions about Elon Musk's criticism of judges who have ruled against the Trump administration's moves in recent weeks. The tech billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency has advocated impeaching federal judges over their decisions.",

    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts allowed the Trump administration's bid to offer \"deferred resignations\" to federal workers who voluntarily leave government service to continue and lifted a previous court order pausing the program's deadline.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Office of Personnel Management   spokesperson McLaurine Pinover said in a statement that the office was \"pleased\" with the court's decision and that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "Judge George O'Toole, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case \u2014 unions that represent federal employees \u2014 lacked standing to bring the case in the first place. He also ruled he did not have the jurisdiction to stop the program from proceeding.",
      "The judge initially paused the original Feb. 6 deadline for workers to accept the offer last week, and held a hearing on Monday over whether he should issue a temporary restraining order extending the pause.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, notified the more than 2 million federal employees last month that they had the option to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would also be exempt from in-person work requirements through September and would not be required to work at their government jobs during the deferred resignation period, according to the notice.",
      "The message from OPM, bearing the subject line \"Fork in the Road,\" notified workers who did not accept the offer that the Trump administration could not give them \"full assurance\" about their continuing employment. OPM also noted that many federal agencies would be downsized \"through restructurings, realignments and reductions in force.\"",
      "Unions representing federal workers sued the federal government last week to stop the deadline and challenge the legality of the program, arguing it violates federal law. But in his ruling on Wednesday, O'Toole wrote the unions' alleged damages were not \"sufficient.\"",
      "He found that the plaintiffs were \"not directly impacted by the directive.\"",
      "\"They allege that the directive subjects them to upstream effects including a diversion of resources to answer members' questions about the directive, a potential loss of membership, and possible reputational harm,\" the judge wrote. \"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others.\"",
      "O'Toole also wrote that aggrieved employees who might take issue with the deferred resignation program and its deadline are statutorily required to first challenge the program via an administrative \u2014 as opposed to judicial \u2013 review process.",
      "\"That the unions themselves may be foreclosed from this administrative process does not mean that adequate judicial review is lacking,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Pinover, the OPM spokesperson, said, \"There is no longer any doubt: the Deferred Resignation Program was both legal and a valuable option for federal employees. This program was carefully designed, thoroughly vetted, and provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures.\"",
      "Democracy Forward's Skye Perrymann said in a statement on behalf of the unions, \"We will continue to pursue all legal options to defend the civil service and protect the American people from extremism.\"",
      "The deferred resignation offer is part of a broader initiative undertaken by President Trump to slash the size of the federal government. The president issued several directives soon after the start of his second term last month that were aimed at reducing the federal workforce, including mandating employees return to their offices five days a week and reinstating an order that created a new category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of certain employment protections.",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",

    "summary": "Dr. Lawrence Tabak was the health research agency's second-in-command.",
    "story": [
      "A top-ranking scientist at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Lawrence Tabak, was forced to retire this week, multiple people familiar with the move say, marking the highest-profile departure of a health official under the Trump administration so far this year.",
      "Tabak's retirement, which he told colleagues was effective Tuesday, ends a decades-long tenure serving at the federal medical research agency, including multiple years as the acting director of the NIH during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also served as the agency's top ethics official.",
      "An email circulated among NIH staff from Tabak did not explain why he was abruptly stepping down, which multiple people familiar with the decision said came earlier than he was planning. One person said he did not plan to retire until at least the fall.",
      "Tabak told one federal researcher that he said he \"found it necessary to retire today from federal service.\" A former colleague said Tabak, who should have been the second-in-command at the agency, had been excluded from key meetings.",
      "Tabak and spokespeople for the National Institutes of Health did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "\"He has helped shape important policy decisions at NIH over four administrations. He has guided NIH through complex issues and will be sorely missed,\" acting NIH Director Dr. Matthew Memoli said in an email Wednesday afternoon to NIH staff announcing the retirement.",
      "The departure follows years of intense scrutiny of Tabak from Republican lawmakers at multiple congressional hearings, when he faced questioning over issues like the agency's oversight of \"gain-of-function\" research on viruses, which can make them more dangerous and is supposed to be tightly controlled, as well as grants to the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services found in a review of grants dating back to 2014 that the NIH missed opportunities to avoid paying for $89,171 in costs to the groups that should not have been allowed, like vague employee bonuses. It also faulted the NIH for not doing more to ensure its funds did not go towards gain-of-function research.",
      "Tabak's retirement also comes amid ongoing court battles over a decision last week to make steep cuts to the amount of money for facilities and administration costs that the federal government has agreed to pay for in medical research.",
      "A federal judge has for now temporarily blocked those cuts nationwide, pending further arguments in lawsuits brought by medical colleges, universities and state attorneys general.",
      "Several scientists have come out to praise Tabak, who was often tasked as the agency's principal deputy director to handle difficult problems at the NIH.",
      "\"Larry was brilliant at deflecting credit away from himself in order to raise up colleagues, mentees, and those who might otherwise have lacked a voice,\" posted Carrie Wolinetz, a former senior adviser to the NIH director.",
      "In addition to his administrative duties, Tabak also continued to lead a team within the NIH publishing biochemistry research.",
      "Jordan Lara, a research fellow in Tabak's lab at the NIH, praised him for having \"always made time\" for mentorship and scientific research.",
      "\"He would work 80 hours a week regularly with no days off. He truly gave himself up for the American public. it's absolutely insane to have him cast out like this and to paint him as anything other than a dedicated public servant,\" said Lara in a message.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Collectors said the value of certain pennies could rise if the U.S. Treasury stopped manufacturing the coin.",
    "story": [
      "Can a penny saved finally be truly worth it? Collectors are asking that question this week after President Trump ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to stop minting the penny.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in Truth Social post on Sunday. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"",
      "Every penny costs 3.7 cents to manufacture and the U.S. Treasury lost $85.3 million in 2024 producing them, the U.S. Mint reported. Congress sets currency specifications, so it's unclear whether Mr. Trump has the power to eliminate the penny, but the president might be able to stop the Treasury from minting them.",
      "This is key, collectors say, to possibly driving up the price of 2025 pennies and rare pennies currently in circulation.",
      "\"As an avid collector of coins, the coin collecting community is excited as the discontinuation of the penny is a historic event and it brings a renewed interest in rare and valuable editions,\" avid coin collector Scott Evans told CBS News.",
      "He pointed to the rise in interest in Canada's penny after the country discontinued producing the coin in 2012 as a guide for collectors. The Royal Canadian Mint removed at least 6 billion pennies in the first three years after stopping production, depositing them at financial institutions and trucking them from coast to coast to recover their valuable copper and zinc, Canada's government said in a report analyzing its penny removal.",
      "Over 3.5 billion Canadian pennies were returned in the first year alone, and fewer pennies meant more value for the ones left behind. Some valuable pennies include coins from the 1920s \u2014 as most pennies from this decade are hard to find, the Canadian Mint said\u00a0\u2014 and from 1936, when only a few \"dot\" cents are known to exist, making them extremely rare.",
      "This is what bullish collectors hope to see if production stops in the U.S. Evans referenced coins with errors on them or coins with significant dates that might see a big increase in value. Before 1982, pennies were made of 95% copper and 5% zinc, and those made of precious metals might see an increase. He pointed to pennies such as the 1943 Copper Penny or the 1982-D Small Date Copper Penny that might jump in price.",
      "Rare coin and precious metal collector Jonathan Aminov told CBS News he doesn't predict a huge jump in price for the penny.",
      "\"I get calls about pennies all day long,\" said Aminov, who owns Big Apple Coins in Manhattan.",
      "He said the U.S. won't see a foreseeable shortage of pennies anytime because there are too many coins in circulation.",
      "Aminov said collectors might see interest in the 2025 penny because that was the year the coin stopped being minted. If 500 million pennies were ordered for the year and 50 million were minted, then those coins are going to be more desirable, he said.",
      "He also cautioned that it would be difficult to obtain big prices for pennies as the coin would have to be extremely rare saying, \"Pennies are a bit of a longshot.\"",
      "However, the end of penny production can bring new interest and collectors into a hobby that Aminov says could be a good thing. And once someone is hooked on coin collecting it's hard to get out, he says.",
      "\"It's easy to fall in love with coins,\" said Aminov. \"And the people who love it really, really love it. They spend obscene amounts of money to purchase their coin and then stare at it for hours in love with its beauty and history.\"",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Russian cybercriminal and crypto fraudster will be sent back to Moscow as part of a prisoner swap that on Tuesday brought American Marc Fogel home after more than three years in Russian custody.",
      "Alexander Vinnik in 2024 entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The 45-year-old operated BTC-e, at one point one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Prosecutors said BTC-e was a valuable tool for criminals looking to move or launder money. They said BTC-e pocketed $121 million from \"numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Vinnik would be exchanged for Fogel and would be returning to Russia.",
      "\"Vinnik was a nonviolent crypto criminal, and as part of this exchange, he has forfeited more than $100 million that he obtained in that illegal crime,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017, the first year of President Trump's first administration. British cryptocurrency analysis firm Elliptic claimed in a 2020 report that BTC-e may have been used to finance cyber attacks in 2015 and 2016 targeting the Democratic National Committee.",
      "The practice of using cryptocurrency to fund Russian cyber attacks was described in a report by special counsel Robert Mueller III, who investigated the country's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Mueller's investigation did not find the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government.",
      "Vinnik's name has since been included in a series of negotiations that led to prisoner exchanges between the U.S. and Russia.",
      "He was due to be sentenced in June 2025.",
      "Alameda County Santa Rita jail, the California detention center where Vinnik was being held, told CBS News that he had been released from custody there on Feb. 10.",
      "Vinnik's lawyers told CBS News in a statement that a recent hearing had taken place in federal court, but that they were unable to share more details.",
      "\"We can only note that professional legal defense, high-quality political analysis, and appropriate lobbying mechanisms can sometimes have a significant impact on the course of events,\" Vinnik's lawyer said. \"The sentencing in this case has been postponed multiple times, largely due to the political landscape, where certain administrative changes may play in favor of our client.\"",
      "Vinnik's lawyer earlier confirmed he was still in the U.S.",
      "His lawyers claimed in a 2023 court filing that the U.S. at one point offered to trade Vinnik in exchange for basketball star Brittney Griner, \"but the exchange took a different turn.\"",
      "Ultimately, the deal came for an American who had similarly watched as others from his country were sent home in deal after deal. Marc Fogel, a schoolteacher who had been held in Russia since 2021, stepped on U.S. soil late Tuesday night.",
      "The 63-year-old\u00a0whose family had tirelessly advocated for his release was brought to the White House, where he met Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other leaders.",

    "summary": "Arizona has set an execution date for a convicted killer on death row, marking the state's return to the death penalty after more than a decade of issues.",
    "story": [
      "Arizona has scheduled an execution date for a condemned inmate whose death sentence the state originally planned to carry out in early 2023. This would mark Arizona's first execution since then, if is carried out as intended.",
      "Aaron Brian Gunches was convicted in 2007 of fatally shooting his girlfriend's ex-husband, Ted Price, five years earlier in a Phoenix suburb. He also shot a trooper twice when the Arizona Department of Public Safety pulled him over near the California border in 2003, according to authorities. Casings taken from the trooper's bullet proof vest, which saved him, matched casings found at the scene of Price's killing.",
      "Gunches, now 53, was put on death row after pleading guilty to Price's murder. The inmate recently said his death sentence was \"long overdue,\" the Associated Press reported.",
      "In a statement, Price's sister, Karen Price, described her brother as a kind and loving person who enjoyed watching the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks and riding his motorcycle.",
      "Price expressed relief now that the execution warrant has been issued. Her brother's two children, teenagers at the time of his death, were forever changed, she said.",
      "\"It's impossible to describe how Ted's murder has devastated our family,\" Price said.",
      "Arizona paused executions in 2022 to review and improve death penalty procedures, officials said at the time. As Gunches' original execution date approached the following year, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs delayed it and said Arizona was unprepared to enforce the death penalty, due to a shortage of corrections staff with expertise to carry out executions and the state's lack of a pharmacy contract needed for lethal injection drugs. The state's attorney general, also a Democrat, agreed not to pursue executions while the state's death penalty protocol was under review.",
      "No executions were carried out in Arizona between 2014 and 2022 after the state faced severe public scrutiny in the wake of a notoriously prolonged lethal injection that lawyers said was botched. After briefly resuming executions in 2022, Arizona again saw criticism for taking\u00a0too long to insert an IV\u00a0for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner.",
      "Arizona's death penalty review ended in November when Hobbs dismissed the retired federal magistrate judge she had appointed to examine execution procedures.",
      "A spokesperson said then that the review resulted in critical improvements to meet legal and constitutional standards, and that the governor \"remains committed to upholding the law while ensuring justice is carried out in a way that's transparent and humane.\"",
      "Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement to CBS News at the time that she intended to seek a death warrant for Gunches.",
      "\"I am confident that executions can now proceed in compliance with state and federal law,\" Mayes said in the statement.",
      "Gunches, who isn't a lawyer but is representing himself, had asked the court in late December to skip legal formalities and schedule his lethal injection earlier than authorities had planned, saying his death sentence was \"long overdue.\" The state Supreme Court rejected his request.",

      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",

      "As a West Texas county is dealing with a measles outbreak, experts are reminding Americans outbreaks like these can be avoided with safe, effective and available vaccines.",
      "Health officials confirmed Tuesday that\u00a0two dozen people have been identified with measles in Gaines County, Texas, which has one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the entire state. All of the confirmed measles cases in the county involve unvaccinated residents, and nine patients have been hospitalized.",
      "\"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins, told CBS News\u00a0on Wednesday. \"What we're seeing is, one of the places in Texas \u2014 it has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination \u2014 having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.\"",
      "Adalja said this should act as a reminder that measles is still a risk when proper precautions aren't taken.",
      "\"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans. And when we start to see measles outbreak, that's a sign that there is a chink in the armor of vaccination and the fact that it's preventable, I think, is what people should understand. This doesn't have to happen if we can get vaccination rates back to high levels again.\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "\"If somebody is fully vaccinated against measles and has a normal immune system, they don't need to worry about measles,\" said Adalja. \"You're not going to be at risk for contracting measles because the vaccine the vaccine is very, very effective.\"",

      "\"I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" the president wrote on Truth Social\u00a0Wednesday morning. \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the \"great benefit that we will someday have in working together\" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

      "Speaking in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted roughly an hour, and said the two leaders would likely meet in Saudi Arabia for their first sitdown of his new term. He told reporters that Putin \"wants peace\" and \"wants to see it end.\" Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon after his call with the Russian leader. Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X that \"[n]o one wants peace more than Ukraine\" and that Ukraine is \"charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.\" Mr. Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social that the conversation with Zelenskyy went \"very well\" and said it's \"time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's conversation with Putin came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed to undercut\u00a0key Ukrainian positions in eventual peace talks, including by ruling out eventual membership in NATO. Speaking ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contract Group about more aid, Hegseth said peace in the country must include security guarantees that \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief also said Ukraine's goal of returning to its borders before 2014, when Russia first invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, was an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The president, too, has addressed the prospect of Russia maintaining control of Ukrainian territory its forces have occupied, suggesting in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday that Ukraine \"may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also said he is \"OK\" with taking the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO off the table. \"I don't think it's practical,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump frequently claims that Russia would not have launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago if he were president and vowed on the campaign trail to quickly bring an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet\u00a0with Ukraine's Zelenskyy at a security conference in Munich that begins Friday.",
      "The president has been a vehement critic of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, prompting concerns from Kyiv that assistance would stop flowing with him back in office. He told Fox News that aid could depend on Ukraine agreeing a trade deal that gives the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",

      "A record number of journalists were killed in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said\u00a0in a report released Wednesday.",
      "At least 124 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide, and about two-thirds of them were Palestinians who were killed by Israel during its war against Hamas in Gaza, the CPJ said.",
      "The previous record was 113 journalists killed, in 2007, during the Iraq War.",
      "Other countries including Sudan, Pakistan, Mexico and Syria also had multiple cases of journalists killed last year, the report found.",
      "The CPJ considers a journalist or media worker someone who covered news or commented on public affairs, in any medium. To be included on its list, the person's death must have been work-related. The deaths can be deliberate or accidental, such as if a journalist is killed in a conflict zone. A journalist's death would not be included if there is evidence they were \"inciting violence with imminent effect or directly participating as\u00a0combatants\u00a0in armed conflict at the time of their deaths,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ says it only includes confirmed cases in its report, meaning it found evidence indicating the journalist was killed in connection with their work; it says it considers all war-zone cases as confirmed.",
      "Increased global conflict leads to record deaths",
      "Of the 124 journalists who were killed in 2024, the CPJ report said 82 were killed amid the war in Gaza\u00a0and three were\u00a0killed in Lebanon, where Israel was fighting Hezbollah. In at least 10 cases, CPJ says its investigation determined they were \"deliberately targeted.\" The group says it continues investigating whether at least 20 other cases may have been deliberate.",
      "Thirty-one of the journalists killed in Gaza were Palestinian freelancers who the CPJ said \"stepped in to fill the information void after many news outlets ceased to operate\" in the territory.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Israeli officials for comment on the report. In a statement to Reuters, the Israel Defense Forces said it takes measures to mitigate harm to civilians and reporters, and said, \"The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\"",
      "The IDF has previously denied accusations of targeting reporters, telling \"60 Minutes\" in a statement last month: \"The IDF directs its strikes only towards military targets and military operatives, and does not target civilian objects and civilians, including media organizations and journalists as such.\"",
      "Israel's military went on to allege that \"terror operatives\" in Gaza have doubled as journalists and might therefore become \"legitimate military targets,\" including some who work for Al Jazeera. The Qatari network has strongly denied this allegation.",
      "The uptick in journalist deaths comes amid a rising number of conflicts globally, the CPJ said. The other journalist killings in 2024 occurred in over a dozen countries, including Sudan, Pakistan and Mexico. Sudan and Pakistan saw six journalist killings each, while Mexico had five. Four journalists were killed in Syria. Three died in Myanmar, where underground reporters are \"increasingly treated as enemy combatants,\" according to the CPJ. Another three journalist deaths were recorded in Iraq, marking the first journalist deaths there since 2020. Two journalists were killed in Haiti, where \"gangs now openly claim responsibility for journalist killings,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ said that it found countries where journalists are deliberately killed often try to \"bury evidence of killings, shift blame, and avoid accountability.\" Such actions put surviving journalists in even more danger, the group said, and remove \"the possibility of justice\" for those who have died.",
      "Around the world, journalists have also been intimidated, censored and arrested or assaulted. Such incidents were reported in Cameroon, Somalia and Afghanistan, even though there were no journalists killed in those countries.

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the U.S. will no longer be the \"primary guarantor of security in Europe,\" which he said must step up to secure Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia must include security guarantees for Ukraine, but that they \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief spoke not long before President Trump announced in a social media post that he had agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, during a phone call with the Russian leader on Wednesday. He said he would be calling Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately \"to inform him of the conversation.\"",
      "In remarks delivered ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to discuss further aid for Ukraine, Hegseth called Ukraine's goal of returning to its pre-2014 borders \u2014 before Russian forces first invaded and started seizing ground, annexing the Crimean Peninsula \u2014 an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The U.S. defense chief said \"as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed\" to Ukraine.",
      "Furthermore, he said any peacekeeping troops deployed to Ukraine should not be part of a NATO mission, nor covered by Article 5, the alliance's mutual defense pact.",
      "Around 50 countries make up the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which has provided support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.",
      "Hegseth said that, moving forward, Europe should \"provide the overwhelming share of lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine,\" and urged those in attendance at the Brussels summit to speak to their governments about increasing their defense spending, as the U.S. shifts its focus elsewhere.",
      "Hegseth says U.S. won't be \"primary guarantor of security in Europe\"",
      "\"I'm also here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being the primary guarantor of security in Europe,\" Hegseth said, stressing that the U.S. would be focusing on its own border security and China.",
      "\"The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail. As the United States shifts its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The Ukraine Defense Contact Group in total has provided Ukraine with over $126 billion in military assistance and weapons, the Associated Press reported. The United States has provided $66.5 billion of that and has chaired the group since its inception. It is unclear who will chair the next meeting.",
      "\"We hear you,\" the United Kingdom's Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's remarks.",
      "Mr. Trump promised that he would quickly end the war in Ukraine when he took office earlier this year, and he's often complained about it being too costly to U.S. taxpayers.",
      "In his remarks, Hegseth said the U.S. and Europe \"can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and the Pacific respectively,\" but that it \"will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on this continent.\"",
      "\"The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to partnership with Europe,\" Hegseth said. \"But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its security.\"",

      "The White House released a photo of a jubilant Fogel disembarking a plane at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Alongside him were White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's envoy for hostages.",
      "He was then taken to the White House, where he was greeted outside on the North Portico by President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, among others.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that a Russian citizen who was behind bars in the U.S. had been freed as part of the swap that included Fogel's release. Peskov said the Russian's identity would be disclosed once he or she was back in Russia.",
      "In a briefing with reporters alongside Mr. Trump in the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House, Fogel said, \"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now.\" He called the president \"a hero\" for facilitating his return.",
      "\"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world,\" Fogel said.",
      "Mr. Trump would not say how the U.S. and Russia reached the deal securing Fogel's freedom, only describing the terms as \"very fair, very reasonable.\" The president also teased that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of.\"",
      "Mr. Trump declined to say if he spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of Fogel's release, but late Wednesday morning, he\u00a0posted on social media that he had just had \"a lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with the Russian leader. He said the two \"discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\" And he said he thanked Putin for releasing Fogel.",
      "The president said in his post that the two agreed to \"work together, very closely, including visiting each other's Nations\" and would begin negotiations \"immediately\" to end the war in Ukraine, and he added that he would be calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to inform him of his conversation with Putin. He said he has asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Ambassador and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff to lead the negotiations.",
      "Witkoff offered some detail to reporters Wednesday morning. He said the deal had come together in the last few days and included the involvement of Ratcliffe, Waltz, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. Witkoff said Mr. Trump \"has a very strong relationship\" with bin Salman. The Saudi leader \"was encouraging and pushing and looking for the right result,\" Witkoff said. \"And it was helpful. It really was.\"",
      "When he departed for Russia, Witkoff said he wasn't certain whether Fogel would be released \u2014 Mr. Trump had told him, \"Let's get over there and see if we can finish it.\"",
      "He recounted receiving a call saying Fogel would be at the airport \u2014 Witkoff declined to identify the caller \u2014 and he subsequently called Mr. Trump, who urged him to \"get over there fast.\" He said he spent six or seven hours on the ground in Russia but declined to say whether he met or spoke with Putin.",
      "\"President Putin had to pardon [Fogel] and had to approve it, so, that that evidently happened,\" Witkoff said. Upon seeing Fogel, he told him, \"You're close to U.S. territory now.\" Once Witkoff's plane was de-iced, they departed. Upon leaving Russian airspace, they called Fogel's family. Fogel \"was doing a jig,\" Witkoff said. When they landed at Joint Base Andrews, \"I think he began singing,\" he added.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump greeted Fogel and gave him and Witkoff a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom.",
      "Fogel was serving a 14-year sentence in Russia and was\u00a0designated as \"wrongfully detained\"\u00a0by the U.S. late last year.",
      "\"President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,\" he said in a statement. \"Since President Trump's swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States.\"",

      "Why was Marc Fogel detained?",
      "Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested by Russian authorities at the airport in Moscow in 2021. His family had said he was carrying 17 grams of marijuana for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",
      "In addition to Fogel, that deal omitted several other Americans imprisoned in Russia, including musician\u00a0Michael Travis Leake, U.S. Army staff sergeant\u00a0Gordon Black\u00a0and Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina.",
      "In a statement, Fogel's family thanked Mr. Trump and other allies who fought for his release.",
      "\"We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,\" they said. \"Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs. This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "\"I am thrilled that Marc Fogel is finally coming home after years of being wrongfully held in Russia,\" McCormick, a Republican, said in a post. \"I have been working with the administration on this since day one and I'm grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rubio for delivering on their commitment to free Marc. As I told Marc's Mom, Mafa, when we spoke in August, we had to do everything possible to get Marc home and it is a blessing that this day has finally come.\"",
      "Fogel's mother, Malphine Fogel, had criticized Biden and his administration for the delay in designating her son as wrongfully detained. That determination that is made by the secretary of state and clears the way for State Department offices and federal agencies to work together to develop a plan to secure the release of a detainee.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against the State Department last June, but the case was dismissed. Malphine Fogel was set to draw more public attention to her son's detainment during a July 13 rally with Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, but the campaign event was upended when a gunman opened fire on the crowd. The president and two others were injured, and one man was killed during the assassination attempt.",
      "\"I was going to be on stage with him and he was going to mention [Marc's] name,\" Malphine Fogel told CBS News Pittsburgh last July. \"We were going to put it out for the whole world to hear. Well, that didn't happen because we didn't get on stage.\"",

      "The latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File, a database run by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida, showed that shark attacks decreased dramatically in 2024 and was far below the annual average.",
      "\"Unprovoked shark bites plummeted in 2024,\" reads the headline of the report, which characterized the year as \"exceptionally calm\" for shark bites.",
      "Of 88 alleged shark-human interactions that researchers say they investigated last year, 71 bites were confirmed. The report segmented those incidents into unprovoked and provokes bites, of which there were 47 and 24, respectively. Seven of the attacks were fatal, including four unprovoked attacks, according to the research.",
      "Those figures did not account for instances where sharks attacked a boat or bit a human who was already dead. Several additional incidents where a person's injuries could not be indisputably attributed to a shark, over another predatory marine creature, were categorized as \"unconfirmed\" in the report.",
      "Confirmed attacks in 2024 dwarfed numbers reported in the previous year's International Shark Attack File, which recognized 91 global incidents, including 69 unprovoked bites and 22 provoked bites. Ten people died in shark attacks in 2023, with six killed in unprovoked attacks, researchers said at the time.",
      "The number of attacks last year was \"well below\" the 10-year average, of about 70 unprovoked shark bites recorded annually, the new report notes. It also calls the four unprovoked attacks a \"significant reduction\" compared with previous years.",
      "Our annual shark bite report for 2024 is now available online.

      "The International Shark Attack File considers attacks on a living human in the shark's natural habitat, who did not bother the animal prior to being bitten, \"unprovoked.\" It considers attacks that occur after a human has initiated some sort of contact with the shark \"provoked.\"",
      "Divers suffering bites after trying to touch or otherwise harass sharks, attacks on spearfishermen, bites on people who attempted to feed sharks, and bites that happen while a shark is being unhooked or removed from a fishing net, are some examples of scenarios that would meet criteria for a \"provoked\" attack.",
      "Unprovoked bites are of particular interest to the researchers studying shark attack patterns.",
      "\"We're interested in the natural patterns of shark behavior so that we can understand why people occasionally get bitten by these animals,\" said Gavin Naylor, the director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, in a statement. \"Any cue or attribute that modifies an animal's natural behavior is something that, we as scientists, want to exclude.\"",
      "Places with the most unprovoked shark attacks",
      "Most of 2024's unprovoked shark attacks happened in the United States, which follows a longstanding pattern, the new report notes. Last year, there were 28 confirmed shark bites in U.S. waters, accounting for 60% of the worldwide total despite being lower than the 36 unprovoked incidents confirmed in 2023.",
      "Half of U.S. attacks took place in Florida in 2024, which is also common for the state often known to experience the highest concentrations of shark bites of anywhere in the world. Like the national total, unprovoked shark bites were down in Florida, where the five-year average is 19 unprovoked attacks.",
      "Australia trailed the U.S. total with nine unprovoked bites, a sizable decrease from the country's five-year average of 15. Egypt, the Maldives, Western Sahara, the Turks and Caicos Islands, French Polynesia, Mozambique, India, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Belize each reported one unprovoked shark attack.",
      "The fatal attacks occurred in the U.S., Egypt, the Maldives and Western Sahara, with one death confirmed in each place, according to the Shark Attack File. Despite Florida's tally of unprovoked bites, the only U.S. death in a shark attack last year happened in Hawaii when surfer Tamayo Perry was killed off the island of Oahu.

    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns in West Africa, which supplies around 70% of the world's cacao, are disrupting the crop, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "As Valentine's Day approaches, the craving for chocolate intensifies. But chocolate continues to face a significant challenge: Climate change is threatening cacao production, particularly in West Africa, which produces around 70% of the world's supply. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns are disrupting cacao crops, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
      "Cocoa prices surged 136% between July 2022 and February 2024, according to UNCTAD commodities price monitoring. For the first time, the price per metric ton on the futures market crossed $10,000 last March, according to the United Nations trade agency, which attributed the increases in part to climate change.",
      "A new analysis by scientists at research nonprofit Climate Central highlights how climate change has pushed temperatures above the optimal range for cacao trees in Western Africa. This analysis is \"the first that we know of that really tries to put a number on how much humans and climate change are influencing cocoa trees and cocoa production from West Africa,\" said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central.",
      "West African countries have long been the heart of cocoa production, producing around 3.48 million metric tons of cocoa beans in the 2022-2023 season. This massive output is vital to the global chocolate industry, where it takes about 400 cocoa beans to make just one pound of chocolate. Millions of farmers depend on the crop for their livelihoods. In Ghana, cocoa production provides employment for 3.2 million farmers and workers, more than 10% of its total population. \"Climate change is threatening the existence of cocoa farmers and their sources of livelihoods,\" says cocoa farmer Emmanuel Essah-Mensah from Ghana, who advises several hundred cocoa farms.",
      "Cacao trees are grown in regions within 10 degrees north and south of the equator where the climate is ideal for its cultivation. The crop \u2014 the raw, unprocessed form of cocoa beans \u2014 has two primary harvest periods in Western Africa: the main crop harvest from September to March and the mid-crop from May to August. After flowering, it takes about five to six months for the pods to mature. Once ripe, the pods are harvested by hand and then split open to extract the seeds, which undergo fermentation and drying processes to develop the flavors essential for chocolate production.",
      "The ideal temperature range for cacao growth is up to 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 Fahrenheit, but recent trends indicate that climate change is increasing the number of days above this range. Climate Central examined temperature data from 44 cacao-producing districts, regions, or states in West Africa, including Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. Over the past decade, approximately two-thirds of the cacao-growing region faced an increase of at least an additional six weeks' worth of days each year hotter than is ideal for the trees due to climate change, while one-third experienced at least eight additional weeks of excessive heat.",
      "Excessive heat severely impacts cacao production. Cacao plants rely on stable temperatures for proper photosynthesis, and too many hot days can affect photosynthesis, leading to shriveled flowers and smaller, rotting cacao pods.",
      "The impact of climate change extends beyond heat stress. Cacao trees are also sensitive to rainfall patterns. Cacao thrives when rainfall totals between 1,500 and 2,000 millimeters, or about 59 to 79 inches annually, with no dry spells longer than three months, according to the International Cocoa Organization . In July 2024, parts of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire saw 40% more rainfall than usual, flooding fields and damaging crops, while December brought little rain to the region, which slows photosynthesis, leading to fewer flowers and more underdeveloped beans. Erratic rainfall patterns are leaving farmers with unpredictable growing conditions, contributing to lower harvests and higher prices.",
      "To adapt, some farmers are turning to diverse, nature-friendly agricultural practices, such as planting taller trees between cacao plants, creating healthy fertile soils that hold onto moisture and providing protective shade for cacao plants. However, such strategies are not foolproof and can take time to implement. The future of cacao farming in a warming world remains uncertain, and ongoing challenges threaten to continue driving up the price of chocolate, making your favorite sweet treat pricier to enjoy."

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday and renewed his suggestions that Gaza could be emptied of residents, controlled by the U.S. and redeveloped as a tourist area \u2014 a plan that would likely only work if the Arab nation agrees to accept more Palestinian refugees.",
      "The pair met in the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump suggested he would not withhold U.S. aid to Jordan, Egypt or other Arab nations if they don't agree to dramatically increase the number of people they take in from Gaza.",
      "\"I don't have to threaten that. I do believe we're above that,\" Mr. Trump said. That contradicted his previous suggestion that holding back aid was a possibility.",
      "Abdullah was asked repeatedly about Mr. Trump's audacious plan to remake the Middle East, but didn't make substantive comments in the Oval Office on it, nor the idea that his country could accept large numbers of new refugees from Gaza. He did say that Jordan would accept roughly 2,000 children with cancer and other health problems \"right away.\" Mr. Trump said he did not know about that commitment, which he called \"a beautiful gesture.\"",
      "After their meeting, however, in a series of social media posts, King Abdullah \"reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\"",
      "\"This is the unified Arab position,\" he said. \"Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability. This requires US leadership. President Trump is a man of peace. He was instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire. We look to US and all stakeholders in ensuring it holds.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also repeated suggestions, during their meeting, that the U.S. could come to control Gaza, but that it wouldn't require committing American funds. Asked under what authority he could take control of the territory, he said: \"under the U.S. authority,\" without elaborating.",
      "\"We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it,\" Mr. Trump said of Gaza. He suggested the redeveloped area could have new hotels, office buildings and houses and, \"and we'll make it exciting.\"",
      "\"I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it,\" said Mr. Trump, who built a New York real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, while also insisting that he personally would not be involved in the development.",
      "Mr. Trump also renewed his suggestion during his meeting with Abdullah that the tenuous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel could be ended if Hamas doesn't release all the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday \u2014 a deadline that's not in line with the ceasefire terms agreed to by the parties.",
      "\"I don't think they're going to make the deadline, personally,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas. \"They want to play tough guy. We'll see how tough they are.\"",
      "The king's visit came at a perilous moment for the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas accused Israel this week of violating the truce and said it was delaying further hostage releases under the agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations, with no right of return.",
      "His Tuesday comments contradicted his Monday suggestions that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt \u2014 longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid \u2014 as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",
      "But asked in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, \"No, they wouldn't.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:11:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, one expert said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",
      "\"The experience that [the United States has] on civil nuclear energy will give us all of the tools we need to train our people, to train our Salvadoran experts, who will lead the technical and regulatory aspects of this transition \u2014 this unprecedented transition,\" Hill Tonoco said.",
      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",
      "\"This is something that probably will not happen during the Trump administration, and it will take a long time to materialize, if it materializes,\" Monaldi said.",

    "story": [
      "Italian police arrested almost 150 people Tuesday in a major operation against the Sicilian mafia in Palermo, areas of which remain in the grip of powerful Cosa Nostra clans.",
      "Warrants were issued against a total of 183 people, 36 of whom were already in custody, for crimes including mafia-type criminal association, attempted murder, extortion, drug trafficking and illegal gambling, police said.",
      "More than 1,200 officers were involved in dawn raids, in what media reports said was the biggest operation against the Cosa Nostra since 1984.",
      "The Sicilian mafia, the inspiration for the \"Godfather\" movies, is no longer the force it once was, subject to years of crackdowns by authorities and overtaken in terms of power and wealth by Calabria's 'Ndrangheta.",
      "But Palermo police said their two-year probe had revealed how it \"continues to maintain its grip,\" these days coordinated by messages on encrypted smartphones.",
      "Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed the operation, which she said \"confirms the state's constant commitment to the fight against organized crime.\"",
      "Palermo Mayor Roberto Lagalla also praised the operation, saying in a statement that the arrests \"dealt a historic blow to the mafia.\"",
      "Mafia \"exercises constant control\"",
      "Tuesday's operation was aimed at dismantling Mafia clans in several districts of the Sicilian capital Palermo and its surrounding areas, after an investigation that provides an insight into how they operate.",
      "Police described how the clans cooperated on drug trafficking -- a major source of income -- while also working with mobsters elsewhere in Sicily, and with the 'Ndrangheta on the Italian mainland.",
      "Within its territory, the mafia \"exercises constant control,\" police said.",
      "As in decades past, they demand \"pizzo\", or protection money, from businesses, and force traders to use their products, often at inflated prices.",
      "In one example, investigators revealed how a clan took control of distributing mussels and other seafood to restaurants in two seaside villages.",
      "While Cosa Nostra bosses these days try to resolve disputes peacefully to avoid attracting attention, weapons were found in Tuesday's blitz, police said, while reporting incidents of brutal beatings.",
      "The old rules of top-down organization and membership until death still hold sway but police said clan leaders were \"up to date,\" using encrypted smartphones to communicate to avoid traditional meetings.",
      "And despite numerous arrests over the years, the Sicilian mafia \"still manages to attract a large number of young people who embrace its principles\" and offer to work for them, police said. Last\u00a0 March, Italy\u00a0expanded a controversial program\u00a0to remove children from their mafia families to break the cycle of criminal behavior being passed down to new generations.",
      "The new investigation also revealed a wide network of informants, with a clerk in the Palermo prosecutors office arrested last November accused of passing on files.",
      "The Sicilian Mafia for many years terrorized the Italian public and state, notorious for the killings anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.",
      "But that led to a fierce state clampdown and the 'Ndrangheta is now considered Italy's wealthiest and most powerful mafia, which controls the bulk of cocaine flowing into Europe.",
      "Matteo Messina Denaro, the convicted mastermind of some of the Cosa Nostra  mafia's most heinous slayings, died in Sept. 2023, several months after being\u00a0captured as Italy's No. 1 fugitive\u00a0and following decades on the run.",
      "But Italy's mafia still wields influence that extends from tourism to prisons. In December, a research institute warned that Italy's mafias make more than three billion euros a year from the tourism sector. That same month, a\u00a0Catholic nun was arrested\u00a0by Italian police for allegedly bringing messages for the mafia to prisoners.",

      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",

      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",
      "If convicted, each wire fraud-related charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each computer damage count has a maximum penalty of 10 years. The remaining counts each have a maximum penalty of five years.",
      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals. Recently, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn was arrested and extradited on charges related to his alleged administration of Phobos ransomware. European and German authorities also announced an operation involving the FBI and other law enforcement partners that had disrupted over 100 servers associated with the criminal network Berezhnoy and Glebov were a part of, the Department of Justice said.",

      "Justin Baldoni alleges Blake Lively's intentions in filing a civil rights complaint instead of a lawsuit \"were deliberate.\"",
      "Lively, 37, initially filed a complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department Dec. 21, accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment while working on \"It Ends With Us.\" She also claimed that after raising concerns, he, along with a crisis PR team, orchestrated a retaliation campaign aimed at ruining her career.",
      "Baldoni, 41, launched a website that included an amended version of his $400 million defamation lawsuit against his co-star and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, which included an updated suit and timeline of events to counter claims she was sexually harassed on set of the drama for which he served as director.",

By the time Lively actually filed a lawsuit against the Wayfarer Parties, the damage to the Wayfarer Parties was done by virtue of Lively\u2019s months of colluding with the New York Times on a false and malicious narrative unshielded by any privilege. Make no mistake: these actions were deliberate.\"",
      "Celebrity attorney Christopher C. Melcher exclusively told Fox News Digital Baldoni had \"a very good reason\" to make the claim that Lively's actions were intentional.",
      "\"Because it was just a request for the government to investigate and not a lawsuit against Baldoni, he had no right to subpoena witnesses or force Blake or Ryan to sit for a deposition,\" Melcher said. \"The suspicion is that she leaked this request for investigation to the media with all of these text messages on there so that she could garner public sympathy but not be exposed to any scrutiny for her allegations.\"",

      "Melcher specified the importance of Baldoni stating Lively \"never intended to file a civil lawsuit\" in his amended lawsuit shared online.",
      "\"Ordinarily, if somebody makes a false statement against somebody, it's defamation, and you can get sued,\" Melcher said. \"But if the statement is made in a lawsuit or in contemplation of an immediate suit being filed, it is protected under the litigation privilege \u2013 that's Civil Code, Section 47.",
      "\"So, California Civil Code, Section 47 says statements made by a party in the course of a lawsuit are not defamatory, they're not actionable. You can't sue for defamation. And that's been interpreted to mean, 'OK, well, literally, if you're filing tomorrow, and you're maybe given a press release or demand letter, you can be covered under that umbrella that has to be immediately contemplated.'",
      "\"So, this \u2018never intended\u2019 is the code word for him saying that the leaks to the press are not covered by this litigation privilege because they were not made in the context of a lawsuit, and so that's what gives him the right to sue. Otherwise, he would be blocked.\"",

      "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet.",
      "Meat enthusiasts have long endorsed the \"carnivore diet,\" a meal plan that includes consuming only animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs \u2014 but the program is frowned upon by some who embrace plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Siegel instead recommends opting for the Mediterranean diet, which is heavy in vegetables, nuts and olive oil. \"With its unsaturated fats and antioxidants, it is much healthier,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, said she has found carnivore diets to be \"indispensable tools\" in her clinical practice.",
      "The diet could potentially help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, quiet food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus, according to Ede.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern \u2026 is ideal for everyone.\"",
      "Ede added, \"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us.\"",

      "The doctor did acknowledge that adhering to carnivore diets poses potential challenges.",
      "\"These include the potential for boredom that can come from the relative lack of variety, the social challenges of eating in a way that may make others feel uncomfortable, and the logistical challenges of finding meat, seafood, poultry, and/or egg dishes prepared simply enough to be suitable for the diet, especially when traveling or eating at others\u2019 homes,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "Make it difficult for a romance scammer to target you",
      "Your personal information is a scammer\u2019s best tool. This includes your phone number, email and other contact details that allow them to reach you, as well as information like the celebrities you follow, your family members and even the type of content you engage with online to tailor the perfect attack. As scams become more sophisticated and reliant on loads of data, it\u2019s more important than ever to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal information.",
      "1. Vigilance in online dating: In the digital world, not everyone is who they claim to be. Be wary of potential romantic interests who ask for money or gifts or those who want to move the relationship along too quickly. Keep your personal and financial information private and never share it with someone you haven't met in person.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Verify the identity: Request additional information or proof to verify their identity, such as video chatting or meeting in person if possible. Exercise caution before getting emotionally invested in someone you haven't met in real life.",
      "3. Research and verify: Conduct an online search using the person's name, email address or phone number to see if any suspicious or fraudulent activities are associated with them.\u00a0Reverse image search their profile pictures to check if they are stolen from elsewhere on the internet. You can also reverse-search their phone number for free by following the instructions found\u00a0here.",
      "4. Privacy settings: Keep your social media profiles private so only those you trust can see what\u2019s going on in your life.",
      "5. Limit sharing: Adjust the privacy settings on all of your online accounts and apps to limit data collection and sharing.",
      "6. Use reputable dating platforms: Stick to well-known and reputable dating websites or apps with security measures to help protect their users from scams. These platforms often have guidelines for safe online dating and report suspicious users.",
      "7. Invest in personal information removal services:\u00a0I highly recommend you remove your personal information that can be found on various people search sites across the web. If you give someone your email address or phone number, they could potentially reverse-search your information and get your home address.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",

(ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",

They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",

      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",

      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",

If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams.

If you receive something that looks like a ticket but doesn't have the court's full address or phone number \u2013 or worse, it says \"Do not contact the court\" \u2013 you might be dealing with what's cheekily called a \"snitch ticket.\" These aren't real tickets at all but rather attempts to get you to rat out whoever was actually driving.

So, when the footage is too blurry to ID the driver, they toss out these \"Whoops, was this you?\" tickets, hoping you\u2019ll do their homework for them.

For example, Uber stores your location data to help you find a ride faster, while WhatsApp requires access to your contacts so you can send messages.",
      "The real issue is data collection that serves no purpose other than showing you ads or selling your information to third parties.

      "What makes this concerning is how deeply embedded these apps are in our daily lives, making it nearly impossible to find alternatives or avoid data collection altogether.",
      "The list also includes Elon Musk\u2019s X at No. 5, followed by Uber Eats, PayPal, Uber, Google and Amazon Prime Video. TikTok, despite ongoing scrutiny over its data policies, ranks 14th.

      "If you\u2019re not able to delete the apps listed above, follow the simple steps below to minimize how much information is being collected and shared.",
      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone.

Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",

      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",
      "A healthcare worker looking at information on his phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "CHC's response",
      "CHC said the hacker\u2019s access was terminated within hours, and daily operations were not disrupted. To strengthen cybersecurity, CHC claims it has implemented advanced monitoring software and reinforced system protections. The organization said there is no evidence at this time that the compromised data has been misused.",
      "The health center is offering free identity theft protection services for all patients and COVID-19 service recipients whose Social Security numbers were involved in the breach. The organization is also encouraging individuals whose Social Security numbers were not affected to take additional steps to protect their information.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "According to a reporter for i24 News, Egyptian sources told Qatari Al Araby TV the plan is a move to counter the proposal first put forward by President Donald Trump last week suggesting the U.S.\u00a0would \"take over\" Gaza and forcibly displace all Palestinians living there.",

      "Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House last week, Trump outlined his vision for Gaza\u2019s future, describing it as \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\" His proposal to relocate 1.8 million Palestinians sparked outrage among Palestinian leaders and drew mixed reactions from Gazans.",
      "While some Gazans have rejected emigration, others see it as their only hope.",
      "\"I\u2019m asking Donald Trump himself to relocate us as he suggested. And I\u2019ll be the first one to go,\" one young man told the Center for Peace Communications team in Gaza during a camera interview. The man described his bleak reality, saying, \"I want to leave because there\u2019s no life left here. Life here is gone. I mean, just look around you.\"",

      "Joseph Braude, founder and president of the Center for Peace Communications, told Fox News Digital that the number has grown significantly due to the ongoing devastation. \"Through our daily contact with Gazans from all walks of life across the coastal strip, we have seen that proportion grow, amid the destruction of the present war, to a substantial majority of the population.\"",
      "Ayman Khaled, a Palestinian journalist, echoed similar sentiments, pointing to the grim prospects for rebuilding Gaza after months of relentless Israeli bombardment. \"Gaza will need to go through a very long period of reconstruction. In that long period of time, where will the youth go? Where will the wounded go? We have more than 100,000 wounded. Even before the last war, a stream of people were leaving Gaza\u2014workers, students, business people. That\u2019s how it looked then. Now, those trends will double. There is no hope for the reconstruction of Gaza, not in a year nor 10 nor 15.\"",

      "He also warned that as long as Hamas remains in power, cycles of violence will continue, pushing more people to flee. \"If Hamas remains on the scene, this will keep happening. Every day, we\u2019ll have new killings. After every battle, they say they are victorious\u2014but what is this victory? If we don\u2019t seriously address the issue of Hamas leaving the political scene, we cannot talk about anything else. If Hamas remains, people will emigrate, whether willingly or unwillingly.\"",
      "Hamas described Trump's plan as a \"recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region,\" and for many Gazans, leaving is unthinkable. Speaking to The Associated Press, Mustafa al-Gazzar, a displaced Gazan, dismissed the idea of leaving. \"You think you\u2019ll expel me abroad and bring other people in my place? I would rather live in my tent, under rubble. I won\u2019t leave. Put that in your brain.\"",
      "Amna Omar, 71, who has been sheltering in central Gaza, was equally defiant. \"Gaza is our land, our home. We as Gazans\u2026 I don't want to die in Egypt.\"",
      "Another woman in Deir al-Balah told Israeli news agency TPS-IL, \"We clung to our destroyed homes and we clung to the soil of Palestine.\" While voluntary emigration has been quietly discussed for years, Trump\u2019s endorsement has turned it into a divisive issue. Arab governments, wary of being seen as complicit in Palestinian displacement, have been quick to condemn it.",

      "In a video message shared on Instagram, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin reacted to the release of civilians Eli Sharabi, 52; Or Levy, 34, and Ohad Ben Ami, 56. They were among the 250 people who were taken during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The three gaunt, frail-looking Israeli hostages were forced to speak during a Hamas handover ceremony, igniting outrage, as Israel in turn released nearly 200 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday.",
      "\"We received the wonderful news that Eli, Or and Ohad we released today,\" Rachel Goldberg-Polin said in a video shared to the \"Bring.Hersh.Home\" account, which has garnered more than 173,000 followers. \"We also felt this real connection to Or and his family because Or and Hersh were both kidnapped together from the same bomb shelter on the same pickup truck on Oct. 7. And in fact, Or's brother, Mikha'el, contacted us right after Shabbat today to tell us that one of Or's first questions he asked his brother this morning was \u2018how is Hersh doing?\u2019 Because he had assumed that Hersh had been released long ago, and his brother had to explain to him that Hersh had been murdered five months ago.\"",
      "Jon Polin then addressed Trump, as well as U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, imploring them to secure the release of the remaining 76 hostages this week.",

      "\"Seeing the condition of these three hostages, hearing that Or had no idea what happened to Hersh, that Eli was unaware of the fate of his wife and his daughters, is just a gut punch to all of us that we need to do more,\" Jon Polin said. \"And I'm turning directly to President Trump and to Mr. Witkoff, you have shown that you are the only ones who are able to get this situation moving, moving forward, and my plea to you, our plea to you right now is \u2013 now that you've done the hard part in getting movement, getting a deal started, let's not think about Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Phase 3 in many months. Let's think bigger and faster. All 76 hostages out this week. End of war. Who benefits from dragging it out for so long? Not the people of this region. Let's get it done right now. Thank you.\"",

      "When the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau made an appearance in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 blueprint, the conservative group\u2019s plan was simple: Abolish it entirely.",
      "Now, with a Project 2025 co-author in charge of the bureau, that idea looks like a real possibility.",
      "Over the weekend, Russ Vought, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the powerful Office of Management and Budget, took over as de facto head of the agency and subsequently ordered all nonessential work there to stop. Vought is one of more than 30 co-authors of Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint for the Trump administration\u2019s agenda, though he did not write the section on the CFPB.",
      "\u201cThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is arguably the most powerful and unaccountable regulatory agency in existence,\u201d the report states.",
      "Whether the bureau is rendered toothless by its new leadership or abolished by congressional action, its emergence as a target for conservative ire has been years in the making, boosted most recently by technology executives including Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Created by Democrats, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, in the wake of the Great Recession, the CFPB lodged steady but largely unglamorous wins for consumers.",
      "Yet all the while, it faced a drumbeat of opposition from small-government conservatives and business interests who challenged not only its regulations and enforcement actions, but its very basis for existing. Consumer complaints about corporate misbehavior have by some measures reached all-time highs.",
      "\u201cThis is an agency that has an incredible amount of responsibility for regulating in the financial services sector,\u201d said Julie Margetta Morgan, a former associate director at the bureau who started there in 2022 and resigned right after Trump\u2019s second inauguration. She added, \u201cThere are a number of big bank lobbyists who have had it out for the CFPB from Day 1.\u201d",
      "But most recently, some in the tech world \u2014 including those who have become particularly influential with the Trump administration \u2014 have been its loudest critics.",
      "Musk, who leads the administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort, posted \u201cRIP CFPB\u201d on X on Sunday. Andreesen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz, said on a podcast last year that the agency had been \u201cterrorizing financial institutions.\u201d Part of his criticism has centered around \u201cdebanking,\u201d something that the CFPB itself also tried to stop. (In 2021, the CFPB shuttered a lending startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz.)",
      "\u201cThe CFPB works for regular people that don\u2019t run in Elon\u2019s circle,\u201d said one current CFPB employee, who was granted anonymity out of fear of reprisal. \u201cElon doesn\u2019t know single mothers whose cars break down and are scammed by predatory car lenders. He doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be driven into debt by overdraft fees. He doesn\u2019t have a mortgage he is struggling to pay off. So he can\u2019t understand why the CFPB is so important to protect regular folks from being scammed.\u201d",
      "Compared with the vast resources historically commanded by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, not to mention the Federal Trade Commission \u2014 the agency traditionally tasked with enforcing consumer regulations \u2014 the CFPB\u2019s remit was always relatively limited in scope. Notably, its annual budget has never exceeded $1 billion.",
      "It is thus perhaps not surprising that it never landed a proverbial knockout blow that would stick in the minds of the American public. Still, it steadily gained a favorable reputation. In 2015, Time magazine devoted a major feature to the bureau under the headline, \u201cThe Agency That\u2019s Got Your Back.\u201d",
      "Margetta Morgan, the former CFPB associate director, said eliminating medical debt from credit reports has been particularly significant.",
      "\u201cWhen CFPB started digging in on medical debt, it was astounding to see the extent to which consumers had inaccurate medical debt on their credit reports and then were being hounded by debt collectors over them,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the medical debt rulemaking was huge, and we saw that when we spoke to individual consumers.\u201d",
      "Yet as early as 2017, conservatives were charting a path to end the agency altogether. An article that year published by the Heritage Foundation \u2014 the group whose Project 2025 now appears, despite some Trump assurances to the contrary, to be driving much of his second administration\u2019s rollout \u2014 laid out the case against the CFPB\u2019s very existence.",
      "\u201cThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is arguably the most powerful and unaccountable regulatory agency in existence,\u201d the article\u2019s authors wrote, arguing that its rulemaking ultimately restricted Americans\u2019 access to credit while \u201ceroding their financial independence\u201d and posing concerns about due process and separation of powers.",
      "Instead, they said, consumers would enjoy the same protections if the agency\u2019s powers were swept back into the Federal Trade Commission and if existing state and local laws were enforced, they said.",
      "One of the authors, Norbert Michel, today a vice president at the pro-free-market Cato Institute, told NBC News that assuming that malfeasance is taking place \u2014 something he said there is often disagreement about \u2014 enforcement powers already exist at multiple government agencies, not to mention at the state level, to address it.",
      "\u201cIn one sense, you\u2019ve given a new federal agency extreme discretionary power \u2014 and in other sense, done nothing new,\u201d Michel said. \u201cSo somewhere in there you have an increase in government authority that\u2019s not necessary.\u201d",
      "Still, the agency persisted and became particularly active under Rohit Chopra, a Biden appointee, who helped bring actions against many major lenders, as well as financial technology firms and loan servicing groups.",
      "Chopra\u2019s largest action came against Wells Fargo, which paid a $1.7 billion penalty over accusations it improperly repossessed cars and froze customers\u2019 accounts. Chopra also engineered a settlement with Navient, formerly among the nation\u2019s largest student-loan servicers, over allegedly abusive practices.",
      "Yet it was the agency\u2019s recent work around so-called financial technology enterprises that may have created the conditions for its demise. In 2023, it sought to subject large fintech players like PayPal and Venmo to the same supervisory examination process as banks.",
      "Since that time, Musk has made clear he hopes to turn X into a payments platform. X recently announced a deal with Visa to begin processing payments.",
      "\u201cYou have Silicon Valley VCs not wanting any oversight of their businesses, many of which are premised on the idea that [financial technology] somehow is new and different and thus not subject to traditional consumer protections,\u201d said another current CFPB employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Last year, the Supreme Court heard the first challenge to the CFPB\u2019s very existence \u2014\u00a0and decided in its favor, with Justice Clarence Thomas, viewed as among the court\u2019s most conservative members, writing for the 7-2 majority that Congress had been clear in setting up its funding mechanism as a body of the Federal Reserve.",
      "That did not stop the chorus of voices calling for the agency to be reined in. Notably, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 referred to the CFPB as little more than \u201ca shakedown mechanism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency,\u201d Robert Bowes, an official in Trump\u2019s first administration, wrote. \u201cIt is unconstitutional. Congress should abolish the CFPB.\u201d Consumer protection functions, he said, should be returned to banking regulators and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "For consumer advocates, such an outcome would be cataclysmic for everyday Americans.",
      "\u201cThe CFPB protects real people from financial companies ripping them off,\u201d said Erin Witte, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit group. \u201cIf your car has been illegally repossessed by a bank, or if you\u2019ve been the victim of a predatory student loan servicer, or ever had to pay junk fees, the CFPB steps up to make sure a company can\u2019t rip you off.\u201d",
      "Its potential elimination, Witte said, will have \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d and should be \u201cinfuriating\u201d to almost everyone."

    "summary": "From reducing NIH funding to slashing USAID to new tariffs, Republican lawmakers are beginning to speak out \u2014 carefully \u2014 against some of Trump's actions.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans on Capitol Hill are full of praise for President Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive actions and attempts to slash some federal spending, selling it as the kind of disruption that Americans voted for last fall.",
      "That is, until the pain risks hitting home for their constituents.",
      "From cuts to health and agriculture funding to fears of new tariffs negatively impacting local industries and consumers, Republican lawmakers are starting to push back against certain aspects of Trump's plans. And they are doing so carefully, acknowledging that voters want to shake up business-as-usual in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and wanting to avoid Trump\u2019s ire.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., recently pushed back on the administration\u2019s funding reductions under the National Institutes of Health. The University of Alabama is a major recipient of that money, which has helped make it the state\u2019s largest employer.",
      "Britt told AL.com that \u201ca smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.\u201d",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the cap on indirect costs under NIH grants was \u201cpoorly conceived\u201d and would impose \u201carbitrary cuts in funding for vital research at our Maine institutions.\u201d",
      "And Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., warned that universities that lack \u201cbig endowments\u201d would lose out the most due to the NIH cuts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be very difficult for them to conduct this research. And so, of course, I want people in Louisiana to benefit from research dollars, and for it to not all go to Massachusetts and California,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cSo I am in active conversation with my folks back home, and am researching the issue.\u201d",
      "While the NIH funding reductions triggered a round of warnings, they were among several examples of Republicans growing queasy about some of the blunt steps that Trump\u2019s administration is taking that they believe could lead to adverse consequences for their states.",
      "The dynamic points to an upcoming challenge for Trump, as GOP lawmakers represent his most important line of defense to issue controversial orders. If he goes too far for a critical mass of them, they could use their legislative powers to stop him, teaming up with Democrats if they need to.",
      "Protecting parochial interests is among the oldest traditions on Capitol Hill, but it is an elevated imperative for Republicans in red states that are disproportionately dependent on Washington for money.",
      "Among the top 20 states that take more money from the federal government than they sent in tax payments, 13 are solidly red states that voted for Trump in the last three elections, according to an analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government into the fiscal 2024 budget. Meanwhile, the top five states (and nine of the top 10) that send more money to the Treasury Department than they receive voted for Democrats in the last three presidential elections.",
      "Another imperative for Republicans in rural areas is to protect farmers, who rely on the federal government as a major customer. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have targeted for dismantling,  administers the Food for Peace program, where the government buys and distributes American crops to help fight hunger around the world.",
      "A coalition of Republicans in rural states and districts, including House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., introduced legislation this week to save the Food for Peace program by transferring it to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\u201cFor 70 years, Kansas and American farmers have played an active role in sending their commodities to feed malnourished and starving populations around the world. This free gift from the American people is more than food. It\u2019s diplomacy and feeds the most vulnerable communities,\u201d Rep. Tracey Mann, R-Kan., said in a statement.",
      "Mann, whose office said the program has \u201cfed more than 4 billion people in more than 150 countries,\u201d introduced the bill with Thompson and Reps. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., David Rouzer, R-N.C., as well as Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and John Hoeven, R-N.D.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs have also ruffled feathers among some of his otherwise solid allies on Capitol Hill. That includes Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa \u2014 the Senate president pro tempore and chair of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 who protested when Trump threatened to levy tariffs on imports from Canada.",
      "Grassley, citing \u201cBiden inflation,\u201d noted the high cost of fertilizer and asked for an exemption that protects Iowa farmers.",
      "\u201cI plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a free and fair trader,\u201d Grassley told NBC News. \u201cAnd the president was elected on a proposition of trying tariffs out. If they\u2019re for negotiation, we\u2019ll see if they work. If they work, I\u2019ll applaud him. If they don\u2019t work, I\u2019ll tell you I told you so.\u201d",
      "Kentucky\u2019s two Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, have also objected to Trump\u2019s tariffs, warning that they\u2019ll drive up costs for Americans \u2014 including Kentuckians.",
      "In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Louisville Courier-Journal, McConnell warned that slapping tariffs could have negative consequences for \u201cour state\u2019s 75,000 family farms that sell their crops around the globe, or the hardworking Kentuckians who craft 95% of the world\u2019s bourbon, or our auto industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn Kentucky, local storeowners are already hearing about their suppliers\u2019 prices going up. One estimate suggests the president\u2019s tariffs could cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 each year,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about rising prices here at home. During the last Trump administration, retaliatory tariffs from trade partners set off a broader trade war that hit wide swaths of American industry, from agriculture to manufacturing to aerospace and motor vehicles to distilled spirits. Already, Canada announced retaliatory measures that take direct aim at Kentucky production, targeting products like peanut butter and whiskey.\u201d",
      "Paul, who often disagrees with McConnell, found common ground with him on that issue.",
      "\u201cWe won the last election by complaining about Democrats\u2019 policies, which gave us high prices. Tariff lovers will be forced to explain the persistence of high prices,\u201d Paul said on X.",
      "There may be more tension on the horizon between Trump and Republicans in Congress, as the president has frozen grant funding under two laws enacted by President Joe Biden, for infrastructure money and clean energy credits like on electric vehicles. Both of those laws have delivered significant money to red states.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee that oversees government funding, said Trump should go about his attempts to slash or freeze money in a different way: by winning congressional approval first.",
      "\u201cRunning farmers out of business, derailing infrastructure projects, cutting cancer research and killing good-paying clean energy jobs isn\u2019t just unpopular, it\u2019s devastating for working people everywhere \u2014 and it is time Trump reverses his illegal funding freeze and DOGE cuts in their entirety,\u201d Murray told NBC News.\u00a0\u201cTrump\u2019s policies are hurting communities and families in red states and blue states. If Trump and Elon want to cut funding for cancer research and infrastructure projects, they need to send us a proposal and try and win the votes in Congress to do it.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 02:17:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Blocking reporters from covering news events at the Oval Office.",
    "story": [
      "Blocking reporters from covering news events at the Oval Office. Ousting journalists from their working spaces in the Pentagon. Investigating public media companies that are often the targets of conservative attacks.",
      "In the three weeks since he returned to the White House, President Donald Trump and his administration have moved beyond his usual anti-news media rhetoric to take a variety of actions that have limited some outlets\u2019 access while hitting others with lawsuits and directives that critics say are naked attempts to bend news coverage to his will.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump himself has a \u2018game plan\u2019 per se, but it is clear that the overall picture is of an Administration that disdains a free press,\u201d Rebecca Hamilton, a law professor at American University, said in an email. \u201cTheir view \u2014 and this is evident from Trump\u2019s rhetoric, his prior lawsuits, the Pentagon office space memo, and the FCC investigations \u2014 is that any media outlets that don\u2019t align themselves with Trump\u2019s agenda are the enemy. This reflects a fundamental disrespect for the principles underlying a democratic commitment to a free press.\u201d",
      "In what may be the most glaring example of that, Associated Press reporters were blocked from covering Trump at White House events for two days in a row after the AP continued to refer to the body of water just south of the United States as the Gulf of Mexico instead of the Gulf of America, the new name Trump gave it in one of many executive orders he has signed since he took office. The AP Stylebook, which many news outlets use, including NBC News, published an update two days after Trump renamed the gulf on Jan. 21 that said the AP will continue calling it the Gulf of Mexico \u201cwhile acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.\u201d",
      "\u201cPunishing journalists for not adopting state-mandated terminology is an alarming attack on press freedom,\u201d the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit group that advocates for First Amendment rights, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump has the authority to change how the U.S. government refers to the Gulf. But he cannot punish a news organization for using another term. The role of our free press is to hold those in power accountable, not to act as their mouthpiece.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, was unapologetic Wednesday, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to cover the White House.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America, and I\u2019m not sure why news outlets don\u2019t want to call it that,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "The White House didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment.",
      "The AP battle is only the most recent in a series of actions that Trump and his administration have taken, a significant escalation even beyond his first term, when he mostly kept to verbal barbs \u2014 though he did ban CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta from the White House in 2018.",
      "This time, Trump has been using the full power \u2014 and pushing the limits \u2014 of the presidency, installing some administrators who appear keen to act on his behalf.",
      "Most active has been Brendan Carr, the newly installed Federal Communications Commission chair, who has wasted no time launching investigations against many of the media companies Trump often criticizes.",
      "Carr has launched investigations into NPR and PBS \u2014 two media companies often targeted with conservative rhetoric over perceived liberal bias and their government funding \u2014 over on-air recognition of financial sponsors and into a San Francisco radio station over its broadcast of the live locations of federal immigration agents. The FCC has also reopened a probe of CBS for \u201cnews distortion,\u201d which are rules around the \u201cintentional falsification of the news\u201d that it has rarely tapped in the past, and it reopened a probe of ABC over how it handled a debate between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "Carr has also opened an inquiry into Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, over its promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "\u201cThe FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act ... including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\u201d Carr said in a letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, according to Reuters.",
      "A Comcast spokesperson said in an email: \u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d",
      "Trump has long demonized DEI programs, most recently implying they were somehow responsible for the deadly collision of a commercial airliner and a military helicopter last month over the Potomac River.",
      "Experts said pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the FCC investigating a media outlet for its DEI programs is certainly in line with President Trump\u2019s orders\u201d cracking down on DEI within the federal government, said Daxton \u201cChip\u201d Stewart, a journalism professor at Texas Christian University. \u201cI do think it\u2019s extremely concerning. But Mr. Carr seems eager to launch investigations into any media that is not appropriately deferential to President Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump has in the past threatened to revoke broadcast licenses, which the FCC doles out (it decides which local TV stations can broadcast but doesn\u2019t license the major networks themselves).",
      "While the government doesn\u2019t license national networks, it does license local TV and radio stations that use public airwaves (which include NBC affiliates). And even the threat of action by the FCC could make reporters who don\u2019t have the resources to fight back pull their punches, experts said.",
      "\u201cAlso important to recognize here is that whether or not any broadcaster is stripped over their license, or any reporter is sued, the mere threat of such action, backed by the power of the State, impinges on the ability of the press to report freely, and risks the emergence of self-censorship,\u201d Hamilton wrote.",
      "Media watchdogs and other journalists have already accused some of the country\u2019s most respected news outlets of bending to Trump\u2019s will.",
      "Before the election, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times were harshly criticized for shelving their planned endorsements of Harris for president.",
      "After the election, ABC agreed to pay $15 million as part of a legal settlement with Trump and put to bed a dispute that centered on an interview in which, Trump alleged, anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him. Trump has also sued CBS in a personal capacity over its airing of an interview with Harris on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which Trump claimed was deceptively edited. CBS denied the allegation.",
      "Meanwhile, CBS, under pressure from Carr and the FCC, disclosed the transcript of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.",
      "On Jan. 31, the Defense Department announced that it was instituting a new \u201cannual media rotation program\u201d and dislodged several news outlets, including NBC News, from their Pentagon office spaces.",
      "Taking their spots were three conservative news organizations and a progressive news outfit that doesn\u2019t even have a Pentagon correspondent.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that President Trump has an intimate understanding of the significance of the relationship between the media and the public,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThat is why he is consistently shrinking the access of outlets whose reporting he doesn\u2019t like and expanding the space for outlets with coverage he does like.\u201d"

    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The GOP-controlled Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to be President Donald Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, putting the former congresswoman in charge of the sprawling U.S. intelligence community.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The GOP-controlled Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Tulsi Gabbard to be President Donald Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, putting the former congresswoman in charge of the sprawling U.S. intelligence community.",
      "The 52-48 vote was largely along party lines, with nearly all Republicans present voting in favor of Gabbard. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the former longtime GOP leader who has clashed with Trump, was the only Republican who joined all Democrats in voting against her.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s confirmation is a win for Trump and represents yet another example of his dominance over the GOP, where few have shown a willingness to step out of line.",
      "After Trump announced Gabbard as his DNI pick in November, Democrats \u2014 and a handful of Republicans \u2014 voiced serious concerns about her 2017 secret meeting with then-President Bashar Assad of Syria; her sympathetic comments about Russia; her past efforts to repeal a powerful government surveillance tool, known as Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\u2019s Section 702; and her previous support for Edward Snowden, a former government contractor who leaked classified information to the press about those spying programs.",
      "Before her nomination, Gabbard had argued that Snowden should be pardoned. But appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee at a confirmation hearing last month, Gabbard reversed course, saying she would not push for Snowden to be pardoned or receive clemency, even as she refused to call the former National Security Agency contractor a \u201ctraitor\u201d when pressed by GOP senators.",
      "In addition, Gabbard backed off her sharp criticism of Section 702 during the hearing, calling it a \u201ccrucial\u201d tool after Congress passed new protections last year.",
      "In the end, McConnell was the sole Republican to buck Trump and vote no on Gabbard. In a scathing, lengthy statement after the vote, McConnell said it was apparent Gabbard was not prepared for the job and demonstrated a \"history of alarming lapses in judgment.\"",
      "\u201cThe Senate\u2019s power of advice and consent is not an option; it is an obligation, and one we cannot pretend to misunderstand. When a nominee\u2019s record proves them unworthy of the highest public trust, and when their command of relevant policy falls short of the requirements of their office, the Senate should withhold its consent,\" McConnell said, specifically sounding the alarm about Gabbard's remarks about Snowden, Chinese aggression and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\"In my assessment, Tulsi Gabbard failed to demonstrate that she is prepared to assume this tremendous national trust.\"",
      "Moderate Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the Intelligence Committee and a key GOP swing vote, was one of the Republicans who had raised concerns about Gabbard but threw her support behind her just days after her confirmation hearing. Collins helped write the 2004 legislation that established the DNI position.",
      "\u201cThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2026 has become far larger than it was designed to be, and Ms. Gabbard shares my vision of returning the agency to its intended size,\u201d Collins said in a statement this month. \u201cIn response to my questions during our discussion in my office and at the open hearing, as well as through her explanation at the closed hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Ms. Gabbard addressed my concerns regarding her views on Edward Snowden.\u201d",
      "Democrats were sharply critical of Gabbard, suggesting Republicans were more concerned about not angering Trump than national security.",
      "\u201cInstead of speaking fact and truth, Ms. Gabbard repeatedly speaks the language of falsities and conspiracy theories,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor Tuesday. \u201cThe director of national intelligence must be strong against America\u2019s adversaries. But Ms. Gabbard has spent her entire career sympathizing with the likes of Vladimir Putin and Bashar Al Assad.\u201d",
      "The director of national intelligence oversees the 18 agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community, including the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. The DNI also advises the president on intelligence matters.",
      "Gabbard, 43, an Iraq war veteran, has served for more than two decades in the Army Reserve. She had been a longtime Hawaii Democrat, serving in the state House and on the Honolulu City Council. She went on to represent Hawaii in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. After she unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Gabbard endorsed Joe Biden over Trump.",
      "But she soured on the Biden administration and left the Democratic Party in 2022. Last October, Gabbard announced she was joining the Republican Party and endorsed Trump, appearing with him on the campaign trail in the run-up to the 2024 election.",
      "Senate votes to advance RFK Jr.'s health secretary bid",
      "The Senate also voted along party lines Wednesday to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump\u2019s unorthodox pick for health and human services secretary. The 53-47 vote puts Kennedy on a path to be confirmed by Thursday morning.",
      "Some Republicans have expressed skepticism about Kennedy given his past opposition to vaccines and support for abortion. But during a shaky performance at his confirmation hearing last month, Kennedy said he now believes \"vaccines have a critical role in health care.\" Asked about his position on abortion, he replied: \u201cI agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy,\" adding that abortion laws should be left to the states.",
      "Last week, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a physician and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee who was seen a crucial swing vote, announced his support for RFK Jr. after saying he extracted a half dozen key concessions from the nominee.",
      "In Cassidy's words, RFK\u00a0and the Trump administration committed to \u201cprotect the public health benefit of vaccination.\u201d RFK also committed to having a \"close collaborative working relationship\u201d with\u00a0Cassidy, the senator said, where they will speak multiple times a month.\u00a0RFK\u00a0will also appear before the HELP committee on a quarterly basis if needed, Cassidy said."

      "The app later posted a video that appeared to show Duo getting \u201ckilled\u201d by a Tesla Cybertruck.",
      "The owl first became a meme in early 2019 with \u201cEvil Duolingo Owl\u201d appearing in posts across social media. But it wasn\u2019t until 2021 that the owl rose to fame on TikTok, where Duolingo posted lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek videos featuring a life-size version of the mascot.",
      "Fake or not, Duo\u2019s death announcement has inspired other brands and organizations to get in on the bit by mourning the character on social media.",
      "\u201c#RIPDuo.

      "Before his \u201cdeath,\u201d Duo caused a bit of a stir online when he weighed in on the Super Bowl halftime show. The mascot appeared to poke fun at Canadian rapper Drake, whom performer Kendrick Lamar refers to in the diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d Some online suggested the mascot was \u201cfaking\u201d its death to dodge any lawsuits from Drake.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 21:03:50 GMT",
    "summary": "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed by a hippo during an African safari has filed a lawsuit alleging that their tour operator was negligent in failing to keep her safe.",
    "story": [
      "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed by a hippo during an African safari has filed a lawsuit alleging that their tour operator was negligent in failing to keep her safe.",
      "Craig Manders says in the suit that he witnessed the horrifying death of his wife Lisa, 70, who was killed in Zambia last year during a safari organized by a Connecticut company, African Portfolio.",
      "\u201cHad we understood the dangers posed by the hippopotamus, we never would have agreed to be in such close contact while on foot,\u201d Manders said in a statement released by his attorneys, Paul Slager and Nicole Coates.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we were unwittingly exposed to such an extreme danger, a danger made even worse by our tour guides leaving Lisa alone on foot with nothing between her and such a deadly animal, is nothing short of astonishing.\u201d",
      "Rod Gould, a lawyer for African Portfolio, described the incident as a terrible but \"really unusual\" tragedy. He said the company arranges tours and works with the most reputable safari lodges in Africa but is not responsible for what goes on during the trips.",
      "\"My client is a tour operator. It organizes tours,\" Gould said. \"A trip, for example, might include airfare. We're not responsible if the airline loses luggage.\"",
      "In the suit filed in Stamford Superior Court, Manders says he and his wife left the U.S. on May 31, 2024, for a 10-day safari in Zambia, a country in southern Africa.",
      "Five days later, the couple went on a \u201cbush walk\u201d with guides who led them to a riverbank where a lone hippopotamus was resting in the water, the suit says. Known for being fiercely territorial and aggressive, hippos are among the most dangerous animals on Earth.",
      "Despite their size \u2013 adult males typically weigh over 3,000 pounds \u2013 hippos can run fast over short distances, reaching speeds upward of 20 mph.",
      "The guides \u201cknew or should have known that the close presence of the wild hippopotamus to participants in the Bush Walk posed an immediate and extreme danger, due to the known tendencies of hippopotami to be highly unpredictable, territorial, and aggressive in such circumstances,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "But the guides, including at least one armed with a rifle, left the area, the suit says, leaving the Manders and others in their group to observe the hippo without any protection.",
      "Then, without warning, the hippo lifted its head and charged out of the water toward Lisa Manders, according to the lawsuit. The massive animal caught up with Manders and attacked her, the suit says.",
      "\u201cAlthough Lisa Manders attempted to flee, she was unable to escape and the hippopotamus violently attacked her, grabbing her by its mouth, lifting her off the ground, shaking her entire body, and crushing her head and body with its bite,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Lisa Manders suffered \u201ccatastrophic injuries\u201d and died shortly after, according to the lawsuit, which noted that her husband witnessed the attack.",
      "A mother of three from Cranford, Manders worked in the financial industry for more than 40 years. \u201cLisa was the best mother and wife anyone could ever hope for,\u201d her husband said. \u201cHer violent death is a devastating loss not only for our family, but for our community.\"",
      "The lawsuit does not identify where in Zambia the attack occurred, but the country\u2019s minister of tourism was quoted in a local news report lamenting the death of an American tourist killed by a hippo at the Lower Zambezi National Park on June 5, 2024.",
      "The government\u2019s \u201cthoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the deceased, even as investigations continue on the incident,\u201d the tourism minister, Rodney Sikumba, said in a statement, according to Radio Christian Voice.",
      "Craig Manders\u2019 attorneys described the incident as an awful tragedy that was \u201centirely preventable.\u201d",
      "\u201cInteracting with the natural world in the wilderness can be an incredibly rich experience,\u201d said Slager, of Slager Madry LLC. \u201cBut wilderness guides and tour operators like African Portfolio carry the responsibility to ensure basic safety precautions are taken to ensure customers visiting the African wilderness are not unnecessarily exposed to extreme dangers.\u201d"

      "The voyage was nearly two hours old when the vessel lost contact with its support ship, setting off a frantic search.",
      "Public fascination about the submersible was sparked by reports of \u201cbanging noises\u201d\u00a0that had been detected, sparking talk about how long passengers could sustain themselves in a cramped tube running out of oxygen."

    "story": [
      "Officials in Sangamon County, Illinois, have agreed to a $10 million settlement with the family of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who was shot and killed in her home last summer after she called police for assistance.",
      "The agreement reached last week between lawyers for Massey\u2019s family and attorneys representing the county was unanimously approved Tuesday evening by the Sangamon County Board.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Massey\u2019s family, held a virtual news conference Wednesday on what would have been her 37th birthday.",
      "Crump said it \u201cis only the first step in the journey for justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want civil accountability, criminal culpability and we want legislative changes,\u201d Crump said. \u201cWe want the laws to prevent something like this from happening again.\u201d",
      "He and Antonio Romanucci, another family attorney, called the settlement \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that this, by far, is the largest settlement reached in Sangamon County of any kind, let alone a civil rights case such as this one,\u201d Romanucci said.",
      "He pushed back against criticism that the amount was too low, saying it came to 50% of the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s annual budget.",
      "\u201cThis settlement is magnanimous, and it\u2019s very relevant, and it\u2019s very significant, because, as Ben knows, we\u2019re not in Minneapolis, we\u2019re not in Memphis, we\u2019re not in Louisville,\u201d he said, referring to other cities where he and Crump have negotiated or are negotiating settlements for the families of Black people killed by police. \u201cWe\u2019re in Sangamon County.\u201d",
      "The county administrator, Brian McFadden, said at the meeting Tuesday that it is the largest settlement in his memory. County officials have said the $10 million would be paid from a settlement fund and reserves from other county funds.",
      "Romanucci said the money would go to Massey\u2019s two children, adding that a court will decide compensation for attorneys.",
      "Massey called 911 early on the morning of July 6 to report a suspected prowler outside her home. Then-Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Sean Grayson and another deputy, who has not been identified, responded, according to body-camera footage.",
      "Grayson, who is white, pointed out a pot of boiling water on the stove, and as Massey retrieved it and was handling the pot, she twice said, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson yelled at her to drop the pot, and as she ducked, he fired three shots at her, one of which struck her beneath her left eye.",
      "Grayson said in a report written three days after the shooting that he feared \u201cgreat bodily harm\u201d or death because Massey\u00a0said, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d",
      "Prior to the shooting, Grayson had worked for six law enforcement agencies in central Illinois in four years. Nearly two weeks after Massey\u2019s killing, he was\u00a0fired and charged\u00a0with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct. He has pleaded not guilty and remains in jail.",
      "His attorney declined to comment on Wednesday.",
      "Sonya Massey\u2019s father, James Wilburn, said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference that Sangamon County and some of the other agencies where Grayson worked were responsible for his daughter\u2019s death.",
      "Records obtained by NBC News indicate documented issues with Grayson\u2019s performance at some of his previous employers.",
      "\u201cI think he should have never been hired,\u201d Wilburn said.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The day before the shooting, Massey\u2019s mother, Donna Massey, had called 911 seeking help for her daughter, who she was concerned the police might try to hurt, Donna Massey told a dispatcher in recordings released by the sheriff\u2019s department.",
      "After her killing, Massey\u2019s name joined a growing list of Black residents fatally shot in their homes by police across the country, including\u00a0Botham Jean\u00a0in 2018,\u00a0Atatiana Jefferson\u00a0in 2019 and\u00a0Air Force Senior Airman Roger Fortson\u00a0last year.",
      "Massey\u2019s fatal shooting also forced the premature retirement of Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell, who hired Grayson, after residents and Gov. JB Pritzker called on him to step down.",
      "Pritzker said at the time that Campbell had failed at his job because he hired Grayson despite documented issues with Grayson\u2019s performance at previous agencies.",
      "Grayson\u2019s employment history, and two DUIs convictions, in 2015 and 2016, led Massey\u2019s family and others to question why he was allowed to work in law enforcement. The 2015 conviction led to his premature discharge from the Army the following year.",
      "The Massey case prompted a memorandum of agreement\u00a0between the U.S. Justice Department and the sheriff\u2019s office, in which the county pledged a series of changes, including more training, updates to policies pertaining to\u00a0nondiscriminatory policing and the reporting of use-of-force data.",
      "The DOJ found no discriminatory practices by the sheriff\u2019s office or the county\u2019s emergency dispatch operation in connection with Massey\u2019s death."

      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",

      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners.

      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday threatened to withdraw from his country's ceasefire with Hamas and resume \u201cintense fighting\u201d in the Gaza Strip if the militant group does not release more hostages by midday Saturday.",
      "Netanyahu's warning followed President Donald Trump's threat in recent days to let \u201call hell break out\u201d in Gaza, after Hamas reiterated Tuesday that it would indefinitely postpone the next round of hostage-prisoner swap scheduled for Saturday. The Palestinian organization has accused Israel of violating terms of their three-week-old ceasefire.",
      "After a four-hour emergency meeting with Israel's security Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu said he had received unanimous support to mass Israeli troops in and around Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon \u2014 the ceasefire will end and the [Israel Defense Forces] will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,\u201d he said in a video statement following the meeting.",
      "It was unclear whether Netanyahu was referring to the three hostages originally scheduled to be released Saturday or all hostages held in Gaza.",
      "While Hamas earlier this week said it planned to delay hostage releases \u2014 it has accused Israel of carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza \u2014 it has since reaffirmed its commitment to the truce without explicitly reversing it position on freeing Israeli captives.",
      "Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told NBC News in an interview Tuesday that the militant group is committed to the ceasefire deal, to which \u201cit adheres fully and not selectively as the Israeli side does.\u201d",
      "Responding to Trump\u2019s earlier threat, Qassem added that Gaza was already \u201cliving in a state of hell.\u201d",

      "Nearly 16 months of war in the Gaza Strip were put on pause after a fragile, three-phase ceasefire deal came into effect Jan. 19.",
      "Under the first phase, due to last 42 days, Hamas has incrementally released 16 of 33 hostages, as well as separately releasing five Thai hostages.",
      "So far, 76 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, with more than 35 of them believed to be dead. Most of those still held in Gaza were among the 250 people kidnapped during the Hamas-led terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials.",
      "Since Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza began, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, with the majority of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population forcibly displaced, according to local officials.",
      "In Netanyahu's statement late Tuesday, his rhetoric echoed that of Trump, who on Monday demanded that Hamas free all remaining hostages \"by Saturday at 12 o\u2019clock.\" The president did not specify whether he meant midnight or midday.",
      "Trump doubled down on his position Tuesday following a meeting at the White House with Jordan's King Abdullah, reiterating his belief that Jordan and Egypt should take in Palestinians displaced from Gaza.",
      "The Jordanian king reiterated his \"steadfast opposition\" to Trump's plan although he also said that Jordan could take in 2,000 Palestinian children from Gaza with cancer or other serious illnesses.",
      "Last week, Trump suggested that the 2.3 million residents of Gaza should leave the enclave so that the United States could take over and develop the territory into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0on Tuesday said the security Cabinet had endorsed Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "This week's rising tensions suggest the ceasefire deal may be \u201capproaching a breaking point,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow on the Middle East at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said Wednesday.",
      "Mekelberg told NBC News that Trump\u2019s comments make an already fragile situation more unpredictable.",
      "\"He sends the message that he wants to be the man for peace and every act that he is doing points to exactly the opposite direction,\" he said, adding that the Israeli government should end \"all this pandering to President Trump\" at the risk of being \"complicit in war crimes and probably destabilizing the Middle East.\"",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t be very surprised if it breaks even before we get to the end of the first phase,\u201d he said, referring to the planned end of the ceasefire's initial stage slated for March 2.",
      "While Trump's suggested plan has received broad-based support across Israel's political right wing, the families of hostages being held by Hamas also expressed their distress over the prospect of a breakdown in the ceasefire.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing the families of Israeli hostages, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cwe must not go backward. We cannot allow the hostages to waste away in captivity.\u201d",

According to Reuters, he added that \u201cif the situation explodes militarily once more, all this effort will be wasted.\u201d",
      "Gheit also said the regional organization planned to reintroduce the Arab Peace Initiative, which was floated in 2002 to normalize ties with Israel in exchange for a statehood deal with Palestinians.",

      "It also said more resources including training and security are needed to help reintegrate children into society.",
      "\u201cThe international community cannot continue to make empty promises,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe country needs immediate and sustained technical and financial assistance to rescue a generation of boys and girls from being lost to repeated cycles of gang violence.\u201d",
      "In 2023, 128 children were reported killed, according to the U.N. While the figure wasn\u2019t available for last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed in 2024, the organization found.",

      "Trump has suggested several times that the United States should buy Greenland, the largest island in the world, which sits between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean and is technically part of North America. It has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century, but it became a self-governing territory in 1979.",

      "While there has been a popular and long-standing movement calling for independence from Denmark in Greenland, most of the island\u2019s 56,000 inhabitants \u2014 the majority from Inuit tribes \u2014 appear to agree that it is not for sale.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 About 75,000 federal employees have accepted the White House's \"deferred resignation\" offer to resign but be paid through September, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The offer's deadline closed Wednesday after a federal judge ruled to end a temporary pause to the program.",
      "NBC News cannot independently verify the number of employees who took the White House's offer.",
      "The number of federal employees who are reported to have taken the offer amounts to less than 5% of the federal workforce. The administration had set a higher expectation, hoping that 5% to 10% of the federal workforce would accept its offer. The number of employees who accepted the offer was first reported by Semafor.",
      "In fiscal year 2023, the attrition rate of the federal workforce was 5.9%, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that promotes government service.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, U.S. District Judge George A. O\u2019Toole Jr. allowed the resignation offer to proceed after having previously issued an order to temporarily halt it. O'Toole\u00a0said in his ruling Wednesday that the unions that sued to stop the offer did not have the necessary legal standing to bring the case.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 A former police officer was found guilty Wednesday of\u00a0voluntary manslaughter\u00a0in the fatal shooting of a Black man during a 2022 confrontation at a New Mexico gas station.",
      "Las Cruces police Officer Brad Lunsford\u2019s verdict in a jury trial is the latest outcome in cases that prosecutors have linked to systematic brutality against Black people by members of law enforcement, nearly five years after the\u00a0May 2020 killing\u00a0of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.",
      "Lunsford, who is white, had pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Jose Coronado, said he will ask the judge to review the verdict for its legal sufficiency.",
      "\u201cWhile I respect the jury\u2019s verdict, I am extremely disappointed in it. I don\u2019t believe the state met its burden,\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Prosecutors said he shot Presley Eze at point-blank range in a scuffle after police responded to a 911 call from a gas station attendant who reported that Eze stole beer. Eze allegedly placed his hand on a second officer\u2019s stun gun before being shot.",
      "Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said the use of deadly force was not reasonable, noting that Lunsford immediately drew his service weapon and shot Eze in the back of the head.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict reaffirms a fundamental principle: no one is above the law \u2014 not even those sworn to uphold it. Officer Lunsford\u2019s actions were not just a tragic lapse in judgment; they were an egregious abuse of power that cost Presley Eze his life,\u201d Torrez said in a statement after the verdict was announced.",
      "The charge of voluntary manslaughter with a firearms enhancement carries a possible sentence of up to nine years in prison. Evidence at trial included police body camera video of the confrontation, in which police pulled Eze from a vehicle and the struggle ensued.",
      "Philip Stinson, a professor of criminal justice at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, said most fatal shootings by on-duty officers are determined to be legally justified under precedent stemming from two 1980s-era U.S. Supreme Court rulings.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly difficult for a prosecutor to obtain a conviction in a jury trial in one of these cases, and that\u2019s because jurors are very reluctant to second guess the split-second, often life-or-death decisions of an on-duty police officer in a potentially violent street encounter,\u201d Stinson said. \u201cAnything can happen, but it\u2019s only in the most egregious cases.\u201d",
      "Records compiled by Stinson, university colleagues and students through the Police Integrity Research Group show that 205 nonfederal law enforcement officers have been arrested on criminal charges of homicide or manslaughter over the past 20 years, resulting in 66 convictions, 27 of them for manslaughter or homicide.",
      "\u201cIf you do get a conviction, it\u2019s often for the lesser offense,\u201d Stinson said.",
      "More than 900 fatal shootings by on-duty state and local law enforcement officers typically take place each year in the U.S., he said",
      "In pursuing a criminal charge against Lunsford, Torrez described the killing of Eze as a tragedy and \u201cyet another example of poor police tactics resulting in an unjustifiable use of force to subdue an individual resisting arrest for the commission of a minor crime.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Blocking reporters from covering news events at the Oval Office. Ousting journalists from their working spaces in the Pentagon. Investigating public media companies that are often the targets of conservative attacks.",
      "In the three weeks since he returned to the White House, President Donald Trump and his administration have moved beyond his usual anti-news media rhetoric to take a variety of actions that have limited some outlets\u2019 access while hitting others with lawsuits and directives that critics say are naked attempts to bend news coverage to his will.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if Trump himself has a \u2018game plan\u2019 per se, but it is clear that the overall picture is of an Administration that disdains a free press,\u201d Rebecca Hamilton, a law professor at American University, said in an email. \u201cTheir view \u2014 and this is evident from Trump\u2019s rhetoric, his prior lawsuits, the Pentagon office space memo, and the FCC investigations \u2014 is that any media outlets that don\u2019t align themselves with Trump\u2019s agenda are the enemy. This reflects a fundamental disrespect for the principles underlying a democratic commitment to a free press.\u201d",
      "In what may be the most glaring example of that, Associated Press reporters were blocked from covering Trump at White House events for two days in a row after the AP continued to refer to the body of water just south of the United States as the Gulf of Mexico instead of the Gulf of America, the new name Trump gave it in one of many executive orders he has signed since he took office. The AP Stylebook, which many news outlets use, including NBC News, published an update two days after Trump renamed the gulf on Jan. 21 that said the AP will continue calling it the Gulf of Mexico \u201cwhile acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.\u201d",
      "\u201cPunishing journalists for not adopting state-mandated terminology is an alarming attack on press freedom,\u201d the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit group that advocates for First Amendment rights, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump has the authority to change how the U.S. government refers to the Gulf. But he cannot punish a news organization for using another term. The role of our free press is to hold those in power accountable, not to act as their mouthpiece.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, was unapologetic Wednesday, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to cover the White House.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America, and I\u2019m not sure why news outlets don\u2019t want to call it that,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "The White House didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment.",
      "The AP battle is only the most recent in a series of actions that Trump and his administration have taken, a significant escalation even beyond his first term, when he mostly kept to verbal barbs \u2014 though he did ban CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta from the White House in 2018.",
      "This time, Trump has been using the full power \u2014 and pushing the limits \u2014 of the presidency, installing some administrators who appear keen to act on his behalf.",
      "Most active has been Brendan Carr, the newly installed Federal Communications Commission chair, who has wasted no time launching investigations against many of the media companies Trump often criticizes.",
      "Carr has launched investigations into NPR and PBS \u2014 two media companies often targeted with conservative rhetoric over perceived liberal bias and their government funding \u2014 over on-air recognition of financial sponsors and into a San Francisco radio station over its broadcast of the live locations of federal immigration agents. The FCC has also reopened a probe of CBS for \u201cnews distortion,\u201d which are rules around the \u201cintentional falsification of the news\u201d that it has rarely tapped in the past, and it reopened a probe of ABC over how it handled a debate between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "Carr has also opened an inquiry into Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, over its promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "\u201cThe FCC will be taking fresh action to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act ... including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination,\u201d Carr said in a letter to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, according to Reuters.",
      "A Comcast spokesperson said in an email: \u201cWe have received an inquiry from the Federal Communications Commission and will be cooperating with the FCC to answer their questions. For decades, our company has been built on a foundation of integrity and respect for all of our employees and customers.\u201d",
      "Trump has long demonized DEI programs, most recently implying they were somehow responsible for the deadly collision of a commercial airliner and a military helicopter last month over the Potomac River.",
      "Experts said pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the FCC investigating a media outlet for its DEI programs is certainly in line with President Trump\u2019s orders\u201d cracking down on DEI within the federal government, said Daxton \u201cChip\u201d Stewart, a journalism professor at Texas Christian University. \u201cI do think it\u2019s extremely concerning. But Mr. Carr seems eager to launch investigations into any media that is not appropriately deferential to President Trump.\u201d",
      "Trump has in the past threatened to revoke broadcast licenses, which the FCC doles out (it decides which local TV stations can broadcast but doesn\u2019t license the major networks themselves).",
      "While the government doesn\u2019t license national networks, it does license local TV and radio stations that use public airwaves (which include NBC affiliates). And even the threat of action by the FCC could make reporters who don\u2019t have the resources to fight back pull their punches, experts said.",
      "\u201cAlso important to recognize here is that whether or not any broadcaster is stripped over their license, or any reporter is sued, the mere threat of such action, backed by the power of the State, impinges on the ability of the press to report freely, and risks the emergence of self-censorship,\u201d Hamilton wrote.",
      "Media watchdogs and other journalists have already accused some of the country\u2019s most respected news outlets of bending to Trump\u2019s will.",
      "Before the election, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times were harshly criticized for shelving their planned endorsements of Harris for president.",
      "After the election, ABC agreed to pay $15 million as part of a legal settlement with Trump and put to bed a dispute that centered on an interview in which, Trump alleged, anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him. Trump has also sued CBS in a personal capacity over its airing of an interview with Harris on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which Trump claimed was deceptively edited. CBS denied the allegation.",
      "Meanwhile, CBS, under pressure from Carr and the FCC, disclosed the transcript of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.",
      "On Jan. 31, the Defense Department announced that it was instituting a new \u201cannual media rotation program\u201d and dislodged several news outlets, including NBC News, from their Pentagon office spaces.",
      "Taking their spots were three conservative news organizations and a progressive news outfit that doesn\u2019t even have a Pentagon correspondent.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that President Trump has an intimate understanding of the significance of the relationship between the media and the public,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cThat is why he is consistently shrinking the access of outlets whose reporting he doesn\u2019t like and expanding the space for outlets with coverage he does like.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans on Capitol Hill are full of praise for President Donald Trump\u2019s flurry of executive actions and attempts to slash some federal spending, selling it as the kind of disruption that Americans voted for last fall.",
      "That is, until the pain risks hitting home for their constituents.",
      "From cuts to health and agriculture funding to fears of new tariffs negatively impacting local industries and consumers, Republican lawmakers are starting to push back against certain aspects of Trump's plans. And they are doing so carefully, acknowledging that voters want to shake up business-as-usual in the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and wanting to avoid Trump\u2019s ire.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., recently pushed back on the administration\u2019s funding reductions under the National Institutes of Health. The University of Alabama is a major recipient of that money, which has helped make it the state\u2019s largest employer.",
      "Britt told AL.com that \u201ca smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.\u201d",

      "And Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., warned that universities that lack \u201cbig endowments\u201d would lose out the most due to the NIH cuts.",

      "While the NIH funding reductions triggered a round of warnings, they were among several examples of Republicans growing queasy about some of the blunt steps that Trump\u2019s administration is taking that they believe could lead to adverse consequences for their states.",
      "The dynamic points to an upcoming challenge for Trump, as GOP lawmakers represent his most important line of defense to issue controversial orders. If he goes too far for a critical mass of them, they could use their legislative powers to stop him, teaming up with Democrats if they need to.",
      "Protecting parochial interests is among the oldest traditions on Capitol Hill, but it is an elevated imperative for Republicans in red states that are disproportionately dependent on Washington for money.",
      "Among the top 20 states that take more money from the federal government than they sent in tax payments, 13 are solidly red states that voted for Trump in the last three elections, according to an analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government into the fiscal 2024 budget. Meanwhile, the top five states (and nine of the top 10) that send more money to the Treasury Department than they receive voted for Democrats in the last three presidential elections.",
      "Another imperative for Republicans in rural areas is to protect farmers, who rely on the federal government as a major customer. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have targeted for dismantling,  administers the Food for Peace program, where the government buys and distributes American crops to help fight hunger around the world.",
      "A coalition of Republicans in rural states and districts, including House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., introduced legislation this week to save the Food for Peace program by transferring it to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "\u201cFor 70 years, Kansas and American farmers have played an active role in sending their commodities to feed malnourished and starving populations around the world. This free gift from the American people is more than food. It\u2019s diplomacy and feeds the most vulnerable communities,\u201d Rep. Tracey Mann, R-Kan., said in a statement.",
      "Mann, whose office said the program has \u201cfed more than 4 billion people in more than 150 countries,\u201d introduced the bill with Thompson and Reps. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., David Rouzer, R-N.C., as well as Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and John Hoeven, R-N.D.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs have also ruffled feathers among some of his otherwise solid allies on Capitol Hill. That includes Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa \u2014 the Senate president pro tempore and chair of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 who protested when Trump threatened to levy tariffs on imports from Canada.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m a free and fair trader,\u201d Grassley told NBC News. \u201cAnd the president was elected on a proposition of trying tariffs out.

      "\u201cIn Kentucky, local storeowners are already hearing about their suppliers\u2019 prices going up. One estimate suggests the president\u2019s tariffs could cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 each year,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about rising prices here at home. During the last Trump administration, retaliatory tariffs from trade partners set off a broader trade war that hit wide swaths of American industry, from agriculture to manufacturing to aerospace and motor vehicles to distilled spirits. Already, Canada announced retaliatory measures that take direct aim at Kentucky production, targeting products like peanut butter and whiskey.\u201d",
      "Paul, who often disagrees with McConnell, found common ground with him on that issue.",

If Trump and Elon want to cut funding for cancer research and infrastructure projects, they need to send us a proposal and try and win the votes in Congress to do it.\u201d"

      "NASA said last week that there is currently a 2.3% (or 1 in 43) chance that the asteroid, dubbed 2024 YR4, will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. While still tiny, that probability nearly doubled from the agency\u2019s initial estimate of 1.2% in late January.",

    "story": [
      "Nikocado Avocado, the popular YouTuber who shocked the internet with his 250-pound weight loss transformation last year, is ready to bamboozle his followers once more.",
      "On Wednesday, the creator, whose real name is Nicholas Perry, unveiled yet another body transformation to his 4.6 million subscribers. Perry said he underwent a handful of operations in which he removed at least 10 pounds of excess skin, the result of drastic weight loss.",
      "In recent months, the creator has dramatically scaled back on making daily videos, especially ones featuring popular \u201cmukbang\u201d content, in which he\u2019s seen eating enormous amounts of food on camera.",
      "As he navigated life in front of the camera after weight loss, Perry said he was \u201chiding my loose skin by positioning my body at certain angles, like paying close attention to my clothing and the lighting, but the truth is, I have loose skin in my abdomen, arms, legs, my torso, back, even my neck. I mean, it was everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never addressed it,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview before the surgery video was uploaded to YouTube. \u201cI\u2019ve ignored all the comments and questions.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s \u201cTwo Steps Ahead\u201d video from September remains one of his most successful uploads, garnering more than 50 million views on YouTube. But the success came with scrutiny from followers, old and new.",
      "\u201cI flaunted my big 400 pound belly and bounced it around with joy. I loved when people would make fun of me because it was engagement, and it was never that serious,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, people are analyzing my photos and wondering if I had plastic surgery, or did he have gastric bypass surgery, did he do Ozempic, did he do this or that.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Perry said he was ready to share what\u2019s been going on behind the scenes.\u00a0As he secretly recovered from a series of invasive body lift procedures, he slept carefully at a 45-degree angle every night with his limbs positioned on a \u201cmountain of pillows.\"",
      "While the recent procedures successfully removed the loose skin all around his body, Perry said they left him feeling like he\u2019d been \u201csawed in half, spun around and peeled open like an orange.\u201d",
      "Skin-tightening procedures have gained traction in recent years with the rise of weight loss medications like Ozempic, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",
      "But these are high-risk procedures with long, tedious recovery periods, Perry\u2019s plastic surgeon Dr. Timothy Katzen said. After a body lift, a patient must limit movement for weeks \u2014 which can necessitate taking two weeks to a month off work, depending on how much physical labor is required at their job.",
      "For Perry, these operations felt like the final step to closing out a weight loss journey that flabbergasted millions online.",
      "Perry, who said he has long held an extreme phobia of medical procedures, said he hopes being open about his journey will \u201cinspire people who are in similar positions\u201d to face their fears.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy thing having followers. I feel like a normal person just doing silly stuff. But at the end of the day, these are real people that have an infatuation with me for whatever reason,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIn a way, this kind of shows people that I\u2019m not special just because I have followers. Like everyone else, I have loose skin that was unavoidable, and I still have insecurities.\u201d",
      "As far as his personal brand goes, he said that in order to maintain his weight loss, he now posts mukbang videos only a few times a month compared to in the past, when he would often post himself eating massive meals once or twice a day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go back to eating that type of food and that quantity of food frequently,\u201d he said."

      "Poppi responds to the criticism",
      "Poppi says it owns the machines and they were never intended for one-time use, so all the influencers who received them will have to return them.",
      "\u201cBoth creators across the US and people in New Orleans received these machines,\u201d the spokesperson says, adding that its first consumer event with the machines took place at popular Tulane University hangout spot The Boot on Super Bowl Sunday.",
      "The brand says that this marks the first of many phases in this campaign.",
      "\u201cAs our beloved community has always been at the forefront of the poppi brand, these machines will be rolling out to them via events, social giveaways & nominations in the weeks to come,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cDespite false comments from our competitors, we are focused on revolutionizing soda for the next generation and can\u2019t wait for you all to see what\u2019s next.\u201d",
      "Then, on Feb. 10, Allison Ellsworth, Poppi\u2019s co-founder and chief brand officer, posted a TikTok addressing the drama.",

    "summary": "Enjoy 10 of our favorite \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches about parenting, including \"Christmas Robe,\" \"Mom Jeans\" and Pete Davidson playing himself.",
    "story": [
      "Every year for Mother's Day, \"Saturday Night Live\" sweetly tips its hat to the mothers of its cast members ... and all the moms in the audience, too.",
      "Perhaps they throw parents a bone to compensate for making fun of them the rest of the year.",
      "There are too many laugh-out-loud parenting sketches to count, but here are ten of our favorites.",
      "\"I am your mother\" (2013)",
      "This sketch shows the filming of a pizza roll commercial. Andy Samberg and Zac Efron play kid actors who come home and extol the virtues of said pizza rolls.",
      "\"It's way better than what she usually makes,\" Efron says, to which his \"mom\" Fred Armisen is supposed to playfully reply, \"Hey ... I am your mother!\"",
      "The only problem is that Armisen is incapable of delivering the line with anything other than super aggressive intensity. Each take is better than the last.",
      "\"Mom Jeans\" (2003)",
      "The \"Mom Jeans\" sketch put mom jeans on the map in real life. (And we're so glad it did because we're never going back to low rise!)",
      "Featuring Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Maya Rudolf, the sketch shows the women strutting through their day wearing jeans with \"a 9-inch zipper and casual front pleats\" that are blessedly \"cut generously.\"",
      "These jeans say, \"I'm not a woman anymore. I'm a mom!\"",
      "\"Protective mom 2\" (2023)",
      "Pedro Pascal playing an overprotective Latinx mom made such an impression that he reprised the role ... and this time musical guest Bad Bunny joins him as Tia Rosa.",
      "When Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez brings his new girlfriend (Chloe Troast) home to meet the family, chaos ensues. Pascal throws away the store-bought cookies Troast gives her and jokes in Spanish at her expense.",
      "But there's one thing everyone can agree on \u2014 Hern\u00e1ndez needs to eat more food.",
      "\"Can you pick me up?\" (2024)",
      "Have your kids ever called you to pick them up early from a sleepover without embarrassing them?",
      "This sketch is a montage of \"pick me up calls\" to \"mom\" Maya Rudolf and \"dad\" Kenan Thompson. While Rudolf shows up with a bevy of fanciful excuses for the host parents (like an unexpected 2 a.m. funeral), Thompson tells it like it is: \"Your daughter's mean and your house smells weird.\"",
      "\"Christmas Robe\" (2020)",
      "In this sketch, \"kids\" Kyle Mooney and Chloe Fineman and their \"dad\" Beck Bennett list all the extravagant gifts they received for Christmas while \"mom\" Kirstin Wiig got ... a bathrobe and an empty Christmas stocking.",
      "As her family's gifts pile up, Wiig, who says she was up until 4 a.m. Christmas Eve, burns her arm while trying to make breakfast.",
      "She says, \"It hurt pretty bad but I didn't even scream 'cause I keep the pain inside of me.\"",
      "\"Pete Davidson on Living With His Mom\" (2019)",
      "The best part of this sketch is Pete Davidson playing Pete Davidson.",
      "He tells the Weekend Update audience that he bought a house with his mother and now, along with his sister, they live there together. His mom, Amy Davidson, appears on the segment wearing a sweatshirt with her face and Pete's face on it.",
      "\"It's weird living with my mom and sister because sometimes I'll see a strange dude in the house and I don't know if he's some dirtbag preying on my sister or the saint who's going to take my mom off my hands,\" he says.",
      "\"Best Christmas Ever\" (2018)",
      "In another holiday sketch, Matt Damon and Cecily Strong play parents who sit down to relax at the end of a long Christmas Day.",
      "As they reminisce about how \"wonderful\" the day was, a series of images of screaming children and overstimulated parents flood the screen. From hard-to-build presents to disagreeable family, the day had as many lows as it did highs.",
      "The last screen shows exactly what every parent knows about Christmas: \"Even when it's the worst, it's the best.\"",
      "\"Home videos\" (2024)",
      "Trouble brews when \"mom\" Dakota Johnston and \"dad\" Mikey Day pop a taped episode of a Maury Povich-type show in the VCR for their son Andrew Dismukes.",
      "The episode just so happens to feature guests Johnston and Day in their younger years, and it reveals an upsetting series of family secrets.",
      "\"The Perfect Mother\" (2019)",
      "In the same vein as \"Best Christmas Ever,\" this sketch shows toddler mom Heidi Gardner and her mother, Emma Thompson, trading compliments about their mothering skills while flashbacks show how flawed they really are.",
      "Thompson forgot to wear pants and read her daughter's diary while Gardner screamed at her husband and certainly did not \"cherish every moment.\"",
      "As the women hug, Thompson says, \"You have poop in your hair.\"",
      "\"Mother monologue\" (2024)",
      "No one but the incomparable Maya Rudolf, mom of four, could have delivered this \"Vogue\" style dance song with such flair.",
      "\"Look, you're not just a mom,\" explains Bowen Yang. \"You're 'Mother.'\"",
      "\"This is Maya's house now,\" says Kenan Thompson to introduce the song. \"I give to you Mother of the House of Rockefeller.\"",
      "Wearing an intergalactic irridescent bodysuit, Rudolf stomps her way through the halls of 30 Rock and like the cast, we are \"gagged.\""

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "\u201cI stressed that my foremost commitment is to Jordan, to its stability and to the well-being of Jordanians,\u201d he said on X.\u00a0\u201cI reiterated Jordan\u2019s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the day, Abdullah told Trump he could take in 2,000 Palestinian children from Gaza who are very sick or have cancer. But the king later confirmed his longstanding position against displacing millions of Palestinians from their homes as Trump has suggested.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump said during their meeting Tuesday that he expected progress toward his plan and believed \u201c99%\u201d that something could be worked out with Egypt, another regional partner that had bristled at the president's surprise. \"We'll have some others helping,\" Trump added.",
      "Seated with Trump in the Oval Office, Abdullah said they must ensure a plan that satisfies all parties, a not insignificant obstacle as questions remain about how each country might move to relocate a swell of people who have suffered months of devastation, and which some fear will further undermine efforts to create a Palestinian state. More than 1 million Palestinians remain without homes, and the king declined to say whether he would be willing to take in refugees in larger numbers. \"We have to look at the best interests of the United States, of the people in the region, especially to my people of Jordan,\" he said.",
      "Questioned further by reporters about Trump\u2019s ideas, the king said he would refrain from saying much until Egypt had a chance to weigh in. His statement following the meeting with Trump made clear that the sides remain far apart.",
      "\u201cRebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,\u201d he said on X. \u201cAchieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability.\u201d",
      "There are already over 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan,\u00a0according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees,\u00a0which says that most of them have citizenship. Jordan's Queen Rania and her family were Palestinian refugees who fled Kuwait.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to \u201cown\u201d the Gaza Strip and relocate its residents has stirred opposition from the U.S.\u2019s Arab partners and from world leaders across the globe who largely favor a two-state solution. However, Trump has not ceded the proposal and continued in the days since to press his ideas to take over and develop the territory after first announcing it last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s visit to the White House.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Monday night, Trump said that those leaving Gaza would not have a right to return and named Egypt and Jordan as two countries that he expects to take in Palestinians. Trump said it\u2019s a project he wants to start \u201calmost immediately.\u201d He has referred to the territory as a demolition site.",
      "On Tuesday, he billed it as a step toward bringing \u201cpeace to the Middle East\u201d and said it would become a driver of new jobs in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run it very properly,\u201d Trump told reporters and reiterated his ideas for a development plan for the territory that includes hotels and other investments. Seated to the president's left were top advisers and officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, chief of staff Susie Wiles and national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a death trap,\u201d Trump said of Gaza as he mused about the possibilities. He said that it's a place where no one would want to stay, and \u201cthey are living in hell.\u201d",
      "Asked if he would consider withholding U.S. aid, Trump suggested he had moved on from the idea, telling reporters, \u201cI do think we\u2019re above that.\u201d",
      "\"We contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt, by the way, a lot to both, but I don\u2019t have to threaten that,\" Trump said, seeming to walk back the suggestion that he was open to it.",
      "A reliable U.S. partner, Abdullah now finds himself weighing a tentative path forward after America\u2019s Arab partners, including Jordan and Egypt, rejected Trump\u2019s proposal last week. On the eve of his meeting with Trump, the U.S. president threatened to cut off aid to Jordan, an annual sum of more than $1 billion. American foreign aid is currently paused as part of a sweeping halt by the Trump administration.",
      "A senior Jordanian official told NBC News\u00a0last week there was no way that Jordan could accept more refugees after harboring large refugee populations for decades from Syria and other countries in the region. But\u00a0Jordan relies heavily on U.S. aid \u2014 and additional U.S. spending in Jordan goes to defend U.S. interests supporting Syrian Defense Force allies guarding ISIS prisoners in Syria \u2014 and preventing a resurgence of ISIS in Syria.",
      "Trump's plan is also a nonstarter with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 a key U.S. partner who rejected it within an hour of Trump\u2019s initial comments last week.",
      "Jordan, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday, would resettle Palestinians from Gaza, as would other surrounding countries, because they have \u201cgood hearts.\u201d He said his administration had spoken to Palestinians who \u201cwould love to leave Gaza if they could find a place to be,\u201d as well as leaders in the region whom he said were working to find a solution to the devastation caused by more than 15 months of war between Hamas and Israel.",
      "\u201cThey were very positive about providing land,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat we need is land, and if we could build a nice place for people to live safely, everybody in Gaza would do it.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThey would love to get out of Gaza, but until now, they\u2019ve never had an alternative. Now they have an alternative.\u201d",
      "A fragile ceasefire has paused the fighting in Gaza, but the conflict risks reigniting as Hamas said it will postpone the release of more hostages. Trump has warned Hamas to release all remaining hostages by Saturday, but warned Tuesday that he believes they could blow past it.",
      "Netanyahu said Tuesday in a video statement posted to X that Israel is prepared to terminate the ceasefire agreement if Hamas does not return all the remaining hostages by Saturday."

      "The war in the Gaza Strip is on pause following a complex agreement in which the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are incrementally exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.",
      "But Hamas said late Monday that it was indefinitely postponing the next hostage-prisoner swap Saturday, accusing Israel of continuing to shoot at Palestinians, stopping them from moving back to the northern part of the strip and delaying the entry of medical supplies and shelters.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an emergency meeting with his security Cabinet in Jerusalem on Tuesday to discuss how to move forward, an Israeli official briefed on the matter told NBC News.",
      "Three more hostages were set to be freed from Gaza in an exchange scheduled for Saturday. But Trump responded to Hamas\u2019 delay by demanding that all 76 remaining captives, 44 of whom are believed to be alive, are freed.",
      "\u201cIf all of the hostages aren\u2019t returned by Saturday at 12 o\u2019clock \u2014 I think it\u2019s an appropriate time \u2014 I would say cancel\u201d the ceasefire, he told reporters, without specifying whether he meant noon or midnight.",
      "Asked for specifics about what he meant by \u201chell,\u201d he said, \u201cHamas will find out what I mean.\u201d",
      "The prospect of resuming a war in which more than 48,000 Gazans have been killed has alarmed international observers, as well as Palestinians in the enclave and the families of the hostages, most of whom were among the 250 people kidnapped during the Hamas-led terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed.",
      "\u201cWe must avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to immense tragedy,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a statement. \u201cI appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages. Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "Even before Hamas announced its delay in freeing hostages, confidence in the ceasefire has been shaken by Trump\u2019s repeated statements that he wants to permanently remove Palestinians from Gaza so the United States can develop the war zone as a real estate opportunity.",
      "\"I would own this \u2014 think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,\" Trump said Monday, contradicting his own aides, who had said the Palestinians' relocation would be temporary.",
      "\"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities,\" he said, \"a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is.\"",
      "That has alarmed many governments and experts, who point out that forcibly removing people from their homes is classed as ethnic cleansing under international law. Trump suggested he could revoke aid for Egypt and Jordan if they continued to refuse to rehome Gaza's 2 million-plus population.",
      "\u201cYeah, maybe, sure why not?\u201d Trump, who met with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah at the White House on Tuesday, said when he was asked about ceasing financial assistance to the two countries.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan, which is facing famine amid it's 2-year civil war.",
    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed by a hippo during an African safari has filed a lawsuit alleging that their tour operator was negligent in failing to keep her safe.",
      "Craig Manders says in the suit that he witnessed the horrifying death of his wife Lisa, 70, who was killed in Zambia last year during a safari organized by a Connecticut company, African Portfolio.",
      "\u201cHad we understood the dangers posed by the hippopotamus, we never would have agreed to be in such close contact while on foot,\u201d Manders said in a statement released by his attorneys, Paul Slager and Nicole Coates.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we were unwittingly exposed to such an extreme danger, a danger made even worse by our tour guides leaving Lisa alone on foot with nothing between her and such a deadly animal, is nothing short of astonishing.\u201d",
      "Rod Gould, a lawyer for African Portfolio, described the incident as a terrible but \"really unusual\" tragedy. He said the company arranges tours and works with the most reputable safari lodges in Africa but is not responsible for what goes on during the trips.",
      "\"My client is a tour operator. It organizes tours,\" Gould said. \"A trip, for example, might include airfare. We're not responsible if the airline loses luggage.\"",
      "In the suit filed in Stamford Superior Court, Manders says he and his wife left the U.S. on May 31, 2024, for a 10-day safari in Zambia, a country in southern Africa.",
      "Five days later, the couple went on a \u201cbush walk\u201d with guides who led them to a riverbank where a lone hippopotamus was resting in the water, the suit says. Known for being fiercely territorial and aggressive, hippos are among the most dangerous animals on Earth.",
      "Despite their size \u2013 adult males typically weigh over 3,000 pounds \u2013 hippos can run fast over short distances, reaching speeds upward of 20 mph.",
      "The guides \u201cknew or should have known that the close presence of the wild hippopotamus to participants in the Bush Walk posed an immediate and extreme danger, due to the known tendencies of hippopotami to be highly unpredictable, territorial, and aggressive in such circumstances,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "But the guides, including at least one armed with a rifle, left the area, the suit says, leaving the Manders and others in their group to observe the hippo without any protection.",
      "Then, without warning, the hippo lifted its head and charged out of the water toward Lisa Manders, according to the lawsuit. The massive animal caught up with Manders and attacked her, the suit says.",
      "\u201cAlthough Lisa Manders attempted to flee, she was unable to escape and the hippopotamus violently attacked her, grabbing her by its mouth, lifting her off the ground, shaking her entire body, and crushing her head and body with its bite,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Lisa Manders suffered \u201ccatastrophic injuries\u201d and died shortly after, according to the lawsuit, which noted that her husband witnessed the attack.",
      "A mother of three from Cranford, Manders worked in the financial industry for more than 40 years. \u201cLisa was the best mother and wife anyone could ever hope for,\u201d her husband said. \u201cHer violent death is a devastating loss not only for our family, but for our community.\"",
      "The lawsuit does not identify where in Zambia the attack occurred, but the country\u2019s minister of tourism was quoted in a local news report lamenting the death of an American tourist killed by a hippo at the Lower Zambezi National Park on June 5, 2024.",
      "The government\u2019s \u201cthoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the deceased, even as investigations continue on the incident,\u201d the tourism minister, Rodney Sikumba, said in a statement, according to Radio Christian Voice.",
      "Craig Manders\u2019 attorneys described the incident as an awful tragedy that was \u201centirely preventable.\u201d",
      "\u201cInteracting with the natural world in the wilderness can be an incredibly rich experience,\u201d said Slager, of Slager Madry LLC. \u201cBut wilderness guides and tour operators like African Portfolio carry the responsibility to ensure basic safety precautions are taken to ensure customers visiting the African wilderness are not unnecessarily exposed to extreme dangers.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone Wednesday about ending the war in Ukraine and that Putin indicated he would be willing to negotiate directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social about their first known call of his second term.",
      "\"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\" he added. \"We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\"",
      "Trump said he tasked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff with leading negotiations with Russia.",
      "Putin adviser Dmitry Peskov said the phone conversation lasted about 90 minutes.",
      "\"The topic of the Middle East settlement, the Iranian nuclear program, and bilateral Russian-American relations in the economic area were talked about during the conversation,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow, Peskov said, \"and expressed readiness to receive American officials in Russia regarding areas of mutual interest, including, of course, the topic of Ukrainian settlement. Putin and Trump also agreed to continue personal contacts, including setting up a personal meeting.\"",
      "Trump later confirmed that he had spoken to Zelenskyy, saying in another post on Truth Social that the discussion \u201cwent very well\u201d and that Zelenskyy also wants peace. Trump said a meeting related to the war, led by Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, would take place Friday in Munich.",
      "\u201cI am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!\u201d he wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy said on X that he had a \"meaningful conversation\" with Trump. \"No one wants peace more than Ukraine,\" he wrote. \"Together with the U.S., we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let\u2019s get it done.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a visit to NATO's headquarters in Brussels that it's \"unrealistic\" for Ukraine to return to its borders before Russia invaded its Crimea region in 2014. He also signaled that the United States wouldn't support Ukraine's joining NATO as part of a negotiated deal to end the war.",
      "The Trump administration also helped secure the release of American teacher Marc Fogel from Russia on Tuesday in exchange for the release of Alexander Vinnik, a convicted money launderer who is in U.S. custody and was awaiting transportation back to Russia by the end of the week. Russia had detained Fogel for 3\u00bd years after he was arrested for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Trump suggested Sunday that he had already spoken to Putin \u2014 which would have been their first known call since 2022 \u2014 though Peskov said Sunday that he would \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d that a conversation took place.",
      "Ukraine-Russia relations have remained tense since the war began in February 2022.",
      "Last month, Zelenskyy said on X, \u201cPutin once again confirmed that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders, and does everything possible to prolong the war.\" The comment came in response to Putin's telling a Russian state broadcaster that Zelenskyy \u201chas no right to sign anything\u201d because of his \u201cillegitimacy.\u201d",
      "The resurrection of a potentially positive U.S.-Russia relationship is a departure from the last four years. The Biden administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia over the last three years, and President Joe Biden also authorized numerous aid packages to Ukraine to provide both humanitarian assistance and weapons and equipment.",
      "It's unclear whether the Republican-led Congress will continue supporting legislative aid packages to Ukraine, as many GOP lawmakers have opposed continuing to fund the U.S. effort to defend Ukraine, a close ally. Even in the last Congress, divisions among GOP lawmakers significant delayed deliveries of weapons to Ukraine.",
      "Trump has for years, including Wednesday, claimed that the war never would have happened had he been president at the time of the invasion. On the campaign trail, including in a meeting with Zelenskyy in September, he repeatedly said he would negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine that's \"good for both sides.\" Last month, he also suggested that Ukraine shouldn't have fought back against Russia's invasion.",
      "He has also said he would end the war before his second term began or on the first day of his new administration."

      "While there has been a popular and long-standing movement calling for independence from Denmark in Greenland, most of the island\u2019s 56,000 inhabitants \u2014 the majority from Inuit tribes \u2014 appear to agree that it is not for sale.",

      "The remarks are the clearest indication yet that the United States will support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in which Ukraine cedes territory that\u2019s already been seized by the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,\u201d Hegseth\u00a0said in a speech during a trip to NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. \u201cBut we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.\u201d",
      "\u201cChasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\u201d he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at which Western allies discuss Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. \u201cWe will only end this devastating war \u2014 and establish a durable peace \u2014 by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield.\u201d",

      "The defense secretary is part of a high-level Trump team touring Europe this week, with allies eager to learn how this ambitious plan might come about. Many Ukrainians are hopeful of Trump\u2019s ability to end the conflict; others fear his negotiations will force them to accept unfavorable terms and embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "However, these guarantees should not include giving Ukraine NATO membership, as it has long desired, but instead have non-American troops \u201cdeployed as peacekeepers\u201d to the country, he said. These personnel should not be deployed as a NATO mission, or be covered by the alliance\u2019s Article 5 guarantee, under which allies agree to step in if any member is attacked, he added.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump will seek to pressure the Kremlin by \u201cunleashing American energy production\u201d and thus throttling Russian exports that fund its war machine, Hegseth said. But he made clear that European nations would be required to provide most of the military support for Ukraine \u2014 which is currently underwritten by Washington more than any other nation.",
      "He said he was in Brussels to \u201cdirectly and unambiguously express\u00a0that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being the primary guarantor of security in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States faces consequential threats to our homeland.

      "There will be a record 116 medal events over 16 days sandwiched between the opening ceremony at Milan\u2019s famed San Siro Stadium and the closing ceremony at the historic Verona Arena, a Roman amphitheater.",
      "The U.S., which finished in the top five in total medals at the last six Winter Olympics, is loaded with stars, both in returning gold medalists and athletes who broke through since the last Winter Games, in 2022.",

      "Shiffrin, who turns 30 on March 13, also missed time after race crashes in January 2024 and again last November. She recently returned to competition after being sidelined for two months.",
      "Her best events are slalom, where she has won six of her last seven World Cup starts, and giant slalom.",
      "At the Milan Cortina Games, Shiffrin can become the first American skier to win a third career Olympic gold medal and the oldest U.S. woman to win Olympic Alpine gold. She is already the youngest American to win an Olympic Alpine medal of any color via her slalom gold in 2014 at 18.",
      "Lindsey Vonn wants one more Olympics",
      "Now 40, Lindsey Vonn ended a five-year retirement to race this season, but her ultimate goal is to make a fifth Olympic team and retire for good after the Milan Cortina Games.",
      "Before Shiffrin, Vonn held the record for women\u2019s World Cup wins (82). She remains the lone American woman to win Olympic downhill gold in 2010.",
      "She retired in 2019 due to the physical toll of ski racing injuries accumulated over an 18-year career on the sport\u2019s highest level.",
      "But Vonn was reinvigorated after partial right knee replacement surgery last April. \u201cTo be able to ski without pain, it\u2019s a completely new world for me,\u201d she said before her first World Cup race in December. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in 15 years.\u201d",

      "Malinin, the son of Olympic skaters from Uzbekistan (who coach him in Virginia), is the two-time reigning world champion. He has won eight competitions in a row dating to December 2023.",
      "He has dominated largely due to his unprecedented arsenal of jumps. In September 2022, he became the first skater to land a clean quadruple axel in competition, the only type of quad jump that had yet to be done.",
      "This season, Malinin continued to live up to his self-given nickname \u2014 \u201cQuad God\u201d \u2014 by becoming the first skater to perform all six types of quad jumps in one program (though not all cleanly landed). He also incorporated a backflip into his free skate.",
      "Malinin has filled the void left by Nathan Chen, who stepped away from competing after winning the 2022 Olympic title. He can become the second American to take men\u2019s singles gold in his Olympic debut after the late Dick Button in 1948.",

Though she has taken defeats, she won the biggest annual event in the sport, the X Games, in 2024 and 2025.",
      "\u201cI have to be honest; I was in a bit of a rut. I really did not enjoy snowboarding for a couple of years,\u201d Kim, now 24, said last month. \u201cI think this year I really wanted to change that and just do runs that felt good to me, do tricks that felt good to me. It kind of has been working out, no complaints.\u201d",

      "Now Stolz is favored to earn three medals in long track speedskating in 2026, just like Ohno did in short track in 2006 and 2010. Unlike Ohno, Stolz\u2019s could all be gold.",
      "He is the two-time reigning world champion in the 500 meter, 1,000 meter and 1,500 meter and the world record holder in the 1,000 meter. He won 18 World Cup races in a row from February 2024 to January 2025.",
      "He can become the second American to win three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics. The first was an athlete to whom Stolz is often compared: Eric Heiden, a fellow Wisconsinite who won all five speedskating events at the 1980 Lake Placid Games in arguably the greatest feat in Winter Olympics history.",
      "Here comes Jessie Diggins, again",
      "To many, Jessie Diggins is best known for clinching the first U.S. Olympic cross-country skiing gold medal \u2014 \u201cHere comes Diggins!\u201d was the famed broadcast call by Chad Salmela at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.",
      "In the seven years since, Diggins achieved many more firsts, including the first individual world title for a U.S. cross-country skier and two World Cup overall season titles. She now owns an Olympic medal of every color and two world championship medals of every color.",
      "Diggins has also shared her personal challenges. In June 2018, she published \u201cthe most important blog post I\u2019ll ever write,\u201d detailing her experience with an eating disorder when she was a teenager.",
      "Diggins disclosed before last season that she had overcome a relapse. Her medical team, ski team, family and friends helped her through it.",
      "She still races with \u201cThe Emily Program\u201d written on a patch on her headband. As a teen, Diggins checked in to the program, a national leader in eating disorder treatment, in her native Minnesota.",
      "Diggins, who got married in 2022, does not know how much longer she will compete. She has committed at least to a fourth Olympic run in 2026. She can become the first U.S. cross-country skier to win an individual gold medal."

      "BEIJING \u2014 A Chinese animated film about a mythical child with a punk attitude and superpowers has become China\u2019s highest-grossing movie of all time, stoking national pride and potentially setting more records as it premieres overseas.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d has earned almost almost $1.3 billion in the two weeks since it was released in mainland China, according to the Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. In addition to being the most successful film in Chinese box office history, it is the first non-Hollywood film to earn more than $1 billion and the first film in the world to earn more than $1 billion in a single market.",
      "The movie is set for a limited release in the United States starting Friday.",
      "Inspired by a famous Chinese legend, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d tells the story of a child deity named Ne Zha who rebels against his destiny and uses magical powers to protect his community from formidable enemies. It\u2019s the sequel to a hit movie released in 2019 that became the highest-grossing Chinese animated film at the time.",
      "Chinese moviegoers have showered the new film with praise, taking pride in the fact that it is entirely Chinese-made, from the director to the special effects and postproduction teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a purely Chinese animated film, deeply rooted in Chinese cultural heritage,\u201d said Nianyi Zhao, 29, an independent film critic in China. \u201cRegardless of how the story is structured, Chinese audiences are willing to support it as a way of promoting domestic animation and sharing Chinese culture with the world.\u201d",
      "Its success has been hailed as a sign of China\u2019s advances in filmmaking and the declining influence of Hollywood in China amid a growing cultural and national identity.",
      "\u201cThe film masterfully blends traditional Eastern aesthetics \u2014 such as Dunhuang murals and ink painting \u2014 with modern animation technology,\u201d said Neo Liu, a 31-year-old illustration designer from Beijing. \u201cIt was an impressive visual experience.\u201d",
      "Jiaozi, also known as Yang Yu, who directed and wrote both \u201cNe Zha\u201d films, told Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV\u00a0that he had tried to outsource key visual work to top overseas studios, but the results fell short due to \u201carrogance and prejudice.\u201d",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d \u2014 whose Jan. 29 release coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday, a major moviegoing period \u2014 has brought a glimmer of hope to China\u2019s languishing film market, whose total box office last year was 34% lower than its pre-Covid peak in 2019, according to data from the China Film Administration.",
      "The film helped the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after North America, take in a record 9.5 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) during the eight-day Lunar New Year holiday, according to Maoyan, in a bright spot for Chinese officials struggling to boost consumer spending amid an economic slump.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d quickly eclipsed China\u2019s previous highest-grossing film, 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of Lake Changjin,\u201d a Korean War drama typical of the patriotic epics that have dominated the Chinese box office in recent years.",
      "It could also be on course to surpass last year\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the highest-grossing animated film of all time.",
      "Chinese state media have touted \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d as the latest in a series of Chinese cultural successes including last year\u2019s hit video game Black Myth: Wukong, the recent rush of American TikTok users to the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, and the market-moving rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek.",
      "\u201cThe reason these products from different fields have been able to break through visible or invisible barriers and create an international buzz lies in the strong demand for exchanges in trade, culture, and public opinion between China and the world,\u201d the state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times said in an editorial on Wednesday.",
      "Asked Wednesday about the success of \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Chinese films \u201care building new bridges for communication between China and other countries, and opening up a new window for the world to understand China.\u201d",
      "The film has also connected with Chinese audiences who see the character of Ne Zha as an anti-hero whose \u201cfighting spirit\u201d against authority and hierarchy serves as a counterpoint to the popular concept of \u201clying flat,\u201d or doing the bare minimum to get by in life while rejecting the relentless economic pressure of Chinese society.",
      "\u201cThis movie is so inspiring,\u201d read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cWe young people are very easily defeated in life but maybe we should live passionately, just like Ne Zha.\u201d",
      "The fanfare continues to build, with movie merchandise flying off the shelves and the film projected to earn nearly $2 billion in China alone.",
      "On Weibo, a hashtag called #NeZhaBoxOfficeRaisingNationalFlag is quickly gaining traction with billions of views, and many young people have said they are willing to pay to watch the movie multiple times to help boost its ranking.",
      "Not everyone is so effusive about the film.",
      "\u201cCompared to other movies from the same period, I guess I like it \u2014but mostly because the local Chinese films in recent years have been pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Ginger Zhang, a 29-year-old in Beijing.",
      "Vanessa Huang, a 31-year-old working in law, said she liked the movie and planned to watch it again, but it was not without flaws.",
      "\u201cNe Zha\u00a0in the original story has a strong anti-patriarchal theme, which wasn\u2019t really reflected in the film,\u201d she said. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s still a solid work.\u201d"
