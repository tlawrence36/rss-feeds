      "As The Associated Press\u2019 music writer, Maria Sherman has seen more than 80 concerts in 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- As The Associated Press\u2019 music writer, Maria Sherman has seen more than 80 concerts in 2024. Here are some of her picks for the best and biggest shows of the year. Most shows on this list were seen in the New York metropolitan area \u2014 unless otherwise noted \u2014 and it excludes most one-off performances that cannot be repeated. Take a look at where you too can catch these artists.",
      "Dec. 17, Barclays Center",
      "At the end of the year, when most massive pop tours come to an end, who else is there to take up the mantle but the Queen of Christmas, Mariah Carey? During her 2024 seasonal run, Carey performed holiday classics \u2014 both her own and the standards \u2014 and broke from the format just slightly to hit a medley of her biggest hits: \u201cEmotions,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d \u201cFantasy\u201d and \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d among them.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: The closer of her enduring classic, \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d But for the final night of her tour in Brooklyn, there was an unexpected surprise \u2014 Rihanna was in the audience, and Carey signed her chest during an arena-wide sing-along of \u201cAlways Be My Baby.\u201d",
      "OPENER: Come on, like the Queen of Christmas needs an introduction.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Carey's Christmas shows have become something of a yearly tradition, so just wait until 2025.",
      "Oct. 10, Carnegie Hall",
      "For the second time in her career, Natalia Lafourcade performed at Carnegie Hall, joined by Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. There was nothing stuffy about it \u2014 the crowd danced in the aisles as the four-time Grammy Award winner made the historic venue come alive with her Latin folk, rock, bossa nova and cumbia.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Near the end of the performance, Lafourcade was joined by Jon Batiste for an improvised set. Suddenly, the hallowed halls of Carnegie Hall felt intimate, like a private rehearsal.",
      "OPENER: None.",

      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Le\u00f3n has a few more dates scheduled for April 2025, including in Florida and North Carolina.",
      "Aug. 3, UBS Arena",
      "It is almost unbelievable: Before 2024, Missy Elliott had never headlined her own arena tour. And, the last tour she went on was in 2004, performing alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and Alicia Keys. Two decades later, the multihyphenate decided it was finally time to hit the road again for a true pop spectacle. And just like the title suggests, it was \u201cout of this world.\u201d",
      "HIGHLIGHT: She's one of the most influential artists of the last 30 years, so pick your favorite: \u201cGet Ur Freak On,\u201d \u201cWork It,\u201d \u201cLose Control\u201d \u2014 the show was nonstop, a high-energy explosion that felt more like a once-in-a-lifetime event than a concert.",
      "OPENER: Busta Rhymes and Ciara, Elliott's day one collaborators, joined for a show that felt like a party in outer space.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: The tour has ended but catch Elliott at Coachella next spring.",
      "June 7-9, Flushing Meadows Corona Park",
      "Look, summer music festivals aren't for everyone. But every once in a while, an institution will surprise you, for not only actually booking the superstars of today, well, today \u2014 but also by featuring an eclectic mix of talent. This year, Governors Ball delivered.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Now is the time to run, don\u2019t walk, to see Chappell Roan. But you already knew that. You've had the \u201cHot to Go\u201d dance committed to memory for ages now.",
      "OPENER: Sexyy Red\u2019s raunchy rap is a feature of many playlists for a reason.",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Next June, back in New York.",

      "OPENER: Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town, with Stapleton joining Strait for their 2024 collaboration, \u201cHonky Tonk Hall of Fame.\u201d",
      "SEE IT YOURSELF: Strait doesn't have forthcoming shows scheduled but never say never.",
      "May 23, MetLife Stadium",
      "One of the greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll bands of all time plays two hours of nonstop hits, pulling from their 60-year discography and then some. What else could you ask for?",

      "April 5, Madison Square Garden",
      "Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s glossy pop-punk is for the all-ages crowd and felt deeply by all. If women performing their rage has fallen out of vogue, Rodrigo has brought it back, full force.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Honestly? Whatever your favorite Olivia Rodrigo song is!",
      "OPENER: The Breeders \u2014 fronted by the Pixies\u2019 Kim Deal \u2014 legends of \u201990s college radio and indie rock.",

      "Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent free",
      "NEW YORK -- Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent-free. And it's grabbed the attention of the Grammys.",
      "The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (\u201cWithout Me\u201d), Selena Gomez (\u201cBack to You\u201d) and Tate McRae (\u201cGreedy\u201d). Her contributions to Harry Styles' \u201cHarry's House\u201d earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Ros\u00e9, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake.",
      "2024, however, was the year Allen's work became inescapable \u2014 thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s bubbly \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d including \u201cEspresso,\u201d an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone's favorite lyric? \u201cHeartbreak is one thing, my ego\u2019s another / I beg you, don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)",
      "This fall, Allen's work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks \u2014 an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "\u201cOnce the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,\u201d Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them.",
      "When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d is up for album of the year and \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d for song of the year.",
      "Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for \u201cBetter Place,\u201d a collaboration with NSYNC for \u201cTrolls: Band Together.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,\u201d said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d of Allen.",
      "\u201cShe just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, \u2018anything is possible today,\u2019\u201d added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter's album. \u201cThe ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.\u201d",
      "Allen's path to professional songwriting wasn't necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option.",
      "\u201cI had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she\u2019s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspresso\u201d came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones \u201cwere kids having fun and laughing and playing,\u201d Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track's cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (\u201cthat's that me espresso\u201d).",
      "Allen believes \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d found success through its quirky, playful pop \u2014 because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective.",
      "\u201cThe general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it\u2019s almost impossible for the public to turn away.\u201d",
      "In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff\u2019s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from \u201cAmy Allen,\u201d her self-titled debut album released in September \u2014 a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop.",
      "Touring those songs came with a realization. \u201cI love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,\u201d said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song \u201cIssues.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to go after both,\u201d Allen said.",

      "The siblings behind the band The Black Crowes had just released their debut album \u201cShake Your Money Maker\u201d and were nominees for best new artist. They didn't have high hopes. Sure enough, Mariah Carey would take the crown.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t remember ever like getting too worked up about it,\u201d singer-songwriter Chris Robinson recalls. \u201cOf course, Mariah Carey is going to get that. Are they going to give it to these dirtbag kids from Atlanta who just came to the party really to get thrown out?\u201d",
      "Fast forward more than three decades and the Black Crowes have been invited back to the party, earning their second career Grammy nod this year for best rock album alongside the Rolling Stones.",
      "\u201cLiterally just to be nominated is an amazing thing. And to be nominated next to the Rolling Stones makes it even better,\u201d says Rich Robinson, the songwriter and guitarist.",
      "The Black Crowes' rollicking \"Happiness Bastards\" is up for best rock album against \u201cRomance\u201d by Fontaines D.C., \u201cSaviors\u201d by Green Day, \u201cTANGK\u201d by IDLES, \u201cDark Matter\u201d from Pearl Jam, \u201cHackney Diamonds\u201d by the Stones and \u201cNo Name\u201d from Jack White.",
      "\u201cTo be in a place where it\u2019s all clicking and it all feels right, that\u2019s the real special feeling,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cI think it reinforces our commitment and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappiness Bastards\u201d is a 10-track romping tour of rock, from the Southern boogie of \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d to the stuttering stomp of \u201cCross Your Fingers\u201d and the airy cool of \u201cWilted Rose.\u201d There's blues harmonica, some glam rock, '70s harmonies and fun AC/DC-like riffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funky and it\u2019s rockin' and it\u2019s kind of a little bit salty here and there. But ultimately, I think it\u2019s very interesting,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s just integrated with everything that we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "The band last released a studio album in 2009, and the volatile Robinson brothers needed a decade apart before they regrouped in 2019. In 2022, they released an EP with covers of David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, T. Rex, Little Feat and Rod Stewart. Now they're in the same Grammy category as the Stones.",
      "Critics have welcomed the brothers back, with Paste magazine calling the new album \u201ca respectable collection of bluesy rockers that showcase the brothers\u2019 strengths\u201d and Rolling Stone describing it as \u201cfun, energetic and, unmistakably not-crusty.\u201d",
      "Some cynics thought the reunion was simply a cash grab, an attempt to monetize fans of the band yearning for the '90s and a good-time rock concert. The strong album and Grammy love refutes that argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we did it and we\u2019ve been successful. And all these years later we wrote these new songs and, boom, here we are,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cThe validation of that is really unique to us.\u201d",
      "The way the brothers come up with a song hadn't changed over the years. During the pandemic, Rich started sending a flood of ideas to his brother to see what clicked with him.",
      "Chris wrote the lyrics for \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d in 20 minutes after Rich \u2014 inspired by AC/DC \u2014 sent him a killer riff. \u201cRich just handed me a hanging curveball. \u2018I can hit this,\u2019 you know what I mean?\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have to emphasize how much fun we\u2019re having in this band.\u201d",
      "One difference this time was the addition of an outside producer. The Robinson brothers had produced all The Black Crowes albums after their second and wanted a new element.",
      "\u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s bring in someone that\u2019s going to challenge us a little bit and maybe would have a point of view that we don\u2019t have.\u2019 Someone that can look at everything from 10,000 feet,\u201d says Rich Robinson.",
      "That happened with producer Jay Joyce, who has worked with artists like Cage the Elephant, Lainey Wilson and Eric Church. Joyce pushed them and was able to negotiate the sibling rivalry, what some call the U.S. equivalent to Oasis.",
      "\u201cOur story connects with people because if you have siblings, you understand the dynamic of that \u2014 how amazing it is and how difficult it can be,\u201d says Chris Robinson.",
      "His brother agrees: \u201cWe\u2019ve had our ups and downs, we've had our trials and tribulations, and we kind of came out stronger in the end. Chris and I\u2019s relationship is in the best place it\u2019s been probably in our lives.\u201d",
      "The brothers hint about that on the album's last song \u2014 \u201cKindred Friends\u201d \u2014 which strikes a loving, wistful note. \u201cKindred friend, where have you been?/Guess it's been a while/Through thick and thin/Many times again/Always makes me smile.\u201d",
      "The Robinsons say the song is partly about them but could be a toast to an old lover and is also reaching out to their fans after all these years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sweetness to it,\u201d says Rich Robinson. \u201cI sent it to Chris and what he sang on it was really moving. It\u2019s a great way to end that record, you know?\u201d",

In \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn\u2019t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz\u2019s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the \u201cmeet cute.\u201d (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d: I\u2019ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d the Christmas backdrop isn\u2019t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cKlaus\u201d: There\u2019s such a steady stream of mediocre or worse holiday movies that it can be easy to miss when a gem arrives. Sergio Pablos\u2019 2019 animated Netflix film was basically an origin story for Santa Claus by way of a desperate postman stationed in a remote northern village. Further proof, along with \u201cMiracle on 34th Street,\u201d that the best Christmas movies hinge on the postal service. (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas\u201d (2021): Clocking in at only 30 minutes, this is the perfect film for the littlest ones in the house. It\u2019s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d: Robert Benton\u2019s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It\u2019s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That\u2019s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cCarol\u201d (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn\u2019t catch Cate Blanchett\u2019s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cCarol\u201d would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, \u201cCarol\u201d is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d (1945): You don\u2019t have to watch it on TCM but it\u2019s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it\u2019s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of \u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d \u2013 that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn\u2019t that fun \u2013 has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cLittle Women\u201d (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cLittle Women\u201d just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth\u2019s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig\u2019s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) \u2014 Bahr",
      "\u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there\u2019s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn't shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says \u201cMr. Matuschek.\u201d (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d (1947): It\u2019s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton\u2019s \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It\u2019s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O\u2019Hara\u2019s single working mom, Natalie Wood\u2019s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it\u2019s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day.

      "SEATAC, Washington -- Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports, which are hiring local musicians and carefully curating playlists to help lighten travelers\u2019 moods.",
      "London\u2019s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.",
      "Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\u201cI like it. There\u2019s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,\u201d said Grace Idiart, 9. \u201cIf their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.\u201d",
      "Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.",
      "Music isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It\u2019s minimalist and designed to calm.",
      "But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.",
      "Mood Media \u2013 formerly known as Muzak \u2013 develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who\u2019s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.",
      "\u201cWe see it as a soundscape,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cWe design for all of these moments.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a science to Mood Music\u2019s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.",
      "\u201cHow do we want to affect their mood at that moment?\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Here\u2019s a load of songs.\u2019 It\u2019s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.\u201d",
      "At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they\u2019re passing through.",
      "Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.",
      "Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cThe idea was like, \u2019Man, why doesn\u2019t Seattle have music? We\u2019re a music city too,\u201d Kuiken said.",
      "At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s anxiety levels are very high when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d Kuiken said. \u201cThe feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.\u201d",
      "The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.",
      "David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle\u2019s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he\u2019s gained new fans from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, \u2018That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cSo it feels like it\u2019s especially therapeutic for people.\u201d",
      "Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.",
      "Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that\u2019s meant to be actively listened to \u2013 like live music or catchy pop songs \u2013 can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports \u2013 especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.",
      "But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.",
      "\u201cA well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren\u2019t particularly cognizant of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just know they\u2019re having a good time and that it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",

      "Now caretaker of his dad's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run",
      "NEW YORK -- Only recently given stewardship over his late father's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.",
      "The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents' 1971 song \"Happy Christmas (War is Over\")\" and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album \u201cMind Games,\u201d originally released in 1973.",
      "\u201cIt feels overwhelming and surreal,\u201d said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono's interactive art project \u201cWish Tree.\u201d",
      "For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was murdered in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It's more than a preservation mission: On \u201cMind Games,\u201d he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon's music to create something entirely new.",
      "Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father's \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall's reissue of his dad's \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with \u201cMind Games.\u201d",
      "Besides the music, the innovative box is modeled after one of his mother's art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included \u2014 \u201cmind games,\u201d remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.",
      "Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he'd hear fans singing his father's music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. \u201cIt was pretty clear to me that wasn't happening with my friends,\u201d he said.",
      "His father's music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.",
      "\u201cI think I would have rebelled more against my dad's \u2014 and my mom's \u2014 music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause he wasn't around, I've always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.\u201d",
      "He inherited the job of keeping his father's music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.",
      "In liner notes for \u201cMind Games,\u201d Lennon explains that \u201cthe only meaningful way that I can show my love to him\u201d is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture's consciousness. That's poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?",
      "\u201cWhat else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?\u201d he said. \u201cI can't actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.\u201d",
      "That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. \u201cit was like the president was visiting,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Only after he began the \u201cMind Games\u201d project did Lennon learn that the album wasn't particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.",
      "That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called \u201cBrutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.\u201d In an unsigned review, the author said the \u201cMind Games\u201d reissue defines overkill. \u201cYou can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.\u201d",
      "That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn't really connect was because it wasn't promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.",
      "Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon's \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d album \u2014 most visibly on \u201cAisumasen (I'm Sorry),\u201d one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon's notorious \u201clost weekend\u201d separation from Ono.",
      "Different versions of the title cut also show Sean's approach. There's the original \u201cMind Games,\u201d with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That's stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of \u201cMake Love, Not War,\u201d a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.",
      "He didn't have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon's demo of \u201cI'm the Greatest,\u201d a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.",
      "In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father's.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who feel that it's taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThe way I look at it is, if I'm going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don't think it's helping, then I'm going to do that.\u201d",
      "For anyone who wants the original versions, they're readily available.",
      "\u201cIt's very forensic work,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not worried about what someone else is going to think. I'm just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else's music.\u201d",
      "As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described \u201cIntuition\u201d as a good song where he didn't nail the lyrics. The \u201cGet Back\u201d film of recording sessions for the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album showed the Beatles as humans who didn't hand songs down from Mount Olympus.",
      "Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the \u201cOne to One\u201d concerts involving his father and a reissue of the \u201cWalls and Bridges\u201d album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album, \u201cAsterisms,\u201d this year.",
      "Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn't want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn't hold back anymore. \u201cNow I'm too old to care,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn't get into music because I had some great talent or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z\u2019s lawyers asked a judge Wednesday to speedily extract the rapper from a lawsuit in which a woman alleges she was sexually assaulted by Jay-Z and Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs when she was 13.",
      "The unidentified woman recently added Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, to her lawsuit against Combs in Manhattan federal court, alleging that she was attacked by the singers in 2000 after Combs\u2019 limo driver offered her a ride to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "In their court filing Wednesday, Jay-Z's lawyers cited a recent television interview in which the woman acknowledged inconsistencies in her story.",
      "The filing came before Combs appeared for a pretrial hearing in his criminal case. After lawyers discussed evidentiary deadlines, prosecutors told Judge Arun Subramanian that any new charges against the hip-hop mogul before a May trial would require minimal new evidence to be shared among lawyers.",
      "In the criminal case, Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that the Bad Boy Records founder coerced and abused women for years with help from associates and employees. Combs, who has been jailed without bail for three months, hugged his lawyers and touched his heart as he acknowledged his children among spectators.",
      "In the civil case, one of several filed against him, the woman originally asserted that she was raped by Combs at the after-party but did not mention Jay-Z.",
      "Last Friday, NBC aired an interview in which she said she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault. NBC also reported that a representative of the Maddens said they were touring the Midwest during the VMAs, and her father said he does not recall what would have been a drive home of more than five hours.",
      "Jay-Z has said the article proves that Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame. Attorney Teny R. Geragos, representing Combs, has said the TV interview was a part of the \u201cbeginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "In the newly filed court papers, Jay-Z's lawyers wrote that the allegations \u201chave caused incalculable harm to Mr. Carter, his family, his businesses, his employees, and his legacy.\u201d",
      "Buzzbee told The Associated Press via email that the plaintiffs' lawyers planned to respond in court to the latest filing.",
      "\u201cThey continue to file meritless motions that are contrary to the rules and which have absolutely no merit,\u201d Buzzbee said.",
      "Buzbee announced in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs gained fame in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d"

      "A popular social media influencer has issued an apology after a Swedish tabloid published a report saying she created a \u201cwork environment filled with fear and psychological pressure\u201d at her fashion brand, Djerf Avenue.",
      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",
      "The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and \u201cher favorites.\u201d One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jacob Elordi is suddenly everywhere in Hollywood \u2014 so much so that he thinks he must be dreaming.",
      "Amid a remarkable streak of high-profile projects with respected filmmakers \u2014 Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla,\u201d Guillermo del Toro's upcoming adaptation of \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and, in theaters now, Paul Schrader's \u201cOh, Canada\u201d \u2014 the 27-year-old isn\u2019t taking his success for granted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be so arrogant as to say like, you know, \u2018I choose what is befitting of me,\u2019\u201d he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful because to say you choose these things sort of seems too conscious or something. I kind of am in a constant state of like, \u2018Wake me up from this.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, Canada\u201d tells the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), an acclaimed documentarian on his deathbed who, in what becomes a final act of confession, agrees to have the cameras turned toward him for a documentary about his own life.",
      "Elordi plays a young Fife in the film, based on Russell Banks\u2019 2021 novel, \u201cForegone.\u201d Despite their physical differences, Elordi\u2019s performance as a younger Gere is believable, thanks in part to the amount of effort he put into studying Gere\u2019s mannerisms.",
      "\u201cRichard has such a rich career of films and a really diverse range of films so there was a lot to watch and just kind of copy him, you know? Like Simon Says or something,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cThe best one for physicality was \u2018American Gigolo,\u2019 because I think he was 29 or something when he made that film. So, it\u2019s, you know, not far from where I am now.\u201d",
      "Schrader is not known for making big-budget blockbusters. And while the filmmaker has reaped critical praise throughout his prolific career, he\u2019s made his share of panned flops.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the 78-year-old from cementing his reputation as a pioneering auteur with an impressive catalog of actors who admire and work with him, including Amanda Seyfried,Willem Dafoe,Oscar Isaac and Nicolas Cage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a list of people who have sort of given to the art form of cinema and he\u2019s right up at the top of it,\u201d Elordi said. \u201cAs soon as the email comes through and it says Paul Schrader, you go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite that kind of reputation, Schrader is not one to break box office records. As he has looked back on his career, he\u2019s been frank about not prioritizing the immediate financial success of the dozens of films he\u2019s made.",
      "\u201cTo me, shelf life is more valuable than the box office,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that much from opening weekend.\u201d",
      "Instead, he evaluates a different set of criteria when determining how he feels about a film in his archive: \u201cIf I get it made, that\u2019s the first level of success. If it\u2019s taken seriously, that\u2019s the second level of success. And if it actually works with audiences, that\u2019s the third.\u201d",
      "While his films aren\u2019t necessarily avant-garde or experimental, Schrader makes the kinds of movies talked about more among film buffs than mass audiences. His 2017 \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d for example, will not satiate those who crave closure or clear-cut endings. And \u201cOh, Canada\u201d is not exactly action-packed.",
      "But Elordi rejects the notion that Schrader\u2019s movies aren\u2019t accessible to a wide audience.",
      "\u201cThat kind of gives you like this elitist feel, you know? I hate that cinema conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a language in cinema that doesn\u2019t really take a long time to learn if you are sort of watching healthy things.\u201d",
      "Still, Elordi acknowledged certain movies require patience and a willingness to sit with ambiguity.",
      "\u201cMy mom says stuff like that to me all the time. She\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, but the movie can\u2019t just end. Like, I need to know about this, this and this.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No, no, the movie can just end, and you can go away and think about it,\u2019\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Don\u2019t go looking in Wikipedia for architect L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th",
      "\u201cThe making of a good building,\u201d observed architect Frank Lloyd Wright, \u201cis a great moral performance.\u201d",
      "Like many notable quotes about architecture, it speaks to grandeur, permanence, scale. One imagines L\u00e1zl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, the visionary Hungarian architect who escaped the Holocaust and sailed to the United States to find his American Dream, would heartily agree.",
      "But don\u2019t go looking on Wikipedia. T\u00f3th, played with deep soul and unrelenting intensity by Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d is actually fictional, though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, so richly realized is his story in director Brady Corbet\u2019s audacious new film. Though not for everyone, it's a film that can justifiably be described as \u201cepic\u201d in ambition and design. And, wouldn't you know, ambition and design are precisely what the movie\u2019s about.",
      "Of course, that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which takes its name from the raw style of architecture that T\u00f3th creates, is also about the incalculable trauma that followed World War II. It\u2019s about the immigrant experience, and it\u2019s about what happens when the American Dream beckons, then fails. It also explores a different dream: the artist\u2019s dream, and what happens when it meets opposing forces, be they geographic displacement or cold economic calculus.",
      "Not to mix our arts metaphors, but it\u2019s fair to say a story like this needs a pretty big canvas. Corbet, working with co-writer Mona Fastvold, definitely gives himself that, shooting in VistaVision, with its expansive field of view; dividing his film into movements like a symphony; and finally, allowing himself a whopping three hours and 35 minutes, including a built-in intermission. The parallels with architecture here seem clear. Make a building, or make a movie \u2014 but if you\u2019re thinking small, go home.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d spans 30 years in the life of T\u00f3th, whom we first meet in a terrific sequence, darting through darkness. It soon emerges these are the chaotic alleys of an immigrant ship. He\u2019s been left with nothing, but still lucky: unlike more than half of fellow Hungarian Jews, he's survived the Holocaust. His first view of the United States is the Statue of Liberty towering above the deck \u2014 filmed upside down, a choice we\u2019ll understand better later.",
      "T\u00f3th heads to Philadelphia, where he\u2019s greeted by cousin Attila (Alessandro Nivola), who'll let him work at his furniture store. Attila also bears monumental news: L\u00e1zl\u00f3's beloved wife, Erzs\u00e9bet (Felicity Jones) has survived her own ordeal in the camps, and is alive in Europe. (Just watching Brody receive this news is a vision hard to shake \u2014 the actor, himself the son of a Hungarian refugee, is doing his best work here since his Oscar-winning performance in \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d)",
      "A fortunate break comes when Harry Lee Van Buren (Joe Alwyn), the haughty, aristocratic son of industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, comes looking for help renovating a library for his father. The perfectionist T\u00f3th begins creating a modernist gem, with daylight shining from above onto a single elegant reading chair and lamp (at moments, this movie's a great advertisement for architecture school).",
      "But then Dad himself \u2014 an impeccably clad, impossibly dapper yet explosive and ultimately monstrous character played to the hilt by Guy Pearce \u2014 shows up too early, infuriated that his library's been torn up. He expels the cousins and they don\u2019t get paid. T\u00f3th ends up in a church shelter, shoveling coal by day.",
      "But the elder Van Buren comes to see his error, especially when the press picks up on his library. Soon, T\u00f3th is dining with the wealthy at Van Buren\u2019s palatial Doylestown estate, and learning that Van Buren has tapped him to build a vast community center atop a hill to honor his mother.",
      "The film\u2019s second part opens with Erzs\u00e9bet arriving in America, along with T\u00f3th's niece Zs\u00f3fia (Raffey Cassidy). Erzs\u00e9bet, given a sensitive, intelligent portrayal by Jones, is suffering deeply from the physical effects of the war. She also quickly sees the darker side of the Van Burens. But T\u00f3th is stuck, mired in a project that will take years, a living hostage to the Van Burens on their estate, fighting for every phase of the project and darned near going mad \u2014 on top of a drug addiction stemming from the war \u2014 as Van Buren demands cuts and compromises, including the height of his building.",
      "A beautiful \u2013 and horrible \u2014 sequence comes in the exquisite marble quarries of Carrara, in Italy, where T\u00f3th travels with Van Buren to choose a final piece. The beauty is in the filmmaking. The horror is in what transpires between the men \u2014 and it's arguably an uncomfortably jarring note, given how suddenly it seems to arrive out of the blue.",
      "A coda, decades later in Venice, reveals something profound about why T\u00f3th was so insistent about the measurements of his Doylestown creation. And so, yes, it takes more than three hours for us to learn the full truth about T\u00f3th's vision.",
      "Not all directors can pull off such a feat and make it worth our while. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d like its protagonist, is not without flaws or incongruities or indulgences. But it hardly seems accidental that one of the film\u2019s key lines tells us it\u2019s the destination, not the journey, that matters. Corbet went big here \u2014 really big \u2014 and it paid off.",
      "\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an A24 release, is unrated by the Motion Picture Association. Running time: 215 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Each volume features collaborations with artists across the globe. But this time, the 30-year-old also harnessed voices of the audience at his shows to create harmonies for the album. Collier often acts as a conductor at his concerts, directing different sections of the crowd to sing segments of his songs, placing microphones around the venue to record their contributions.",
      "One track on \u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d is titled \u201c100,000 Voices,\" and it quite literally features that many singers.",
      "\u201cThere's like over 100,000 people on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cOver 100 of those are established artists or members of groups like orchestras and choirs and things that I really love and respect, from every single continent of the world. But yeah, most of 100,000 voices are the audience members from tour.\u201d",
      "His inventive approach to composition has scored him three Grammy nominations for the 2025 award show, including album of the year, global music performance and best arrangement, instrumental or a cappella.",
      "He's also the first British artist to win a Grammy for each of his first four albums. Not bad for an artist that began his career posting on YouTube, later to become mentored by the late-great producer Quincy Jones and release a number of critically acclaimed records.",
      "Still, Collier can't believe he's once again up for album of the year, the show's top prize. (\u201cDjesse Vol. 3\u201d was nominated in 2021 but lost to Taylor Swift's \u201cfolklore.\u201d) In 2025, the other nominees include Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Billie Eilish.",
      "\u201cIt's thrilling and wild,\u201d he says of the honor.",
      "\u201cThe album is in some ways like a celebration of the human voice,\u201d he says of \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m almost more proud of what that means philosophically than I am for, like, these specific songs on the record be recognized (for awards). But it\u2019s a really thrilling predicament.\u201d",
      "Collier believes that everyone can sing and considers himself to be \u201ca leader of a choir,\u201d in his audience improvisations and onstage collaborators. \u201cI really try to make space for all these different kinds of people to just feel welcome,\" he says. \"And if they can feel welcome, then they\u2019re a part of the music.\u201d",
      "\u201cDjesse Vol. 4\u201d contains collaborations with artists across genres, including Brandi Carlile, Camilo, aespa, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, John Legend, Tori Kelly and Coldplay's Chris Martin.",
      "But now that Collier has completed the \u201cDjesse\u201d series, what's next?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a clear idea of exactly what\u2019s coming next, which I love, actually. Sometimes in life you need those moments of question marks,\" he says.",

Soon, Martha\u2019s cancer worsens and she asks Ingrid to assist her in self-euthanasia. \u201cThe cancer can\u2019t get me if I get the cancer first,\u201d she says.",
      "Why not ask someone she\u2019s closer with? Well, she has, Martha says, but for various reasons none of them are willing. With an illegal pill bought from, as she says, \u201cthe dark web\u201d and a slight conspiratorial vibe that they\u2019re committing a crime together, they travel to a modernist house in upstate New York where Martha plans to end her life. She'll be comforted, she believes, having Ingrid just down the hall. Martha doesn't want any fuss, just a nice time. \u201cAs if we were on vacation,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d the title of which plays off Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d is about finding dignity and contentment with death as a natural part of life, and, perhaps, the mystery of the relationships that end up mattering the most. The one thing Martha and Ingrid share is a former lover (played by John Turturro ), who turns up again in clandestine meetings with Ingrid. He\u2019s preoccupied with environmental disaster and the death of the planet, but fondly recalls sleeping with Martha as \u201clike having sex with a terrorist \u2013 it always felt like the last time.\u201d",
      "No one besides Almod\u00f3var can get away with lines like this, in any language. A less fevered austerity has crept into some of his fine late-period movies (particularly \u201cPain and Glory\u201d but also \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d ), but within them still beats a passionate, melodramatic heart. Death is everywhere in \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own.\" The movie is very much in dialogue with other works like James Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead.\" (They watch John Huston's 1987 adaptation one night.) But it\u2019s not an especially dour film, and you sense, in it\u2019s boldly colorful designs and lush storytelling that Almod\u00f3var is as concerned with life as he is with death.",
      "\u201cI still think sex is the best way to fend off looming thoughts of death,\u201d Martha tells Ingrid.",
      "Not all of this works, even if every bit of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d feels conjured \u2014 as is typical of Almod\u00f3var's thickly layered films \u2014 from a fully fleshed-out emotional terrain. (Here, he adapts Sigrid Nunez\u2019s 2020 American novel, \u201cWhat Are You Going Through.\") There's an awkward and overdone flashback early in the film when Martha recalls her painful history with the father to her estranged daughter. Some of the dialogue can sound stilted.",
      "But what absolutely, undoubtedly does work is Moore and Swinton together. If some of the more melodramatic or crime-movie flourishes feel forced, the central relationship of \u201cThe Room Next Door\u201d is consistently provocative. Swinton, in particular, is extraordinarily deft at finding Martha's singular equilibrium: on the brink of death but still alive to so much \u2014 books, movies, the conversation of a friend. Death is coming, so best to spend what's left in good company.",
      "\u201cThe Room Next Door,\" a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for thematic content, strong language and some sexual reference. Running time: 110 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "No one was expecting it",
      "NEW YORK -- No one was expecting it. Late last year, Andr\u00e9 3000 released his debut solo album, \u201cNew Blue Sun,\u201d 18 years after his legendary rap group Outkast's last studio album, \u201cIdlewild.\u201d",
      "But \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has \u201cno bars,\u201d he jokes. It's a divergence from rap because \u201cthere was nothing I was liking enough to rap about, or I didn't feel it sounded fresh. I'm not about to serve you un-fresh (expletive.)\u201d",
      "Instead, he offered up a six-track instrumental album of ambient alt-jazz \u2014 with special attention paid to the flute.",
      "\u201cThe sound, that's how I got into it,\u201d he says of the instrument. \u201cThe portability, too. You can't tote around a piano and play in Starbucks.\"",
      "He's also invested in the flute's history \u2014 like learning about Mayan flutes made from clay, a design he had re-created in cedarwood. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of fables and, you know, indigenous stories that go along with playing the flute \u2014 playing like the birds or playing your heart like the wind \u2014 it kind of met (me) where I was in life,\" he says.",
      "\u201cFlutes \u2014 wind instruments in general \u2014 are the closest thing you get to actually hearing a human,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou're actually hearing the breath of a person.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a stunning collection, one that has earned Andr\u00e9 3000 three new Grammy Award nominations: album of the year, alternative jazz, and instrumental composition. Those arrive exactly 25 years after the 1999 Grammys, where Outkast received their first nomination \u2014 for \u201cRosa Parks,\u201d from their third album, \u201cAquemini\" \u2014 and 20 years after the group won album of the year for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt matters because we all want to be acknowledged or recognized,\u201d Andr\u00e9 3000 says of his new Grammy nominations. \u201cIt's a type of proof of connection, in some type of way ... especially with the Grammys, because it's voted on by a committee of musicians and people in the industry.\u201d",
      "He's a bit surprised by the attention, too, given the type of album he created. \u201cWe have no singles on the radio, not even singles that are hot in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you're sitting next to Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, these are highly, hugely popular music artists, I'm satisfied just because of that ... we won just to be a part of the whole conversation.\"",
      "He theorizes that it may be because popular music listening habits are broadening. \u201cA lot of artists are just trying different things. Even, you know, the album that Beyonc\u00e9 is nominated for, it\u2019s not her normal thing,\u201d he says of her country-and-then-some record, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in this place where things are kind of shifting and moving.\"",
      "For Andr\u00e9 3000, \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d has allowed him to \u201cfeel like a whole new artist,\u201d but it is also an extension of who he's always been. \u201cBeing on the road with Outkast and picking up a bass clarinet at a pawn shop in New York and just sitting on the back of the bus playing with it \u2014 these things have been around,\u201d he says.",
      "He's also always embraced \u201cnewness,\u201d as he puts it, experimenting creatively \u201ceven if it sounds non-masterful.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven producing for Outkast, I was just learning these instruments. If I ... put my hands down and play \u2018Ms. Jackson,\u2019 I'm not knowing what I'm playing. But I like it,\u201d he says.",
      "As for a new Outkast album, \u201cI never say never,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can say that the older I get, I feel like that time has happened.\u201d",

Eight years later, she received international acclaim for \u201cThe Inheritance of Loss,\u201d released in the U.S. by Atlantic Monthly Press. Winner of the Booker and the National Book Critics Circle award, her novel follows the lives of an undocumented Indian immigrant in the U.S. and of an Anglicized Indian overseas in the state of West Bengal. Desai was 35 when she received the Booker, the youngest woman at the time to win the prize.",

      "The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.",

      "The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, so Goldspring only had to decide on the balance of probabilities whether the Tates had evaded tax.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Megan Thee Stallion asked a court on Tuesday to issue a restraining order against Tory Lanez, who she says is harassing her from prison through surrogates as he serves a 10-year sentence for shooting her in the feet.",
      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\u201cEven now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\u201d the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "The petition says prison call logs from Lanez at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi show that he is coordinating attacks on Megan's credibility.",
      "An email seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing.",
      "The petition says the protective order issued to prevent the previous harassment is no longer in effect, which it calls a loophole and flaw in the criminal justice system.",
      "In December 2022, Lanez was convicted of three felonies: assault with a semiautomatic firearm; having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence.",
      "A judge rejected a motion for a new trial from Lanez's lawyers, who are appealing his conviction.",
      "In August of last year, he received the 10-year sentence, bringing what seemed to be a conclusion to a three-year legal and cultural saga that saw two careers, and lives, thrown into turmoil.",
      "The petition says that one blogger in particular, Elizabeth Milagro Cooper, whom Megan is suing in a separate lawsuit, is acting as Lanez \u201cpuppet and mouthpiece.\u201d She alleges Cooper is spreading falsehoods on social media and YouTube, saying in one video posted to X, \u201cCan you even prove she was shot?\" and calling her a \u201cprofessional victim\u201d in another post.",
      "Cooper's attorney Michael Pancier declined comment on the California petition, and said in an email that their forthcoming response to the separate federal lawsuit against her will speak for itself.",
      "A previous motion to dismiss Megan's lawsuit said it makes \u201cdubious legal claims\u201d and \u201cirrelevant and impertinent allegations.\u201d",
      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",
      "Megan Thee Stallion, now 29, was already a major rising star at the time of the shooting, and her music\u2019s popularity has soared since. She won a Grammy for best new artist in 2021, and she had No. 1 singles with \u201cSavage,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9, and as a guest on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cWAP.\u201d",
      "Lanez, 32, began releasing mixtapes in 2009 and saw a steady rise in popularity, moving on to major label albums. His last two reached the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s charts."

    "story": [
      "A judge has ruled that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A judge ruled Friday that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment, though Planned Parenthood said the decision is still not sufficient for it to resume providing abortions in the state.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion ban \u201cis directly at odds\u201d with a constitutional amendment creating a right to abortion that won voter approval in the November election. The judge also blocked the state from enforcing numerous other abortion restrictions, including a 72-hour waiting period and an informed consent law that required patients to be given certain state-mandated information before receiving an abortion.",
      "But the judge declined to block several other contested abortion laws, including one requiring abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities cannot comply with some of the licensing requirements, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "\u201cWhile Planned Parenthood stands ready to start providing abortions in Missouri again as soon as the Court permits, the abortion restrictions remaining in effect \u2014 including Missouri\u2019s medically unnecessary and discriminatory clinic licensing requirement \u2013 make this impossible,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. The Missouri amendment did not specifically override any laws. Instead, advocates had to ask a court to knock down specific laws that they believe are now unconstitutional.",
      "Zhang\u2019s injunction is preliminary, but it signals that the judge is likely to ultimately find the abortion ban unconstitutional as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "Missouri had been among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, a Republican and abortion opponent, previously issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions would be legal when the amendment took effect.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Zhang declined to block several contested Missouri abortion laws, including the licensure law, another limiting only physicians to performing abortions and still another requiring in-person appointments before abortions.",
      "Among the laws blocked by Friday's order was one prohibiting abortions solely because of a diagnosis indicating Down Syndrome. Also blocked was a telemedicine ban that requires a physician to be physically present in the room while a patient takes an abortion-causing medication. And the judge barred enforcement of another law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is performed.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy."

      "A Texas man facing execution did not appear at the state Capitol after two failed attempts by lawmakers to issue a subpoena for his testimony",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A second attempt by Texas lawmakers to bring a man on death row to the state Capitol over doubts that he killed his 2-year-old daughter failed again Friday, dimming the likelihood of Robert Roberson testifying publicly after a last-minute subpoena halted his execution.",
      "Roberson, who had been scheduled to be die by lethal injection in October, would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that medical experts have questioned.",
      "The latest unsuccessful effort to have Roberson testify comes after Texas' attorney general asked a court to block a second legislative subpoena issued by lawmakers, who are running out of time until the Legislature reconvenes in January and the subpoena expires.",
      "\u201cWe have been attempting to fight accommodation since October, and they have never responded to anything meaningfully because they don\u2019t want to have Robert here,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to halt Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of killing his daughter in 2003. Prosecutors argued that he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what's called shaken baby syndrome.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and medical experts have expressed doubts over the shaken baby diagnosis used to convict Roberson and say his daughter likely died from symptoms of severe pneumonia.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has staunchly defended Roberson\u2019s conviction and said the science around shaken baby syndrome has not changed enough to absolve his guilt.",
      "In the court order, Paxton\u2019s office said that \u201cit is not the role of the Legislature to adjudicate offenses\u201d and that lawmakers overstepped their power when they halted his execution.",
      "The Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence issued their first subpoena for Roberson to testify one day before his scheduled execution \u2014 an unprecedent legal maneuver that successfully staved off his execution.",
      "A new execution date has not been set.",
      "Texas has a \u201cjunk science law\u201d that allows people wrongfully convicted on dubious science to have their sentences overturned. The House committee said they wanted Roberson to testify about this law and how they believe it has not worked as intended for his case. Criminal justice advocates say the state's highest criminal court has deliberately misinterpreted the law.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it cannot be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has maintained that Roberson was rightfully convicted. The Texas Board of Pardons and Parole voted unanimously to not recommend him clemency in October.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, according to an annual county report released Friday that officials described as showing the peak of the fentanyl crisis in the area.",
      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. flu season is underway, with cases surging across much of the country, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits.",
      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Specialty pharmacies and online companies that have been selling off-brand copies of two blockbuster drugs for obesity and diabetes will need to phase out their versions next year under a federal decision issued Thursday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said that a nationwide shortage of Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound and Mounjaro has been resolved, eliminating the need for copycat versions of the drugs that have become wildly popular with Americans trying to lose weight.",
      "The decision is a win for Lilly \u2014 which had been pressing the FDA to take the step for months \u2014 and is expected to impact how patients access the drugs, including how much they pay.",
      "Zepbound is FDA-approved to treat obesity and Mounjaro is approved for diabetes. They use the same active ingredient, tirzepatide.",
      "The FDA said Thursday that \u201cLilly\u2019s supply is currently meeting or exceeding demand,\u201d after two years of shortages.",
      "Both drugs are part of the GLP-1 class that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness. Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 competing drugs from Novo Nordisk \u2014 remain on the FDA\u2019s shortage list.",
      "With demand for GLP-1 drugs booming, compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies like Hims and Ro have jumped into the market, selling cheaper versions online. People can usually get a month's supply for several hundred dollars.",
      "Thursday\u2019s decision gives businesses between 60 and 90 days, depending on their size, to phase out their products.",
      "The FDA permits compounded versions of brand name drugs when they are in shortage, and the shift back to Lilly\u2019s medications could improve safety for consumers. The FDA warned patients last year about problems with the ingredients and formulations of some GLP-1 drugs sold online. The agency has limited oversight of compounding pharmacies, which are primarily overseen by state authorities.",
      "Compounding pharmacies use raw drug ingredients to produce customized versions of prescription medications \u2014 for instance, when patients have allergies to certain ingredients. The industry has grown into a multibillion-dollar business over the past decade amid increasing drug shortages.",
      "Demand for off-brand GLP-1 drugs has been amplified by aggressive online promotions from telehealth companies, which aren\u2019t subject to the same marketing rules as drugmakers.",

      "Packaged foods in the U.S. will have to follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy,\u201d according to changes finalized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",
      "The change banishes foods such as sugary cereals, highly sweetened yogurts, white bread and some granola bars from bearing a \u201chealthy\u201d label, while allowing foods such as avocados, olive oil, salmon, eggs and some trail mix to use it. Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",
      "\u201cIt's critical for the future of the country that food be a vehicle for wellness,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. \u201cImproving access to nutrition information is an important public health effort the FDA can undertake to help people build healthy eating patterns.\u201d",
      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",

      "\u201cBig picture, this is a huge improvement from a 30-year-old outdated definition based on 40-year-old science,\u201d he said.",
      "The new rule acknowledges that dietary and nutrition knowledge has progressed over three decades and that the previous definition didn\u2019t jibe with dietary guidelines that are the cornerstone of federal programs and policies.",
      "Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group, said that the new rule \u201cstands to exclude some packaged foods, despite countless years of industry innovation to provider healthier options.\u201d",

      "That raises new questions about the virus, which has spread for years in wild birds, commercial poultry and many mammal species.",
      "The virus, also known as Type A H5N1, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cattle in March. Since then, bird flu has been confirmed in at least 866 herds in 16 states.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation's first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said this week.",

      "Importantly, there are no reports of person-to-person transmission and no signs that the virus has changed to spread more easily among humans.",
      "In general, flu experts agreed with that assessment, saying it\u2019s too soon to tell what trajectory the outbreak could take.",
      "\u201cThe entirely unsatisfactory answer is going to be: I don\u2019t think we know yet,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",

      "This week, health officials confirmed the first known case of severe illness in the U.S. All previous the previous U.S. cases \u2014 there have been about 60 \u2014 were generally mild.",
      "The patient in Louisiana, who is older than 65 and had underlying medical problems, is in critical condition. Few details have been released, but officials said the person developed severe respiratory symptoms after exposure to a backyard flock of sick birds.",
      "That makes it the first confirmed U.S. infection tied to backyard birds, the CDC said.",
      "Tests showed that the strain that caused the person's illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.",
      "Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "It's possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cI assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said.",
      "\u201cIf birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should very careful about how they handle those animals,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a public health disease expert at the University of Minnesota.",
      "The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu \u2014 and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.",
      "In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products.",
      "In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats.",
      "Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.",

      "The Justice Department has unsealed a civil complaint alleging CVS Pharmacy Inc. and various subsidiaries filled unlawful prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act",
      "The Justice Department unsealed a civil complaint Wednesday alleging CVS Pharmacy Inc. and various subsidiaries filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act.",
      "The complaint also says CVS sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for such prescriptions in violation of the False Claims Act. CVS is the largest pharmacy chain in the U.S., where there are more than 9,000 pharmacies.",
      "A representative of CVS said the company has cooperated with the DOJ\u2019s investigation for more than four years, and strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d within the complaint.",
      "Among the unlawful prescriptions that CVS allegedly filled from Oct. 17, 2013, to the present were for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, early fills of opioids, and \u201ctrinity\u201d prescriptions \u2014 a dangerous combination of drugs made up of an opioid, a benzodiazepine and a muscle relaxant, according to prosecutors.",
      "CVS also allegedly filled large quantities of prescriptions for controlled substances written by prescribers it knew to be engaged in \u201cpill mill practices\u201d \u2014 that is, prescribers who issue large numbers of controlled substance prescriptions without any medical purpose, investigators said.",
      "According to the complaint, CVS ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources, including its own pharmacists and internal data, indicating that its stores were dispensing such prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit alleges that CVS failed to exercise its critical role as gatekeeper of dangerous prescription opioids and, instead, facilitated the illegal proliferation of these highly addictive drugs, including by pill mill prescribers,\" U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha for the District of Rhode Island said in a press release.",
      "If CVS is found liable, it could face civil penalties for each unlawful prescription filled and treble damages and other penalties for each prescription reimbursed by federal health care programs.",
      "The company said it's cooperated with investigators.",
      "\u201cWe will defend ourselves vigorously against this misguided federal lawsuit, which follows on the heels of years of litigation over these issues by state and local governments \u2014 claims that already have been largely resolved by a global agreement with the participating state Attorneys General,\u201d said Amy Thibault, director of external communications for CVS in a written statement.",
      "Each of the prescriptions in question was for an FDA-approved opioid medication prescribed by a practitioner who the government itself licensed, authorized and empowered to write controlled-substance prescriptions, Thibault added.",
      "The filing of the complaint follows the announcement on Friday that the McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin.",
      "It\u2019s the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold companies accountable that officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of these deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis."

    "summary": "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
    "story": [
      "Arizona's governor wants to repeal the state law requiring an annual abortion report",
      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is calling for legislators to repeal the state law that requires an annual abortion report, saying that it infringes on patients' privacy, which echoes other Democratic officials' push to reduce or eliminate such requirements.",
      "\u201cThe government has no place in surveilling Arizonans\u2019 medical decision-making or tracking their health history,\u201d Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the Legislature, said in a statement Wednesday as the state released its report covering 2023. \u201cStarting a family is a sensitive and personal experience for a woman and her loved ones; there should be no room for government surveillance and publication of that decision.\u201d",
      "Hobbs is not the only one concerned about the collection of abortion data, especially as Donald Trump prepares to take over as president again, when he could implement policies that are hostile, or at least less favorable, to abortion rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really worth thinking carefully about the risk and the benefit of collecting data in this new environment,\u201d said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a researcher at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights and does its own voluntary surveys of abortion providers.",
      "A handful of Democratic-controlled states have reduced reporting requirements in recent years out of concern about privacy and also considering the burden it puts on providers to collect it all. Republican-run states generally ask for a lot, though many of them have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy or after roughly the first six weeks, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "Michigan just released 2023 abortion data but is not collecting it at all going forward. Illinois has switched to aggregate reporting instead of requiring providers to send information about each individual abortion. Minnesota has reduced the number of questions they require to be tallied, eliminating data on marital status, race and ethnicity, among others.",
      "New York City has also cut back on asking the patient demographics questions.",
      "Abortion access has been shifting around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Starting in the months before the Supreme Court ruling was released, the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion rights, launched regular surveys of abortion providers about their work and has generally released the results quarterly. One of the lead researchers, University of California, San Francisco, public health social scientist Ushma Upadhyay, said the next report won't come out as soon as it otherwise might have.",
      "\u201cWe are delaying our next release to give providers time to adjust to the tenor of the new administration,\u201d she said, noting that she hopes providers continue to participate in the survey.",
      "Over the past two years, the report has shown that while abortions have become rare in the states where bans are in place, they've increased slightly overall as people travel for procedures or obtain pills via telemedicine.",
      "Arizona's policy changes have been more turbulent than most. Providers stopped offering abortions in 2022 amid legal questions about whether an 1864 ban on nearly all abortions was valid, then resumed them. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court ruled that the old law could be enforced, but then put the start of enforcement on hold. Before it took effect, the state \u2014 aided by some GOP lawmakers joining Democrats \u2014 repealed the old law. And in November, voters added a right to abortion to the state constitution.",
      "The Arizona data made public on Wednesday reflects the policy changes \u2014 with the state going from just under 14,000 abortions in 2021 to 11,400 in 2022 to 12,700 last year. The 2024 numbers are not in the state's report, which is published by the Department of Health Services.",
      "The report began with voluntary participation from licensed providers in 1976 and became mandatory in 2010. The state collects detailed information, including whether minors have parental consent, as well as the age, marital status, and race and ethnicity of the patient. It also reports how many previous abortions and live births the patient has had, how far along in pregnancy she was, and whether the abortion involved a procedure or pills. But the data does not include the patient's name, address, birthdate or Social Security number.",
      "For years, four states with generally expansive abortion rights laws have skipped participating in the federal government's roundup of state data. California and Maryland don't collect the data. New Hampshire and New Jersey make it voluntary for hospitals and other providers to supply it.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an abortion law scholar, said states don't need to know personal information such as the name and address of people who receive abortions. And while it's useful to report basic information about abortion, she said, there are risks for abortion rights advocates, particularly in the reports from states with bans where the data mostly shows how often abortions are provided through exceptions.",
      "\u201cThe tension we find ourselves in is patient privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the looming allegation that exceptions are being misused.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving",
      "MacKenzie Scott continues to make medical debt relief a priority in her mysterious giving.",
      "This week, Undue Medical Debt, formerly RIP Medical Debt, announced it had received a rare third gift \u2014 $50 million \u2014 from the billionaire philanthropist, signaling her satisfaction with the group\u2019s efforts to purchase medical debt in bulk from hospitals and debt collectors. Scott has donated a total of $130 million to the organization since 2020.",
      "Medical debt is increasing despite most of the U.S. population having some form of medical insurance. Nearly 100 million people are unable to pay their medical bills, according to Third Way, a left-leaning national think tank.",
      "Overall, Americans owe about $220 billion in medical debt, with historically disadvantaged groups shouldering the bulk of the burden. Lower-income people, people with disabilities, middle-aged adults, Black people, the uninsured, and people living in rural areas are among the groups most likely to be affected by medical debt, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",
      "Undue Medical Debt buys debt at a discounted price, estimating that it erases about $100 in debt for each $1 donated. The group also collaborates with policymakers to encourage the adoption of measures to curb what people owe for medical care. Scott first gave Undue Medical Debt a $50 million donation in 2020, followed by a $30 million donation in 2022.",
      "With that money, the group has relieved nearly $15 billion in debt for more than 9 million people, CEO Allison Sesso said. That\u2019s a significant leap from the $1 billion in debt relieved from 2014 to 2019, she noted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m frankly astounded by this most recent gift from MacKenzie Scott and feel proud to be a steward of these funds as we continue the essential work of dismantling the yoke of medical debt that\u2019s burdening far too many families in this country,\u201d said Sesso.",
      "The continued funding has allowed Sesso \u201cto not have to worry about my next dollar,\u201d she said, and \u201cthink more strategically about the narrative around medical debt \u2014 she has helped us push that conversation.\u201d",
      "Undue Medical Debt was started in 2014 by two former debt collection executives, Jerry Ashton and Craig Antico, who were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement\u2019s advocacy for debt relief. Growth initially was slow. But with Scott\u2019s gifts, the nonprofit has been able to staff up, produce more research, and develop relationships with policymakers who have pushed for changes to hospital billing practices to relieve debt and prevent people from accumulating it in the first place, Sesso said.",
      "Undue Medical Debt\u2019s public policy arm has worked with lawmakers in North Carolina, which in July became the first state to offer additional Medicaid payments to hospitals that agree to adopt debt relief measures, she said. The policy change followed the publication of a 2023 report from Duke University, which found that one in five families in the state had been forced into collections proceedings because of medical debt.",
      "Since 2020, the organization\u2019s staff has grown from three to about 40, Sesso said. Those hires included an anthropologist who collects stories from people set back by medical debt to inform the group\u2019s research and advocacy work. Scott\u2019s gifts also have helped improve Undue Medical Debt\u2019s technology to identify people eligible for debt relief and to find hospitals from which it can purchase medical debt, among other things, Sesso said.",
      "\u201cThis coming year, because of this MacKenzie Scott grant, we\u2019ll be able to add more people, making sure that we can support that growth on an ongoing basis,\u201d Sesso said.",
      "Few organizations have received more than one gift from Scott. Other multi-grant recipients include Blue Meridian, an intermediary group that has directed billions of dollars to nonprofits around the world, and GiveDirectly, which provides no-strings-attached cash payments to low-income people globally. GiveDirectly has received $125 million from Scott since 2020. Blue Meridian has not disclosed amounts for the four gifts it\u2019s received since 2019.",
      "Scott\u2019s contributions to those two organizations were for specific causes like GiveDirectly\u2019s U.S. poverty relief fund, said Christina Im, a senior research analyst at the Center for Effective Philanthropy. In the case of Undue Medical Debt, the timing of Scott\u2019s first gifts in 2020 and 2022 seemed to correspond with COVID-relief efforts, she said.",
      "Scott, the former wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth an estimated $32 billion but provides few details about her grantmaking decisions. Without further information, it\u2019s hard to know what prompted this third donation to Undue Medical Debt, but Scott has said in public statements that she wants to help those who are most in need and bear the brunt of societal ills, said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, the Center for Effective Philanthropy\u2019s vice president for research.",
      "\u201cI have not seen a lot of other folks funding in this area,\u201d Smith Arrillaga added.",
      "Scott\u2019s latest gift to Undue Medical Debt comes amid national debates about medical insurance and the cost of medical treatments. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on December 4 in Midtown Manhattan has heightened these conversations, with some lionizing the man who allegedly committed the crime.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s no way to get change, full stop,\u201d Sesso said in reference to Thompson\u2019s murder. \u201cBut I think the anger around insurance companies and having access to care is very clear.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world. And the amount of medical debt carried by individuals seems to be increasing, noted Adam Searing, a public interest attorney and associate professor at Georgetown University, where he focuses on Medicaid and other health coverage programs.",
      "Searing previously served for 17 years as director of the Health Access Coalition at the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center, advocating for the uninsured and underinsured. During that time, he heard from people losing their homes due to liens from hospitals. Sometimes those liens could be delayed, but it still meant that the debtors couldn\u2019t pass those homes along to their children or grandchildren, he said.",
      "\u201cThose stories stuck with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really has an impact on families.\u201d",
      "Relieving debt allows people to get their lives back on track and become financially secure after a major illness or series of expensive bills, Searing said. For philanthropists, it\u2019s also a cause that is largely nonpartisan. Scott shining a spotlight on the issue is undoubtedly \u201ca good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will have a big effect.\u201d",

      "During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs",
      "WASHINGTON -- During the transition period between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, there has been at least some coordination on West Wing affairs. But not when it comes to Biden's Gender Policy Council, which has worked to defend reproductive health care in the face of growing restrictions.",
      "The first-of-its kind office was an effort to drive policy that would make life better for women and girls in the U.S. and in the world. Over the past four years, it has sought to advance reproductive freedom, make pay more equitable and increase participation by women in the workforce. It was formed through an executive order by Biden in September 2021, and members of his Cabinet have representatives on the council.",
      "It's not unusual for new presidents to remake the West Wing to suit incoming priorities, and the Trump administration hasn't said one way or the other whether the council will remain. But Project 2025, a conservative handbook written for an incoming GOP administration, has said it should be axed \u2014 in part because it promotes abortion. And Biden officials are concerned about what that might mean \u2014 particularly as reproductive health continues to worsen for some women across the nation following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "Project 2025 is a detailed, 920-page roadmap for governing, led by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. A whirlwind of hard-right ambitions, its proposals include ousting thousands of civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists and reversing the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medications used in abortions. The president-elect has claimed he has never seen it, but plenty of members of his incoming administration have written sections and many of Trump\u2019s policies align.",
      "According to the handbook, the incoming president should revoke the executive order that created the Gender Policy Council, \u201cand every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues.\u201d",
      "It mischaracterizes the office as one with a principal intent of \u201cgender affirming care\u201d and \u201csex-change\u201d surgeries on minors. The document also claims that by abolishing the office, Trump would \u201celiminate central promotion of abortion\" and \u201ccomprehensive sexuality education.\u201d",
      "It suggests, instead, that the president should spend time developing new structures dedicated to \u201cpromoting life and strengthening the family.\u201d",
      "Other presidents have carved out space for women's issues, but there has been no office within the West Wing specifically dedicated to advancing policy changes on behalf of women. Since the creation of the office, Biden has signed three executive orders and a presidential memorandum directing his administration to protect access to reproductive health, among other efforts.",
      "The council has also worked to address health disparities. Biden last year announced a women\u2019s health research initiative at wife Jill\u2019s urging that has invested nearly $1 billion. Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied.",
      "The council has also worked to lower child care payments and call for better paid leave for families.",
      "\u201cThe reality of the situation is that we\u2019ve done a huge amount that helps not only women \u2014 women and families \u2014 but really it helps our society as a whole,\" said Jen Klein, the chairwoman of the council.",
      "Klein believes that some of the work of the Gender Policy Council won\u2019t be undone. The Violence Against Women Act, for example, was reauthorized in 2022. And other issues have long been considered bipartisan. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who is Trump's nominee for secretary of state, co-sponsored the Women, Peace and Security Act of 2017, a bipartisan law signed by Trump that seeks to protect women and girls globally from violence and include women in conflict prevention.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point in American history where many of these issues were not only bipartisan, but where the business case had been made,\u201d Klein said. \u201cCare is a perfect example of that. If you think about the trajectory of the last 10 years, these are issues that are no longer seen as women\u2019s issues.\u201d",
      "But reproductive health care is much more contentious. The Gender Policy Council was formed before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned abortion rights in 2022. Since then, as states have restricted access to health care, access to abortion and other reproductive care has become a major focal point for the office.",
      "The council has spearheaded efforts throughout the administration to help safeguard access, including by working with the department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance reminding hospitals of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, a federal law that requires doctors to stabilize or treat any patient who shows up at an emergency room. Women have been turned away during miscarriages and left bleeding in parking lots in part because of abortion restrictions.",
      "Trump has waffled on abortion access particularly during his campaign. He has said that abortion limits should be left to the states, and has declined to endorse a national ban. Trump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral.",
      "Most recently, he told NBC that he was not likely to restrict access to medication abortion. \u201cI'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years, and the answer is no,\" he said. But \u201cthings do change.\u201d"

      "It's the first human case in the U.S. linked to exposure to backyard birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Since March, more than 60 bird flu infections in people have been reported in the U.S., but previous illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "CDC officials said that bird flu is still mainly an animal health issues and that the risk to the general public remains low. There has been no documented spread of the virus from person to person, said the CDC's Dr. Demetre Daskalakis.",
      "The Louisiana illness comes weeks after Canadian officials reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu. In both instances, the illnesses were caused by a strain of the virus found in wild birds, not in cattle, officials said.",
      "On a call with reporters, CDC officials did not answer a question about whether the new U.S. case and the Canada case had any similarities or differences.",
      "In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared the state of emergency as cases of the virus were detected in dairy cows on Southern California farms. Previously, the virus had been detected in state's Central Valley.",
      "\u201cThis proclamation is a targeted action to ensure government agencies have the resources and flexibility they need to respond quickly to this outbreak,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The virus has been detected in 865 dairy herds in 16 states, with nearly 650 of them in California. Raw milk from infected cattle was recalled late last month after the virus was found in samples sold in California stores.",
      "On Wednesday, Los Angeles County health officials confirmed the deaths of two cats from bird flu infections after drinking the recalled raw milk.",
      "Flu experts said the trajectory of the virus in people remains unclear, but they urged people who have contact with sick or dead birds to take precautions, including wearing respiratory and eye protection and gloves when handling poultry.",

      "Police in the United States rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after the use of force such as physical blows, restraints or Tasers",
      "Sitting alone in her car, Jen Dold was crying too hard to drive. She had just received a manila envelope with her brother\u2019s autopsy report.",
      "There it was, one devastating word: \u201caccident.\u201d The papers trembled in her hands.",
      "Their mother had called 911 for help getting Dold\u2019s 29-year-old brother, Alex, to the hospital because he was in a mental health crisis. Four sheriff\u2019s deputies and two police officers shocked him with Tasers, wrapped an arm around his neck, punched and kicked him, then left him face down until they noticed he wasn\u2019t breathing.",
      "How could that be an accident? Dold was certain it was a homicide.",
      "Angry and grieving in the parking lot outside the county medical examiner\u2019s office 30 miles north of Seattle, Dold vowed to fight.",
      "\u201cNo more silence or complacency,\u201d she thought. \u201cNo sweeping it under the rug.\u201d",
      "In the United States, police rarely face criminal charges when civilians die after officers use physical force. Whether they do can depend on a system that operates after the initial attention passes: medical examiners and coroners who decide how and why someone died \u2014 what\u2019s known as the manner and cause of death.",
      "On TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d or \u201cBones,\u201d facts and established science determine whether a death was an accident or homicide. In reality, medical investigations involving police restraint deaths can be so riddled with inconsistencies, suspect science or conflicts of interest that even extensive force may matter little, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.",
      "That investigation identified 1,036 deaths over a decade after police used not their guns but physical blows, restraints or weapons such as Tasers that aren\u2019t supposed to kill. Some people were causing little or no trouble, while others were committing violent crimes. Many died after officers broke widely known safety practices, or after medics injected them with powerful knock-out drugs, sometimes at the urging of police.",
      "Accident was the most common conclusion of medical investigations in AP\u2019s case database. Accidental rulings typically blamed preexisting conditions such as obesity or asthma, or drug use \u2014 even when in some cases blood testing did not detect lethal levels. Others faulted \u201cexcited delirium,\u201d a controversial diagnosis discredited by major medical associations. Some medical officials based their decisions not on physical evidence, but instead on whether they believed police intended to kill.",
      "Manner of death decisions are so pivotal that members of law enforcement and their allies push to shape them, with the multibillion-dollar company behind Tasers peppering medical officials with research it funded or wrote that downplays the dangers of its weapon.",
      "The degree of physical and professional separation a medical official had from local law enforcement appeared to affect rulings. Deaths were ruled accidents more frequently when medical examiners or coroners were in the same community as the department under investigation, or when they fell under the control of law enforcement.",
      "The mere location of a death has huge sway because each state designs its own system. Even within a state, county lines can matter. Death decisions are made in some places by doctors trained as forensic pathologists, in others by an elected coroner who may have no medical training and deep ties to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI call it a crazy quilt,\u201d said Dr. Victor Weedn, the former chief medical examiner of Maryland who has written about failed attempts to bring national consistency. Concerned about medical examiners\u2019 independence in police-involved deaths, he advocates for state health departments to take charge.",
      "When deaths are ruled accidental, prosecutions of officers are exceedingly rare \u2014 of the 443 cases the AP identified, just two resulted in criminal charges. A family\u2019s chances of winning a wrongful death lawsuit also become much tougher.",
      "\u201cI had a belief that the justice system was fair, that if you were a victim you\u2019d get justice, and the perpetrator would be convicted of their crime \u2014 police officer or not,\u201d Jen Dold said. \u201cSadly, we realized this was not the case.\u201d",
      "Jen Dold \u2014 11 years older than Alex \u2014 had been more like a doting mother to him growing up. When his schizophrenia began at 19, and he started to believe people were whispering and lurking outside his house, she became his primary caregiver, shuttling him around and helping him financially.",
      "One night in 2017, Alex Dold had an argument with his mother. He was in his late-20s, unemployed, living with her and off his medication. She had refused to give him more than his daily $30 from federal disability payments. So he yanked a lanyard around her neck, flipped the living room recliner where she sat, and left.",
      "The county mental health department wouldn\u2019t send someone, saying Dold wasn\u2019t violent enough.",
      "When Dold returned and sat down to watch television like nothing had happened, his mother called 911. She told the dispatcher her son was calm, yet needed hospital treatment.",
      "Two Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived. Dold acknowledged getting physical, but insisted his mother was fine and tried to close the front door.",
      "Many police are trained to calm people in mental crisis. Instead, Deputy Bryson McGee pushed inside. McGee would later say Dold punched his face, something Dold\u2019s mother, Kathy Duncan, who witnessed the interaction, denied.",
      "Four backup officers joined the fight. Over 12 minutes, the group punched, kicked and hit Dold with a baton, shocked him with Tasers, pressed a knee to his face and pushed his head down with a flashlight, according to a 990-page police report.",
      "Dold said he was submitting and cried out for his mother, who screamed that her son was mentally ill.",
      "\u201cIt was the worst yelling, shouting I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d one neighbor told an investigator.",
      "After handcuffing Dold in the driveway, deputies left him face down, a position the Justice Department and others have long warned carries a suffocation risk. No one started proper resuscitation for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Jen Dold didn\u2019t trust the investigation from the beginning. The detectives who interviewed her focused on her brother\u2019s mental illness, she thought to protect officers.",
      "Seeking an ally, she contacted Snohomish County\u2019s chief medical examiner, and was relieved when Dr. Daniel Selove told her by phone that he\u2019d weigh police force.",
      "Yet when Selove met her at his office, he explained that Dold died from an irregular heartbeat. While the Taser shocks and struggle were significant factors, Selove said, he didn\u2019t believe the officers intended to kill her brother, so his death was an accident.",
      "Whether to consider intent is a philosophical divide among forensic pathologists. Dold\u2019s death illustrates how unevenly intent can be applied \u2014 Selove used it even though under his own office\u2019s policies intent \u201cneed not be present or proven\u201d for a homicide ruling.",
      "For coroners and medical examiners, homicide doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning as murder does in criminal law. Guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners say intent is a valid consideration, but restraint deaths may be classified as homicide without it \u2014 and doing so has \u201csome value\u201d to reduce any appearance of a cover-up.",
      "Dr. J. Keith Pinckard, the organization\u2019s president, said manner of death is an opinion meant to be used for vital statistics and public health, not a legal determination. Nonetheless, it has influence in court.",
      "The significance of an accidental ruling quickly became clear when the local prosecutor cited it in exonerating the deputies and officers. It was one example among dozens AP found in which prosecutors referenced autopsy outcomes to close investigations, including other cases involving severe force.",
      "Jen Dold figured the last chance to hold the deputies in her brother\u2019s death accountable was a lawsuit.",
      "Looking for a lawyer, the family found a promising lead. Seven years before her brother\u2019s death, Deputy McGee \u2014 the first one into Dold\u2019s home \u2014 had fired his Taser in a fatal struggle with another man in mental distress. Dold was not his first death on duty.",
      "The county had settled that family\u2019s lawsuit. The Dolds contacted the lawyer, who took their case but cautioned litigation would be arduous. Officers get protections, including qualified immunity, which shield them from liability. The accidental manner of death would not help.",
      "As the lawsuit ground on, the attorney discovered something intriguing. The day after Alex Dold\u2019s autopsy, Selove fired the doctor who did it.",
      "Now it was February 2022. Jen Dold huddled with her mother and sister around a laptop to watch their attorney question Dr. Stanley Adams, a forensic pathologist who worked for the U.S. military before Snohomish County.",
      "Their lawyer asked Adams to review Dold\u2019s autopsy report. For the first time, Adams learned that, after he was fired, Selove had changed his conclusion from homicide and labeled it an accident.",
      "\u201cI have a little bit of heartburn with that because he took my correct answer and he changed it to an incorrect answer,\u201d Adams said.",
      "\u201cWhy do you say it\u2019s a homicide?\u201d the lawyer asked.",
      "\u201cBecause when one human being does an action or neglects to do an action that caused the death of another, it really doesn\u2019t matter about the intent,\u201d Adams replied.",
      "The family hugged.",
      "\u201cWe just kept saying, \u2018Did he really just say that? Did he really just say \u2018homicide'?\u201d Jen Dold recalled.",
      "Adams told AP that under the settlement he reached over his termination, he couldn\u2019t discuss his employment. But in a complaint filed with Snohomish County, Adams wrote he was fired for documenting Selove\u2019s violations of county policies and guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Without saying which policies, Adams called the violations a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Selove said Adams\u2019 homicide finding was unrelated to his firing. They disagreed over other matters, he said, but couldn\u2019t elaborate due to the settlement. His office's policy on intent was a relic of a predecessor that he didn't need to follow, he said. And he never felt pressure from law enforcement in any restraint death, including one in 2015 where a detective was publicly accused of improperly influencing him.",
      "The county offered Dold\u2019s family around $1.5 million to end their case in 2023. Jen Dold wanted the settlement to require a change to homicide, but said the county wouldn\u2019t budge. She finally relented.",
      "\u201cThe process beat us down and we were ready for it to be over,\u201d she said.",
      "When a reporter reached Deputy McGee, who resigned within three months of Alex Dold\u2019s death, he said never to call again and hung up. The deputy who responded with McGee resigned in 2019 after being accused of having sex on duty, according to police disciplinary records.",
      "In the seven years since her brother\u2019s death, the extent of the force troubles Jen Dold, as does the pain and fear he must have felt as he struggled to breathe.",
      "A simple question haunts her: What if the medical examiner\u2019s report was different by just one word \u2014 homicide?",
      "While loved ones like Jen Dold want a homicide ruling, powerful institutions may not. The AP found attempts at influencing medical officials in other cases by elected and appointed officials \u2014 the police chief or sheriff, the mayor \u2014 as well as outside sources, such as Axon Enterprise Inc., the maker of Tasers.",
      "In November 2021, the chief medical examiner in North Dakota was deciding how to rule the death of a 43-year-old man police encountered in a Bismarck neighborhood who was on methamphetamine, drenched in sweat and agitated because he believed his daughter was in danger.",
      "Police video that has never been reported before shows Ryan Pederson, a local hockey club coach and single father, resisted when officers tried to handcuff him. Three of them fired their Tasers at nearly the same time, with one connecting.",
      "Awakened by the commotion, a neighbor recorded police holding Pederson face down under a streetlight, remarking, \u201cI think they George Floyded him.\u201d",
      "The autopsy was done by Dr. Barrie Miller, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner.",
      "Emails AP obtained show Miller spoke with Michael Brave, then a longtime Axon attorney, who late into a Friday night and over one weekend emailed her more than a dozen documents, including research papers and book chapters co-authored by company officials that downplayed the risks of Tasers.",
      "\u201cGreat day!!\u201d Brave wrote in one. \u201cAfter our conversation I thought of a couple more documents you might want to have.\u201d",
      "He attached a checklist that tells forensic pathologists what evidence to collect during death investigations involving Tasers. Other materials described how the device works or discussed purported symptoms of excited delirium syndrome, such as \u201csuperhuman strength\u201d and high pain tolerance.",
      "Brave also sent a chart from a study he contributed to which argued that people rarely, if ever, die when police restrain them face down in what\u2019s known as prone position \u2014 the way officers restrained Pederson. While police do use prone restraint every day without harm, AP\u2019s investigation, done with the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism and FRONTLINE (PBS), identified 44 deaths from 2012-2021 where a medical examiner or coroner ruled that prone restraint caused or contributed. In another 17 cases involving prone restraint, positional asphyxia or asphyxia due to restraint was cited as a cause or contributing factor.",
      "Four days later, Miller ruled Pederson\u2019s death was due to methamphetamine-induced \u201cpsychomotor agitation\u201d and \u201cphysical exertion with physical restraint.\u201d The cause mentioned neither Tasers nor officers. The manner was undetermined \u2014 one of five choices along with accident, homicide, natural and suicide.",
      "Miller didn\u2019t respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. She was fired this spring after police went to her office. Brave, now a partner in a Phoenix law firm, said Miller contacted him wanting information about how Tasers work. He said he wasn\u2019t trying to influence her \u2014 he wanted her to have the correct information. An Axon official did not respond to messages.",
      "Checklists like the one Brave sent Miller have long been an Axon strategy.",
      "In a 2018 \u201cManaging Your Medical Examiner\u201d web presentation, a longtime member of the company\u2019s board of directors, Mark Kroll, urged law enforcement officials and prosecutors to use a company-created checklist. The essence: Influence the manner of death ruling. \u201cControl the narrative\u201d by getting the deceased\u2019s criminal and medical history. Drop in on the forensic pathologist and talk about cases. And if they are \u201chostile,\u201d line up police-friendly experts to counter them.",
      "Kroll left Axon this year. In an email to AP, he questioned how medical examiners arrive at a manner of death, saying their opinion is not \u201cinfallible truth\u201d but rather \u201cdriven by personal biases, local politics, sex of the medical examiner, religion, and years on the job.\u201d Noting the role drugs and preexisting conditions can play, he called some who die \u201cwalking time bombs.\u201d",
      "Axon has exerted influence in other ways. In autopsy reports, some medical officials shift culpability by citing company-funded research. And in the early 2000s, the company sent a chill through forensic pathology when, faced with product liability lawsuits, it launched a campaign to undermine rulings that Tasers caused or even contributed to deaths.",
      "One important victory came after the company sued a medical examiner in Ohio who had partially blamed the device in three fatal encounters. A judge required the medical examiner to change the manner of death from homicide and remove Taser references in the cause.",
      "\u201cDangerously close to intimidation,\u201d the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners said at the time.",
      "Pressure is a reality of forensic pathology. In a 2011 survey not specific to Taser or arrest-related deaths, 22% of the association\u2019s members said elected or appointed officials had leaned on them to change cause or manner of death. And 25% of those who resisted said they \u201csuffered consequences,\u201d including being fired.",
      "In a follow-up paper, the association said death investigations and decisions must be \u201cindependent from law enforcement and prosecutors,\u201d and based on scientific evidence and research.",
      "Cases in North Carolina and Vermont show what can happen behind the scenes.",
      "Marcus Smith was having a mental health breakdown at a music festival in 2018 and approached Greensboro, North Carolina, police for help. When he panicked and tried to flee, officers pinned Smith, 38, face down to the ground, records show.",
      "After an associate chief medical examiner for North Carolina ruled it a homicide, a police lawyer emailed the state\u2019s chief medical examiner in correspondence marked highly confidential and said Smith\u2019s death should have been undetermined because health problems, cocaine and alcohol could be to blame. He called the homicide classification \u201cwrong and it is being used by those with ulterior motives and visions of monetary payouts \u2026 to baselessly vilify police officers.\u201d",
      "The police lawyer, Amiel Rossabi, told AP in an email that he \u201cwas not pressuring anyone\u201d but was instead pointing out that, based on his research, the medical examiner was wrong. The chief medical examiner and the pathologist who performed the autopsy did not respond to emails and phone messages.",
      "In March 2019, an officer\u2019s punch fractured a 54-year-old man\u2019s skull in Burlington, Vermont. Douglas Kilburn died days later. After a Vermont Health Department doctor called it a homicide, Burlington\u2019s police chief questioned the finding in an email to the state health commissioner, saying he had conferred with the mayor.",
      "The former chief, Brandon del Pozo, now an assistant professor of medicine at Brown University, told AP he sent the email after getting unsatisfying answers from the medical examiner about the degree of certainty that it was homicide. It could have been undetermined, del Pozo said. Former Mayor Miro Weinberger told AP that Kilburn\u2019s death was tragic but the medical examiner\u2019s report had \u201cconfusing and contradictory findings.\u201d",
      "Neither state office budged from its homicide ruling. No officer was charged, but lawsuits resulted in payouts of $2.5 million in North Carolina and $45,000 in Vermont.",
      "An analysis by AP showed that death rulings can vary according to how close the medical examiner or coroner is to local law enforcement.",
      "State offices such as in Vermont and North Carolina labeled as accidents about 30% of deaths. Local agencies investigating deaths in their own communities classified nearly 50% of deaths as accidents. That number was higher still when the local agency was part of law enforcement, such as Texas\u2019 justice of the peace system or the sheriff-coroners in many California counties.",
      "In one notable California restraint death, a forensic pathologist resigned after learning the sheriff changed the manner from homicide to accident. The ensuing controversy led San Joaquin County to create an independent medical examiner\u2019s office.",
      "The death of Kyle Briones in the sprawl east of Los Angeles shows how important the coincidence of where someone dies can be.",
      "The 28-year-old was driving in the pre-dawn hours when a tire blew out. His car swerved and hit a street sign before stopping in a San Bernardino County farm field.",
      "Briones survived the wreck \u2014 but not the night.",
      "Ontario Police Department officers responding to a 911 call for an injured motorist pulled him from the car. Although there were no drugs or alcohol in his system, Briones was disoriented and wobbled as he walked. Police ordered him to sit. When Briones didn\u2019t respond, officers shocked him with a Taser, threw him to the ground and placed him face down for more than six minutes, according to court records. The department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "By the time paramedics got to him, it was too late.",
      "Had Briones crashed a mile down the road, across the line dividing San Bernardino and Riverside counties, what happened next might have gone far differently.",
      "The two counties, known together as the Inland Empire, each have more than 2 million people and saw similar patterns in their arrest-related deaths \u2014 typically, people in mental health or drug emergencies died after a struggle. Each has a sheriff-coroner death investigation system.",
      "Yet in these cases, they arrived at opposite conclusions. Among the 13 deaths AP identified from 2012-2021 in Riverside County, the coroner\u2019s office classified 11 as homicides. The coroner\u2019s division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department ruled on 12 deaths, labeling none a homicide.",
      "In the Briones death, the chief forensic pathologist working for the San Bernardino County coroner blamed preexisting heart and lung conditions. Dr. Frank Sheridan said that \u2014 at 317 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches \u2014 Briones was \u201cmorbidly obese.\u201d He ruled the death natural.",
      "The Briones family couldn\u2019t understand. Their attorney hired as an expert witness a former medical examiner who had worked for Ventura County, on the other side of Los Angeles. He said Briones died because officers held him down with pressure on his back so he couldn\u2019t breathe, and that it should be a homicide. The lawsuit settled for $2.75 million. Sheridan did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "San Bernardino was one of 19 agencies in the United States that had four or more deaths in AP\u2019s database and ruled none a homicide.",
      "In Miami-Dade County, for instance, all deaths in AP\u2019s data involving Tasers were ruled accidents. The one man who was shocked in Miami-Dade but whose death was not an accident died six years later \u2014 in neighboring Broward County, where a medical examiner called Derrick Blake\u2019s death a homicide attributable to tasing.",
      "All 16 deaths in Miami-Dade over the 10 years AP analyzed were accidents. Just one of Broward County\u2019s four deaths was. Miami\u2019s chief medical examiner declined to comment.",
      "The 19 agencies with four or more deaths but no homicides cover at least 17 million people. One was the medical examiner\u2019s office in Snohomish County, Washington. The same place where Jen Dold fought, to no avail, to reclassify her brother\u2019s death.",

    "story": [
      "A couple has dropped a lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule earlier this year that frozen embryos are what it called \"extrauterine children.\"",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A judge last week dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit that led the Alabama Supreme Court to rule that frozen embryos are \u201cextrauterine children,\u201d a decision that drew national attention and temporarily halted in vitro fertilization services in the state.",
      "A couple, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit over the accidental destruction of their last frozen embryo, asked to drop the suit. A judge granted the request and dismissed the case Friday, according to state court records. Two other couples had dropped similar lawsuits in August.",
      "The court order did not detail the reason for dropping the lawsuit or if a settlement had been reached. Trip Smalley, a lawyer representing the couple, did not immediately return an email and telephone message seeking comment.",
      "The three couples had their embryos destroyed in 2020 when a hospital patient wandered into the storage area. The patient opened the container, picked up embryos and dropped them to the floor.",
      "The Alabama Supreme Court in February ruled that the three couples could pursue wrongful death claims for the destruction of the embryos. Justices, citing anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution, ruled that an 1872 state law allowing parents to sue over the death of a minor child, \u201capplies to all unborn children, regardless of their location.\u201d",
      "The decision became a flashpoint in the national debate over abortion and raised liability concerns for fertility clinics as they create, store and work with frozen embryos. Three large IVF providers in Alabama paused services in the wake of the ruling. Facing a public backlash to the decision, Alabama lawmakers approved immunity legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits and get IVF services restarted in the state.",
      "The couple, who had turned to IVF to have children, said in their 2021 lawsuit that the accident destroyed their final frozen embryo, which was being stored at the facility. Even though they had chosen not to implant it, \u201cthey considered this embryo a human being or life,\u201d their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit."

      "KABAENA, Indonesia -- The crystal blue waters that once surrounded Kabaena are murky brown now, and the octopi and colorful fish that locals used to catch nearby to eat and sell have fled. The lush seaweed they used to harvest is gone. And parents who grew up swimming happily in the Flores Sea now warn their children to stay out of the water for fear of itchy rashes or skin lesions.",
      "The people of Kabaena \u2014 including Indigenous Bajau, a group that has traditionally lived near and relied on the sea \u2014 are among what experts estimate are thousands of communities around Indonesia where traditional ways of life have been devastated by the impacts of a rapidly expanding mining industry. Most of the materials mined in Indonesia fuel the international supply chain for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more.",
      "\u201cAll residents here have felt the impact,\u201d said Amiruddin, 53, a fisherman who like many Indonesians uses only one name.",
      "With the world's largest known nickel reserves and rich deposits of cobalt, bauxite and other materials, Indonesia has been experiencing a mining boom on demand for stainless steel, electric vehicle batteries and more that are needed for the global energy transition. The island nation has sought to expand its mining and processing capabilities while facing backlash from international and local watchdogs for various environmental concerns.",
      "Across Indonesia, nickel processing plants sometimes sprawl just a few minutes from the sea, and barges ready to carry away nickel ore often dot the water. Some mines operate near schools.",
      "Local communities and the natural environments around these mines can bear the burden of this intense demand. From 2001 to 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares (about 3.5 million acres) of trees due to mining, with Indonesia having the highest loss, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute.",
      "______",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "______",
      "On Kabaena, over 3,700 hectares (9,140 acres) of forest \u2014 including protected forest \u2014 were cleared by mining companies between 2001 to 2023, according to data analysis by international environmental organization Mighty Earth. That deforestation has devastated the environment and livelihoods on Kabaena, said Amanda Hurowitz, a senior director at Mighty Earth.",
      "Where fishers could once catch fish to sell or feed their families, the water is now filled with runoff sediment from mining activities and no fish are to be found. Fishers with boats must travel farther, using expensive petrol, and wind up with smaller catches that earn them less money. Those without boats often resort to eating the small shellfish they can find in the murky water around their homes.",
      "\u201c(I would) fish near there by setting a net,\u201d Ilyas, 70, said while pointing in front of his home. \u201cNow it\u2019s far away before (fish) are found.\u201d",
      "Communities on land are experiencing the mines' impact as well: Sugar cane, palm and clove trees cultivated for food and income don't grow as well, with water sources used for crops tainted by mining activities, residents said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the effect: The growth of the sugar palm trees will not be as good because of the influence of mining,\u201d said Amal Susanto, 32, a palm sugar farmer in an area of Kabaena where exploration permits have been granted but mining has not yet begun. \u201cI hope no mines around here, because our income will be impacted.\u201d",
      "Since the mines have opened, there's been a spike in residents complaining of itchy skin, sore throats and other health issues. Villagers no longer want to bathe or wash clothes in the water; when they do, they get itchy skin and rashes said Nina, 33, an Indigenous Bajau resident of Kabaena.",
      "Lab results from samples of rivers, sea water, dust and shellfish from Kabaena taken by Satya Bumi, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Indonesia, in July and November showed hazardous levels of nickel, lead and cadmium \u2014 common mining byproducts.",
      "Exposure to these metals at the levels seen in the lab samples could lead to cancer, cardiovascular, kidney and other chronic diseases, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor at Columbia University who researches molecular biology and reviewed the lab results.",
      "\u201cIf people on this island are using the river water as drinking water \u2014 which has higher levels of the metals \u2014 and then if they are also eating the shellfish and breathe the air ... you cannot escape basically any of the exposure to those toxic metals,\u201d Schilling told AP.",
      "The impact isn\u2019t limited to Kabaena. Across the sea to the north, a nickel mine near the village of Torobulu pushes up against a tattered soccer field and nearby athletic courts.",
      "The impacts and mining continue despite a March 2024 ruling by Indonesia's constitutional court that small islands such as Kabaena require special protection from abnormally dangerous activities, including mining, as they threaten ecosystems in vulnerable areas.",
      "But Indonesia's government is still issuing mining permits for small islands, said Sayyidatiihayaa Afra, a researcher at Satya Bumi.",
      "Since the constitutional court ruling, forest loss has continued on Kabaena, with 150 hectares (370 acres) cleared in areas approved for mining on the island since April 1, according to data analysis by Mighty Earth. Over half of the forest loss occurred in a concession owned by mining company Tonia Mitra Sejahtera.",
      "Tonia Mitra Sejahtera did not respond to a request for interviews or comment. Mining company Anugrah Harisma Barakah \u2014 which caused the most deforestation on Kabaena, according to Satya Bumi \u2014 also did not answer the publicly listed phone number when AP made requests for interviews or comment.",
      "Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, people on Kabaena say they feel helpless.",
      "\u201cWhat else can we do if the water is like this?\u201d said Nina. \"We\u2019re small people \u2014 we can\u2019t do anything. We have to surrender.\u201d",

      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn\u2019t hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s not becoming a safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to be prepared.\u201d",
      "Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there\u2019s a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.",
      "With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California\u2019s Inland Empire.",
      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",
      "Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world\u2019s largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.",
      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",

      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",

      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",

      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

      "Cyprus\u2019 top diplomat says his country stands ready to help eliminate Syria\u2019s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and to support a search for people whose fate remains unknown after more than a decade of war",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus stands ready to help eliminate Syria\u2019s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and to support a search for people whose fate remains unknown after more than a decade of war, the top Cypriot diplomat said Saturday.",
      "Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos said Cyprus\u2019 offer is grounded on its own past experience both with helping rid Syria of chemical weapons 11 years ago and its own ongoing, decades-old search for hundreds of people who disappeared amid fighting between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriots in the 1960s and a 1974 Turkish invasion.",
      "Cyprus in 2013 hosted the support base of a mission jointly run by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to remove and dispose of Syria's chemical weapons.",
      "\u201cAs a neighboring country located just 65 miles from Syria, Cyprus has a vested interest in Syria\u2019s future. Developments there will directly impact Cyprus, particularly in terms of potential new migratory flows and the risks of terrorism and extremism,\u201d Kombos told The Associated Press in written replies to questions.",
      "Kombos said there are \u201cprofound concerns\u201d among his counterparts across the region over Syria\u2019s future security, especially regarding a possible resurgence of extremist groups like Islamic State in a fragmented and polarized society.",
      "Other challenges include new migratory flows from the country as well as ensuring the safety and rights of women and minorities including Druze, Christians, Jews and Kurds, so that the \u201crich mosaic of Syria is preserved.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is particularly critical in light of potential social and demographic engineering disguised as \u201csecurity\u201d arrangements, which could further destabilize the country,\u201d Kombos said.",
      "The diplomat also pointed to the recent proliferation of narcotics production like the stimulant Captagon that is interconnected with smuggling networks involved in people and arms trafficking.",
      "Kombos said ongoing attacks against Syria\u2019s Kurds must stop immediately, given the role that Kurdish forces have played in combating extremist forces like the IS group in the past decade.",
      "A Syrian-led process transitioning the country to an inclusive democracy should integrate the Kurds\u2019 \u201clegitimate asks\u201d while safeguarding the country\u2019s unity and territorial integrity.",
      "Saleh Muslim, a member of the Kurdish Presidential Council, said in an interview that the Kurds primarily seek \u201cequality\u201d enshrined in rights accorded to all in any democracy.",
      "He said a future form of governance could accord autonomy to the Kurds under some kind of federal structure.",
      "\u201cBut the important thing is to have democratic rights for all the Syrians and including the Kurdish people,\u201d he said.",
      "Muslim warned that the Kurdish-majority city of Kobani, near Syria\u2019s border with Turkey, is in \u201cvery big danger\u201d of falling into the hands of Turkish-backed forces, and accused Turkey of trying to occupy it.",
      "Kombos said the international community needs to ensure that the influence Turkey is trying to exert in Syria is \u201cnot going to create an even worse situation than there already is.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever the future landscape in Syria, it will have a direct and far-reaching impact on the region, the European Union and the broader international community,\u201d Kombos said."

      "Authorities in the German city of Magdeburg say at least two people were killed and dozens were injured after a car plowed into a busy Christmas market what officials called a deliberate attack",
      "MAGDEBURG, Germany -- Germans began Saturday mourning another violent attack and their shaken sense of security after a Saudi doctor drove a black BMW into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers on Friday evening, killing at least two people, including a small child, and injuring at least 60 others in what authorities called a deliberate attack.",
      "Authorities identified the suspect as a 50-year-old who has been living in Germany for nearly two decades and practicing medicine there. He was arrested Friday evening at the site of the attack as medical officials tended to the injured, and was taken into custody for questioning.",
      "But on Saturday there were still no answers as to what caused the man to drive into a crowd in the eastern Germany city of Magdeburg.",
      "The violence shocked the country and the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that\u2019s part of a centuries-old German tradition. It prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg\u2019s loss.",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Interior Minister Nancy Faeser were due to travel to Magdeburg on Saturday, and a memorial service is to take place in the city cathedral in the evening.",
      "\u201cMy thoughts are with the victims and their relatives,\" Scholz wrote on X. \"We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.\u201d",
      "Magdeburg is a city of about 240,000 people, west of Berlin, that serves as Saxony-Anhalt\u2019s capital. Friday\u2019s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.",
      "Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect\u2019s arrest at a tram stop in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone, his head arched up slightly. Other officers soon arrived and took the man into custody.",
      "The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured.",
      "\u201cAs things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,\" Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. \u201cEvery human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.\u201d",
      "Authorities identified the suspect as a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006 and who had been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign ministry condemned the attack on X but did not mention the suspect\u2019s connection to the kingdom.",
      "Christmas markets are a German holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages, now successfully exported to much of the Western world.",
      "Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market\u2019s festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands.",
      "Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud \u201cyou had to assume that something terrible had happened.\u201d",
      "She called the attack \u201ca dark day\u201d for the city.",
      "\u201cWe are shaking,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cFull of sympathy for the relatives, also in the hope that nothing has happened to our relatives, friends and acquaintances.\u201d",
      "The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country. He said flags would be lowered to half-staff in Saxony-Anhalt and that the federal government planned to do the same.",
      "\u201cIt is really one of the worst things one can imagine, particularly in connection with what a Christmas market should bring,\" the governor said.",

      "The toppling of Bashar Assad has raised tentative hopes that Syrians might live peacefully and as equals after a half century of authoritarian rule",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The toppling of Bashar Assad has raised tentative hopes that Syrians might live peacefully and as equals after a half century of authoritarian rule.",
      "While there have been bursts of deadly sectarian violence in the days since Assad was ousted, it\u2019s nothing close to what was feared after nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "Much credit for the relative calm so far is being given to the Islamic militant group that led the insurgency against Assad and is helping to rebuild the country and unite its many factions. The group \u2014 Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2014 had ties to al-Qaida, but it has vowed not to discriminate against any religion or ethnicity, and it has denounced revenge killings.",
      "In the days since Assad\u2019s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and experts who monitor Syria. The vast majority have been from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam that the Assad family adheres to.",
      "Given the key role Alawites played in Assad's brutally repressive government, experts had expected sectarian violence to be more widespread. But HTS has worked to reduce tensions in villages where revenge killings \u2014 as well as looting and harassment \u2014 have taken place, according to local activists.",
      "Whether peace and pluralism will prevail longer-term remains to be seen, experts caution.",
      "\u201cThe extent of the reprisals has been quite limited,\" said Hilal Khashan, a political science professor at the American University of Beirut. \"We hope this violence will not escalate, leading to an outburst of civil strife.\u201d",
      "During the Assad family\u2019s 50 years of iron-fisted rule, Alawites held many top positions in the military and in the intelligence and security services, which ran prisons where thousands of people accused of anti-government activities were tortured and killed, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interim government led by HTS has vowed to gather evidence and hold trials in a special court against former officials who oversaw, or worked in, Assad's notorious prisons. It has also promised amnesty for other government workers and former members of the military, some of whom have started handing in their weapons.",
      "\u201cIf we want to establish social peace there must be justice, and there is no justice without accountability,\u201d said Obeida Arnaout, a spokesman for the interim government. \u201cThose who have blood on their hands will get no amnesty.\u201d",
      "The interim government has urged reconciliation among the country\u2019s different ethnic factions \u2014 mainly Arabs and Kurds \u2014 and mutual respect among its religious groups. Three-quarters of Syria's 23 million citizens are Sunnis, one-tenth are Alawites, and the rest are a mix of Christians, Ismaili Shiites and Druze.",
      "Under Assad, Syrians enjoyed religious and other freedoms. Men and women mingled freely at beaches and other public places; restaurants served alcoholic beverages; and women held senior posts in government.",
      "Now that power resides in the hands of HTS, many Syrians \u2014 as well as Western governments and human rights groups \u2014 are concerned the country could be transformed into a theocracy.",
      "So far, the HTS-led coalition has not imposed any strict religious rules, such as forcing women to wear veils, and it has allowed journalists from around the world to report freely. Over years of control in the northwest Syrian province of Idlib, HTS allowed Christians and Druze to practice without interference.",
      "HTS is led by a former al-Qaida member who has renounced extremism and spent years working to remake his public image, depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. Still, the United States, other Western countries and the U.N. still consider HTS a terrorist organization \u2014 a branch of al-Qaida in Syria, but with a different name.",
      "One of the top priorities of HTS and its leader \u2013 Ahmad al-Sharaa -- is to get the terror designation removed, which could then lead to economic sanctions against Syria being lifted.",
      "U.S. officials say al-Sharaa\u2019s public statements about protecting minority and women\u2019s rights are welcomed. But they are skeptical he will follow through on them in the long run.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last weekend that the U.S. is in contact with HTS and that its \"message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we\u2019re prepared to help them do so.\u201d",
      "Since Assad fled the country, at least 72 men and women have been killed in sectarian violence, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor based in Britain. It says the killings occurred in four religiously mixed provinces \u2014 Hama and Homs in central Syria, and Tartus and Latakia along its eastern coast.",
      "Gunmen stormed the village of Bahra in Hama province on Dec. 9, and killed a dozen Alawites over three days \u2014 eight of whom were from the same family, according to a resident of the village who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. In nearby Mouaa, six men were killed, and in Um al-Amad, a man and his son were shot dead, the resident of Bahra said.",
      "The three villages are now almost empty after the most residents fled to the Alawite heartland, in the coastal province of Tartus, the Bahra resident said. \u201cThe reason why I am speaking is to try stop the killings,\u201d he said.",
      "In the Assad stronghold of Masyaf, gunmen last week kidnapped Muhieddine al-Haybe, the brother of a Shiite cleric who fled the town in Hama province shortly after the fall of Assad\u2019s government, according to an anti-Assad activist who would only provide his first name, Hussein, out of concern for his safety. He said al-Haybe's body and three other unidentified dead bodies were later found near a military post.",
      "A third person from the area said the situation was tense for days until HTS hosted a meeting over the weekend that brought together Sunni and Alawite dignitaries from nearby villages, including Rabia, Tizin, Metnine and Mouaa. By the end of the meeting, the participants reconciled and agreed to end any acts of violence, according to this person, who is Alawite and insisted on anonymity out of fear.",
      "\u201cWe were also the victims of the regime,\u201d the person said, adding that the Assad government did not offer civilian jobs to Alawites, which put pressure on them to join the military and security services.",
      "The man said his house was looted and his six cows were stolen.",
      "There have been reports of al-Sharaa himself trying to keep the peace among Syria\u2019s many factions.",
      "Syrian media reported that he met in Damascus on Monday with a delegation from the Druze community and told them that his goal was to unite Syria and create a free society.",
      "Some Syrians say there might have been more sectarian violence in the aftermath of Assad's ouster had his forces mounted a serious fight against HTS and other militants behind the insurgency. Instead, Assad's army essentially melted away and chose not to defend his government.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing some sectarian incidents, but they are all individuals acts,\u201d said Rayan Maarouf, an anti-Assad activist who is a member of Syria's Druze minority in the southern city of Sweida.",

      "Asnani, now a school teacher, was only 17 at the time. Her father, who was a fisherman, never returned home from sea. She doesn't know how she survived. \u201cI cannot swim. I could only rely on dhikr (Islamic prayer).\u201d",
      "On Dec. 26, 2004, a powerful 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa.",
      "But Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province, located closest to the earthquake\u2019s epicenter and with 18 of 23 districts and cities located in the coastal line in the Northern side of Sumatra, bore the brunt of the disaster with more than half of the total death toll reported.",
      "The worst-hit areas were in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh, according to the Aceh Disaster Management Agency.",
      "Asnani's Lampuuk village lies in a fishermen\u2019s community in Aceh Besar, known for its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters. However, on that day, it was among the hardest hit, with waves more than 30 meters (98 feet) high which changed the coastline in Aceh and led to land subsidence after the earthquake.",
      "Buildings by the coast were flattened to the ground except for Rahmatullah Mosque, 500 meters (1,600 feet) from the shore, and about 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from Asnani\u2019s house. The photo of the place of worship, left pretty much unscathed, later became iconic.",
      "After the disastrous event, thousands, including Asnani, had to relocate to start afresh. She moved with her uncle to another region in Aceh to continue her studies. After she got married, she returned in 2007 to her parents' house which was rebuilt with assistance from the Turkish government and lived there for 10 years.",
      "Many international donors and organizations poured in money to help rebuild the affected areas that lost schools, hospitals and basic infrastructure, made stronger than before the tsunami hit.",
      "Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh recorded more than 1,400 wrecked schools and about 150,000 students had their education process disrupted by the destructive waves in a report published in 2019.",
      "Three \u201cescape buildings\u201d were also constructed in a relatively safer area to accommodate thousands of people if an earthquake and tsunami strike.",
      "Across the province, memories of the tsunami can be felt almost everywhere.",
      "The Aceh Tsunami Museum in Banda Aceh houses photos of the aftermath and vehicle debris, serving as a constant reminder of what was lost that day. Local authorities have also turned a former floating diesel-powered power plant barge that washed about 6 kilometers (about 4 miles) inland by the tsunami into another memorial place.",
      "Both places have become the most popular tourist destinations in the area.",
      "But development never stops and 20 years after the tsunami the Aceh coast is brimming with residential housing, cafes and restaurants, as well as tourism support facilities, while the hills in some areas from which people are currently being mined for sand and stone.",
      "Fazli, the head of Preparedness in Aceh Disaster Management Agency, said that the government initially stipulated that there should be no activity up to 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) from the coast. Over time, many displaced fishermen returned to their original coastal homes, drawn by their livelihoods and ties to the sea, despite having received housing elsewhere.",
      "He also said the agency has \u201cprovided the Acehnese people with information \u201d to deal with a potential tsunami. \"People already know what to do,\u201d said Fazli, who, like other Indonesians, uses a single name.",
      "Siti Ikramatoun, a sociologist in Banda Aceh, said that despite years of recovery and rebuilding, the people of Aceh must stay vigilant.",
      "\u201cIf people experienced (the tsunami), they may have an instinct to anticipate it. But those who do not have the experience, they won\u2019t get what to do,\u201d Ikramatoun said.",
      "Various communities in Aceh commemorate the tsunami yearly along with the government and local authorities.",
      "In Banda Aceh, art communities in early December spread disaster awareness through theatrical or musical performances that can be easier for people to follow and target all groups, including those born after the tsunami.",
      "Muslina, 43, a civil servant, took her youngest son to the Aceh Tsunami Museum to watch one of the shows. She lost relatives and loved ones 20 years ago and she wants to make sure she always remembers them.",
      "\u201cEarlier my son asked me if there might be another tsunami when he grows up,\" she said. \u201cI told him I do not know. Only God knows, but if there is a strong earthquake and the seawater recedes, we run, run, run to find higher ground.\u201d"

      "Authorities in the German city of Magdeburg say at least two people were killed and dozens were injured after a car plowed into a busy Christmas market what officials called a deliberate attack",
      "MAGDEBURG, Germany -- A car plowed into a busy outdoor Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg on Friday, killing at least two people and injuring at least 60 others in what authorities called a deliberate attack.",
      "The driver was arrested at the scene shortly after the car barreled into the market at around 7 p.m., when it was teeming with holiday shoppers looking forward to the weekend.",
      "Verified bystander footage distributed by the German news agency dpa showed the suspect\u2019s arrest on a walkway in the middle of the road. A nearby police officer pointing a handgun at the man shouted at him as he lay prone. Other officers soon arrived to take the man into custody.",
      "The two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler, but officials said additional deaths couldn't be ruled out because 15 people had been seriously injured.",
      "The violence shocked the city, bringing its mayor to the verge of tears and marring a festive event that's part of a centuries-old German tradition. It also prompted several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution and out of solidarity with Magdeburg's loss.",
      "The suspect is a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who moved to Germany in 2006, Tamara Zieschang, the interior minister for the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said at a news conference. He has been practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg, she said.",
      "\u201cAs things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,\" Saxony-Anhalt's governor, Reiner Haseloff, told reporters. \"Every human life that has fallen victim to this attack is a terrible tragedy and one human life too many.\"",
      "The violence occurred in Magdeburg, a city of about 240,000 people west of Berlin that serves as Saxony-Anhalt\u2019s capital. Friday's attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.",
      "Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture as an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country.",
      "German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant.",
      "Hours after Friday's tragedy, the wail of sirens clashed with the market\u2019s festive ornaments, stars and leafy garlands.",
      "Magdeburg resident Dorin Steffen told dpa that she was at a concert in a nearby church when she heard the sirens. The cacophony was so loud \u201cyou had to assume that something terrible had happened.\u201d",
      "She called the attack \u201ca dark day\u201d for the city.",
      "\u201cWe are shaking,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cFull of sympathy for the relatives, also in the hope that nothing has happened to our relatives, friends and acquaintances.\u201d",
      "The attack reverberated far beyond Magdeburg, with Haseloff calling it a catastrophe for the city, state and country. He said flags would be lowered to half-staff in Saxony-Anhalt and that the federal government planned to do the same.",
      "\u201cIt is really one of the worst things one can imagine, particularly in connection with what a Christmas market should bring,\" the governor said.",

      "The late King Constantine II and his family members were stripped of Greek citizenship in 1994 in a dispute with the government over formerly royal property and over claims that he refused to renounce any right to the Greek throne for his descendants.",
      "Interior Ministry official Athanasios Balerpas said that relatives of the late king, who died last year at the age of 82, signed a declaration Thursday acknowledging the republican government and adopting a new surname, \u201cDe Grece\u201d \u2013 French for \u201cof Greece.\u201d",
      "\u201cA historically pending matter is being resolved,\u201d Balerpas told state-run radio. \u201cLet\u2019s look to the future now. I think it\u2019s a good moment because it closes an account from the past and we can now look forward as a people.\u201d",

      "The Greek monarchy was abolished by referendum in December 1974, when voters overwhelmingly backed a republican constitution, months after the fall of a seven-year military dictatorship.",
      "Members of the royal family lived in exile for decades before Constantine returned as a private citizen in his seventies. They were stripped of their Greek citizenship in 1994 during a legal battle over the former royal estate, which is now state-owned.",
      "They had previously refused to adopt a surname, distancing themselves from the name Glucksburg, assigned in a 1994 law, which they saw as linking them too closely to their German ancestry and making them seem less legitimately Greek.",
      "The decision on citizenship must now be published in the official government gazette before they can apply for state identity cards and Greek passports.",
      "Lawmakers from center-left and left-wing opposition parties argued that the former royal family members should not have been permitted to choose their own surname but did not oppose their right to citizenship.",
      "Some lawmakers from center-left and left-wing opposition parties objected to the surname chosen by the former royal family members, arguing it sounds like a title rather than a standard surname, but did not oppose the their right to citizenship."

      "CAIRO -- Even with hopes running high, so much can go wrong when a country ousts a longtime dictator and tries to start anew. The Middle Eastern and North African nations that attempted to transition to democracy in recent years can attest to that.",
      "Now it's Syria's turn to try to get it right.",
      "It\u2019s hard to draw lessons from the experiences of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Sudan since the wave of Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2011, as each country\u2019s dynamics are different, But there are common themes.",
      "In some cases, \u201cthe Revolution\u201d was lost when armed factions battled it out for power or an ambitious would-be strongman emerged. In others, the miliary refused to cede control to civilians or foreign countries fueled conflicts by backing one side or another with money and weapons.",
      "Questions must be asked before major decisions are made that can spark a destabilizing backlash: How do you deal with the old police state \u2014 purge or compromise? What do you do first, hold elections or write a constitution? And how do you fix a crippled economy riddled with corruption?",
      "So far, Syria\u2019s transition has been surprisingly smooth. But it's only been two weeks since President Bashar Assad was toppled, and many of those same dangers lurk in the background.",
      "The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in extremist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn't clear how or whether they plan to share power.",
      "Other armed factions \u2014 or even remnants of Assad's feared security forces \u2014 could lash out. And it remains to be seen whether the Kurds, who hold autonomous rule in the east, will be brought back into the fold, especially when Turkey fiercely opposes the main Kurdish faction.",
      "Groups such as the Alawites, to whom Assad's family belongs, fear being squeezed out of any role, or worse, being targeted for revenge.",
      "Here's a look at the power dynamics in some of these other countries:",
      "Protests forced Yemen\u2019s Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign in November 2011, ending his 33-year rule. Under a deal brokered by Gulf countries, Saleh received immunity and handed his powers to his vice president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.",
      "Hadi was to serve as caretaker president for two years, during which a new constitution would be written, leading eventually to elections. But Saleh, who remained in the capital, Sanaa, allied himself with Houthi rebels based in the north \u2014 his longtime enemy -- in a bid to regain power.",
      "Backed by Saleh\u2019s loyalists, the Houthis seized Sanaa and much of the populated center of the country. Hadi and his government fled south, where they are based in the city of Aden and control southern and much of eastern Yemen.",
      "A Saudi-led coalition of Arab countries launched a bombardment campaign aimed at restoring Hadi\u2019s government. Since then, Yemen has been torn by civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people and caused one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.",
      "The war became a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Yemen has remained split between the Houthis, who later broke with Saleh\u2019s camp and killed Saleh, and Hadi\u2019s government. Various militias nominally back Hadi but also have their own interests and are funded by the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi met the most violent end of any of the region\u2019s strongmen. An uprising turned into a civil war, and then with NATO backing, the rebels seized the capital, Tripoli, and killed a fleeing Gadhafi in October 2011.",
      "The oil-rich nation quickly splintered into regions controlled by a dizzying array of militias, including local and tribal groups, nationalists and mainstream Islamist factions, and diehard jihadis such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.",
      "Attempts to stitch it back together with elections or agreements have failed.",
      "A disputed parliamentary election in 2014 led to two rival administrations: one in the east backed by powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, and the other in the west based in Tripoli that is backed by militias and recognized by the United Nations.",
      "Hifter tried to seize the west in 2019, triggering a 14-month war. Then, an attempt at a unity government and new elections fell apart, and once again Libya was left split between east-west governments.",
      "Foreign powers, including Russia, Turkey and the UAE, backed various sides. European countries have funneled money to the Tripoli government trying to stem the flow of migrants from Africa through Libya toward Europe, but the money has largely helped fund militias. Efforts to end the conflict remain deadlocked.",
      "In Sudan, the powerful military has thwarted attempts to transition to an elected civilian government.",
      "Pro-democracy protests prompted the military to remove strongman Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, and the generals took power for themselves. The protesters stayed in the streets, demanding a handover of power to civilians, despite a crackdown that killed hundreds.",
      "Finally, the generals agreed to a power-sharing deal with the pro-democracy alliance that led the protests.",
      "A civilian prime minister led a Cabinet backed by a council headed by two powerful generals, including one notorious for atrocities committed in Darfur and during the 2019 crackdown on protesters. But just before the military was supposed to hand over the council's leadership to civilians, the generals orchestrated a coup.",
      "A few months later, in April 2023, the generals turned on each other, triggering a war in which their forces have battled throughout the country, including in the capital, Khartoum. The war has been marked by atrocities, caused widespread hunger and driven millions from their homes, becoming the world\u2019s worst displacement crisis.",
      "The Arab Spring started in Tunisia more than 13 years ago. Until recently, the country was hailed as a role model in the transition to democracy. It held free elections and drafted a constitution lauded by Western rights groups.",
      "But since being elected in 2019, President Kais Saied has increased his powers in what activists call a backslide from democracy. Saied temporarily suspended the parliament, redrafted the constitution and launched a crackdown on his opponents, imprisoning hundreds allegedly for undermining state security \u2014 a claim autocrats have long used to stamp out dissent.",
      "The military has been the main power player in Egypt. It seized direct control after 18 days of protests forced longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak to resign on Feb. 11, 2011.",
      "Within 15 months, parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful opposition force during Mubarak\u2019s era, swept both votes. Despite repeatedly insisting it wouldn't seek to dominate politics, it formed a majority in parliament and created a Brotherhood-led government.",
      "Over the next year, turmoil increased over accusations by opponents that the Brotherhood was unfairly imposing its will on the country, including writing an Islamist-leaning constitution. Many, including the large Coptic Christian minority, feared Islamist rule.",
      "Amid anti-Brotherhood protests, the military stepped in and removed President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013, a move supported by many secular parties and activists. It launched a ferocious crackdown on the Brotherhood, killing hundreds. Militant violence swelled with attacks on security forces and Christians.",
      "Military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sissi was elected president in 2014 and has since increased the influence of the army on the government and economy. The government has gone further than Mubarak did in stifling dissent, arresting Islamists and secular activists, and silencing media criticism."

      "Da Luz had been waiting since 2021, and traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) by bus from southern Brazil when his chance arrived to ascend with the assistance of an organization called the Inclusion Collective. Its volunteers on Dec. 18 surrounded and shouldered the weight of a specialized wheelchair, set inside a metal frame as they helped da Luz upward.",
      "\u201cWhat logistics!\u201d da Luz exclaimed as their tightly packed throng helped him weave through one narrow stretch at the start of the trail.",
      "Inclusion Collective started three years ago and has completed more than 50 hikes, 12 of which to Pedra da Gavea, plus others on less challenging trails, according to Bruna Souza, the group\u2019s administrator.",
      "\u201cWe can show that if we have the will, inclusion can happen anywhere, not just where there\u2019s a ramp,\u201d she told The Associated Press along the trail. \u201cIt\u2019s not just shopping centers you can go to; you can go to other places. It can be fun for everyone.\u201d",

      "But within mere minutes, the clouds parted and some sunlight filtered down from the heavens, maybe just for him.",

      "Clashes in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province have killed at least 130 people in recent weeks, triggering road closures and other measures that have disrupted people\u2019s access to medicine, food, fuel, education and work.",
      "The violence flared on Nov. 21 when gunmen ambushed a vehicle convoy and killed 52 people, mostly Shiite Muslims. Nobody claimed responsibility for the assault, which triggered retaliatory gunfire and arson by rival groups in several areas.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ordered tribes to hand over their weapons and sign an agreement through government mediation to ensure compliance.",
      "\u201cA 15-day framework will be provided for voluntary weapon collection. All weapons must be handed over to the administration by February,\u201d provincial government spokesman Mohammed Ali Saif said.",
      "Authorities also ordered the dismantling of bunkers and the temporary reopening of roads on humanitarian grounds on an intermittent basis. Security personnel will guard convoys to ensure safe passage and there will be helicopters to address transport issues.",
      "\u201cBoth parties will refrain from any violent actions to keep the ground routes open. Otherwise, the administration will be compelled to close the routes again,\u201d the spokesman added.",
      "But a group of Shiite scholars said the confiscation of weapons could put the community at risk, and they expressed their disappointment with the order.",
      "\u201cThis approach will result in further harm,\u201d they said at a news conference in the city of Parachinar city. \u201cWithout weapons, residents will be at the mercy of terrorists who could easily capture and kill them.\u201d",
      "Shiite Muslims dominate parts of Kurram, although they are a minority in the rest of the country. The area has a history of sectarian conflict, with militant groups previously targeting the minority group.",
      "But they generally live peacefully alongside Sunni Muslims, who are the majority in Pakistan."

      "A powerful ethnic armed group in western Myanmar is claiming to have scored a major victory in the war against the ruling military, even as neighboring nations at a meeting in Thailand were discussing efforts to end the conflict peacefully",
      "BANGKOK -- A powerful ethnic armed group in western Myanmar claimed Friday to have scored a major victory in the war against the ruling military, even as neighboring nations at a meeting in Thailand were discussing efforts to end the conflict peacefully.",
      "The capture by the Arakan Army of a strategically important regional army headquarters in Rakhine state would put it a step closer to seizing control of the entire state, a goal not achieved by any of the several other rebel groups in other parts of Myanmar.",
      "Rakhine has become a focal point for Myanmar\u2019s nationwide civil war, in which pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy battle the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in 2021 after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "The apparent fall of the military\u2019s western command headquarters is the latest in a series of significant setbacks for the military government that began more than a year ago when a rebel alliance including the Arakan Army captured military bases, command centers, and strategic towns and cities along the Chinese border in Shan state in northeastern Myanmar.",
      "In August this year, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, another force in the rebel alliance, was the first group to seize a regional command headquarters, in the city of Lashio in the northeast. Myanmar\u2019s military has 14 important regional commands across the country.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press by audio message from an undisclosed location that his group had \u201ccompletely captured and controlled the entire western regional military headquarters based in Ann township\u201d on Friday at noon.",
      "Most of the township was captured two weeks ago, leaving the headquarters encircled. The headquarters' deputy commander, Brig. Gen. Thaung Tun, and its chief operating officer, Brig. Gen. Kyaw Kyaw Than, were among those taken prisoner, Khaing Thukha said.",
      "The headquarters had overseen operations in Rakhine and the southern part of neighboring Chin state, as well as Myanmar\u2019s territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal.",
      "The military government issued no news about the latest development, which could not be independently confirmed, because access to the internet and mobile phone services in the area is mostly cut off. The Arakan Army in its past official announcements has generally been conservative in its victory claims.",
      "The Arakan Army is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority, and seeks autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government. In September it launched its effort to capture Ann, about 395 kilometers (245 miles) northwest of Yangon. It began its offensive in Rakhine in November last year, and has now gained control of 13 of 17 townships, along with one in neighboring Chin state.",
      "Rakhine, formerly known as Arakan, was the site of a brutal army counterinsurgency operation in 2017 that drove about 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh.",
      "The Arakan Army has made extensive use of social media to document its operations and in recent days has used it to encourage the army's holdouts at the headquarters to surrender.",
      "Separately in Thailand\u2019s capital Bangkok, members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met Friday to renew their efforts to help bring peace to Myanmar. The meeting was described as an extended informal consultation.",
      "ASEAN in early 2021 agreed on a \u201c Five-Point Consensus \u201d for peace, but the military leadership in Myanmar did virtually nothing to implement it, frustrating the group\u2019s fellow members to the extent they have excluded members of Myanmar\u2019s ruling military from attending their meetings. There were no representatives of Myanmar at Friday\u2019s meeting.",
      "The peace plan calls for the immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar, a dialogue among all concerned parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid through ASEAN channels, and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all concerned parties.",
      "The foreign ministers and senior officials attending the Bangkok meeting reaffirmed their backing for the Five-Point Consensus.",
      "Critics have expressed dissatisfaction at ASEAN\u2019s conciliatory approach to Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals. The military government is condemned by many countries and rights organizations for its brutal war and suppression of democracy.",
      "\u201cThe principle laid down by ASEAN includes the words to find a Myanmar-owned and -led solution,\" said Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for Myanmar's opposition National Unity Government, or NUG. \u201cTherefore, it will never get a Myanmar-owned and -led solution by working side by side with the terrorist military group that is not representing the people and killing them every day, instead of dealing with the revolutionary forces, including the NUG, which represents the people of Myanmar.\"",
      "The NUG operates as a shadow government and stakes a claim to greater legitimacy than the ruling military.",
      "Bryony Lau, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, told The Associated Press that \u201cASEAN has needed to shake up its approach to Myanmar\u2019s crisis.\"",
      "\"But the meetings being held in Bangkok risk legitimizing the junta, which continues to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity with impunity against Myanmar\u2019s people,\u201d Lau said."

      "Trudeau participated in the swearing-in ceremony and will chair a meeting with his new Cabinet later in the afternoon. He is not expected to speak publicly Friday as he mulls his future.",
      "\u201cHe told us he had a difficult choice to make and that is the choice that he is facing at this time,\u201d said Rachel Bendayan, the official languages minister.",
      "Trudeau is facing rising discontent over his leadership, and the abrupt departure of his finance minister on Monday could be something he can\u2019t recover from.",
      "Parliament is now shut for the holidays until late next month, and a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote could be scheduled sometime afterward.",
      "Because Trudeau\u2019s Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished \u2014 NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has called on Trudeau to resign \u2014 and he made clear Friday the NDP will vote to bring down the government.",
      "\u201cNo matter who is leading the Liberal Party, this government\u2019s time is up. We will put forward a clear motion of non-confidence in the next sitting of the House of Commons,\u201d Singh said in letter released just before Trudeau was to reshuffle his Cabinet.",
      "The Liberals could delay Parliament\u2019s return if Trudeau decides to not run in the next year\u2019s election and allows for a party leadership race.",

      "\u201cOur leader has become a key obstacle preventing many progressive voters who have supported our work from doing so again in the next election,\u201d he said in a letter released Friday.",
      "Trudeau replaced ministers who aren\u2019t running again. And some ministers ended up having two roles after others suddenly left the Cabinet.",
      "\u201cI understand there is going to be a short runway. I\u2019m not blind to that,\u201d said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, Canada\u2019s new housing minister.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said a reshuffle was necessary because of recent Cabinet departures.",
      "\u201cIt might simply appear as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "Trudeau, who has led the country for nearly a decade, has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation.",
      "The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States \u2014 even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "Canada\u2019s Transport Minister Anita Anand, who on Friday added the role of minister of internal trade to her portfolio, said it won't be good if the Liberal government is not united as it deals with Trump's threats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve chatted with the prime minister a number of times. I believe this is a moment where we need to stand united,\" she said.",
      "There is no mechanism for Trudeau\u2019s party to force him out in the short term. He could say he will step aside when a new party leader is chosen, or his Liberal party could be forced from power by a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party",
      "Concerns about Trudeau\u2019s leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau\u2019s finance minister and deputy prime minister, resigned from the Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau\u2019s handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump.",

      "He says federal workers are worried not just about how long a potential shutdown could last, but also about what will happen after Trump takes office.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re fearful of what\u2019s to come, like this is the beginning of something, or they don\u2019t care about us,\" Zuagar said.",
      "Jesus Soriano, president of the AFGE Local 3403 representing workers at the National Science Foundation and several other agencies, also said the budget difficulties in Congress feel different from those of previous years.",
      "\u201cI think Americans should know that history is being written as we speak,\" Soriano said in an interview in Chevy Chase, Maryland, near the state's border with the nation's capital. \"Americans need to decide what type of services the government should provide, whether we are talking about national security, the safety of our borders, the safety of our food, Social Security or others.\u201d",
      "Anxiety about furloughs from a government shutdown this time could be a prelude, Soriano said.",
      "\u201cFederal employees that we represent in the American Federation of Government Employees are scared for the jobs, given the public discourse that we are all witnessing,\" Soriano said.",
      "Mac Johnson, a retired Transportation Security Administration employee who is now an executive vice president for the union's TSA Council, said TSA employees were on \u201cpins and needles\u201d Friday afternoon.",
      "Johnson said about half the TSA's workforce was on the job during the 2018 shutdown. While TSA employees would still work at the nation's airports during a shutdown, there's a chance they would not be paid until a government funding measure is approved.",
      "That's hard to bear when many employees live paycheck to paycheck.",
      "\u201cIt is a double whammy,\" Johnson said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. \"One, you\u2019re not getting paid, and I think it\u2019s going to affect the ability of any federal agency, not only TSA. You know, once upon a time, there was job security working for the federal government, but going through all of these shutdowns does not do a lot for the confidence of those potential candidates for future government employment.\u201d",
      "Zuagar said he's more confused about the budget debate this time around than in previous years.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is just all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these different factions of people.\u201d",
      "Government shutdowns not only are demoralizing to federal workers, Soriano said, but recovery takes a long time. For individuals, savings are depleted, spending is deferred and some things that once seemed necessary are suddenly out of reach.",
      "For government agencies, a lot has to be rebuilt.",
      "\u201cSo, it is not that the shutdown disappears, and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cIt takes time and effort to put a shutdown into place. It takes even more time to address all the deficiencies created by a shutdown.\u201d",
      "Despite the anxiety, Zuagar says he's avoiding blaming anyone specifically for the turbulent negotiations. For now, he's trying to be optimistic that what he's hearing is mostly rhetoric, and support for funding federal employees and the services they provide will be there.",
      "Still, he said it's \u201cshocking\u201d to be blindsided by a crisis right before the holiday. He said he would receive his last paycheck until the impasse is resolved this weekend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your last paycheck before Christmas, so for some of us, for myself, you\u2019ve got to think: Do I spend it on Christmas gifts for my family, or do I hold some of that?\u201d Zuagar said. \"Because we\u2019ve also got to pay our bills in January. It will affect people in the sense of how they spend this weekend.\u201d",
      "That's the kind of thing he wishes lawmakers would remember as they negotiate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s real people behind all this stuff, and our hope is that, you know, they think about that,\" Zuagar said.",

      "Big Lots has said that high inflation and interest rates have hurt its business as consumers have pulled back on their home and seasonal product purchases, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue.

      "Volkswagen\u2019s employee representatives say they have reached a wage deal",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Volkswagen and its employee representatives said Friday they have reached a wage deal for 120,000 German workers that avoids plant closings and bars involuntary layoffs through 2030. The agreement includes provisions for VW to shed more than 35,000 jobs through early retirement and buyouts by 2030.",
      "The deal, reached in drawn-out bargaining sessions that stretched late into the night, is aimed at enabling the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to cope with a drop in demand in Europe, higher raw-material costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.",
      "Lagging sales in Europe mean the company has lost potential sales of 500,000 cars a year, or the output of two factories.",
      "The deal would save VW 1.5 billion euros ($1.56 billion) a year in labor costs and 4 billion euros a year by slashing manufacturing capacity by more 700,000 vehicles across its German plants through different production arrangements.",
      "That the agreement avoids wholesale plant closings underscores the role played at Volkswagen by employee representatives and the state of Lower Saxony, who together have majority on the board of directors. That gives workers and the local government unusual leverage.",
      "A top Volkswagen executive called it \u201ca good agreement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had three priorities in the negotiations: reducing overcapacity in German locations, reducing labor costs and bringing development costs down to a competitive level,\u201d said Thomas Schaefer, head of the company's namesake Volkswagen brand.",
      "\u201cWe reached sustainable solutions in all three areas.\u201d",
      "Thorsten Groeger, negotiator for the IG Metall union, said employees also accepted \u201cpainful concessions.\" A union statement said that the loss of bonus payments and other compensation were part of the deal but that monthly wage levels would not be touched. The company had pressed for a 10% wage cut.",
      "Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America.",
      "Though major plant closings were avoided, a factory in Dresden will cease production at the end of next year as previous planned, and a plant in Osnabrueck is to produce T-Roc SUVs only through the middle of 2027. After those dates, the company will seek other uses for Osnabrueck. Top Volkswagen employee representative Daniela Cavallo said the Dresden plant could be repurposed \u201calso in cooperation with other organizations\u201d that she didn't specify.",
      "The company said it would move production of its Golf model from its home plant at Wolfsburg to Puebla, Mexico, and reduce the assembly lines at Wolfsburg from four to two that would produce the ID.3 and CUPRA Born compact cars. Some 4,000 vehicle development jobs would be dropped at Wolfsburg."

      "Italy\u2019s data protection authority says it has fined OpenAI $15.6 million after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by its generative artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT",
      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT.",
      "The country\u2019s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users\u2019 personal data to train ChatGPT \u201cwithout having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users\u201d.",
      "OpenAI dubbed the decision \u201cdisproportionate\u201d and said it will appeal.",
      "\u201cWhen the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. \u201cThey\u2019ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.\u201d",
      "OpenAI added, however, it remained \u201ccommitted to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.\u201d",
      "The investigation, launched last year, also found that OpenAI didn\u2019t provide an \u201cadequate age verification system\u201d to prevent users under 13 years of age from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content, the watchdog said.",
      "The Italian authority also ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month campaign on different Italian media to raise public awareness about ChatGPT, specifically in regard to data collection.",
      "The booming popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT has drawn scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been examining OpenAI and other companies that have played a key part in the AI boom, while governments around the world have been drawing up rules to protect against risks posed by AI systems, led by the European Union's AI Act, a comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence.",

    "summary": "Approaching a midnight deadline, the Senate is preparing to give final approval to a new plan to prevent a government shutdown",
    "story": [
      "Approaching a midnight deadline, the Senate is preparing to give final approval to a new plan to prevent a government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- Approaching a midnight government shutdown deadline, the Senate set up votes toward final passage late Friday of a new plan that would temporarily fund federal operations and disaster aid, but drops President-elect Donald Trump's demands for a debt limit increase into the new year.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson had insisted Congress would \u201cmeet our obligations\u201d and not allow federal operations to shutter ahead of the Christmas holiday season. But the day's outcome was uncertain after Trump doubled down on his insistence that a debt ceiling increase be included in any deal \u2014 if not, he said in an early morning post, let the closures \u201cstart now.\u201d",
      "The House approved Johnson's new bill overwhelmingly, 366-34. As the Senate worked into the night, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that senators had reached agreement that would skip past procedural hurdles and allow them to pass the funding bill \u201cbefore the midnight deadline.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a good outcome for the country, \u201d Johnson said after the House vote, adding he had spoken with Trump and the president-elect \u201cwas certainly happy about this outcome, as well.\u201d",
      "It was the third attempt from Johnson, the beleaguered House speaker, to achieve one of the basic requirements of the federal government \u2014 keeping it open. And it raised stark questions about whether Johnson will be able to keep his job, in the face of angry GOP colleagues, and work alongside Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk, who called the legislative plays from afar.",
      "President Joe Biden, who has played a less public role in the process throughout a turbulent week, was expected to quickly sign the measure into law.",
      "Trump's last-minute demand was almost an impossible ask, and Johnson had almost no choice but to work around his pressure for a debt ceiling increase. The speaker knew there wouldn\u2019t be enough support within the GOP majority to pass any funding package, since many Republican deficit hawks prefer to slash federal government and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow more debt.",
      "Instead, the Republicans, who will have full control of the White House, House and Senate next year, with big plans for tax cuts and other priorities, are showing they must routinely rely on Democrats for the votes needed to keep up with the routine operations of governing.",
      "\u201cSo is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?\u201d scoffed Musk on social media ahead of the vote.",
      "The drastically slimmed-down 118-page package would fund the government at current levels through March 14 and add $100 billion in disaster aid and $10 billion in agricultural assistance to farmers.",
      "Gone is Trump\u2019s demand to lift the debt ceiling, which GOP leaders told lawmakers would be debated as part of their tax and border packages in the new year. Republicans made a so-called handshake agreement to raise the debt limit at that time while also cutting $2.5 trillion in spending over 10 years.",
      "It\u2019s essentially the same deal that flopped the night before in a spectacular setback \u2014 opposed by most Democrats and some of the most conservative Republicans \u2014 minus Trump\u2019s debt ceiling demand.",
      "But it's far smaller than the original bipartisan accord Johnson struck with Democratic and Republican leaders \u2014 a 1,500-page bill that Trump and Musk rejected, forcing him to start over. It was stuffed with a long list of other bills \u2014 including much-derided pay raises for lawmakers \u2014 but also other measures with broad bipartisan support that now have a tougher path to becoming law.",
      "House Democrats were cool to the latest effort after Johnson reneged on the hard-fought bipartisan compromise.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said it looked like Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, was calling the shots for Trump and Republicans.",
      "\u201cWho is in charge?\u201d she asked during the debate.",
      "Still, the Democrats put up more votes than Republicans for the bill's passage. Almost three dozen conservative Republicans voted against it.",
      "\u201cThe House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy and hurting working-class Americans all across the nation,\u201d House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said after the vote, referring to Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan.",
      "Trump, who has not yet been sworn into office, is showing the power but also the limits of his sway with Congress, as he intervenes and orchestrates affairs from Mar-a-Lago alongside Musk, who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The incoming Trump administration vows to slash the federal budget and fire thousands of employees and is counting on Republicans for a big tax package. And Trump's not fearful of shutdowns the way lawmakers are, having sparked the longest government shutdown in history in his first term at the White House.",
      "\u201cIf there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now,\u201d Trump posted early in the morning on social media.",
      "More important for the president-elect was his demand for pushing the thorny debt ceiling debate off the table before he returns to the White House. The federal debt limit expires Jan. 1, and Trump doesn't want the first months of his new administration saddled with tough negotiations in Congress to lift the nation's borrowing capacity. Now Johnson will be on the hook to deliver.",
      "\u201cCongress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,\u201d Trump posted \u2014 increasing his demand for a new five-year debt limit increase. \"Without this, we should never make a deal.\"",
      "Government workers had already been told to prepare for a federal shutdown that would send millions of employees \u2014 and members of the military \u2014 into the holiday season without paychecks.",
      "Biden has been in discussions with Jeffries and Schumer, but White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \u201cRepublicans blew up this deal. They did, and they need to fix this.\u201d",
      "As the day dragged on, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stepped in to remind colleagues \u201chow harmful it is to shut the government down, and how foolish it is to bet your own side won\u2019t take the blame for it.\u201d",
      "At one point, Johnson asked House Republicans at a lunchtime meeting for a show of hands as they tried to choose the path forward.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the shutdown, but the speaker\u2019s job on the line. The speaker\u2019s election is the first vote of the new Congress, which convenes Jan. 3, and some Trump allies have floated Musk for speaker.",
      "Johnson said he spoke to Musk ahead of the vote Friday and they talked about the \u201cextraordinary challenges of this job.\u201d",

      "An inflation gauge that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve barely rose last month in a sign that price pressures cooled after two months of sharp gains",
      "WASHINGTON -- An inflation gauge that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve barely rose last month in a sign that price pressures cooled after two months of sharp gains.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the government showed that prices rose just 0.1% from October to November. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices also ticked up just 0.1%, after two months of outsize 0.3% gains.",
      "The milder inflation figures arrived two days after Federal Reserve officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, rocked financial markets by revealing that they now expect to cut their key interest rate just two times in 2025, down from four in their previous estimate. Stickier inflation, Powell said, \u201cmight be the single biggest factor\u201d causing the central bank to reduce the number of rate cuts it envisions. Fewer Fed rate cuts would likely mean that mortgage rates and other consumer borrowing costs would remain elevated.",
      "Yearly inflation was 2.4% in November, up from 2.3% in October and above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. Year-over-year \u201ccore\u201d prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, were unchanged at 2.8%.",
      "Inflation, according to the measure released Friday \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 has plummeted from a peak of 7.2% in June 2022 to 2.1% in September. The Fed's tool for fighting inflation is to steadily raise borrowing costs across the economy, which tends to cool spending and growth.",
      "policymakers revised their expectation for inflation by the end of 2025 to 2.5%, unchanged from its current rate. The officials still expect core prices to fall by the end of next year, also to 2.5%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s way below where it was but we really want to see (more) progress on inflation,\u201d Powell said at a news conference Wednesday. \u201cAs we think about further cuts, we\u2019re going to be looking for progress.\u201d",
      "The Fed did cut its benchmark rate Wednesday by a quarter point to about 4.3%, after its larger-than-usual half-point rate cut in September and a quarter-point reduction in November.",
      "The Fed tends to favor the PCE index over the better-known consumer price index. The PCE index tries to account for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps. It can capture, for example, when consumers switch from pricier national brands to cheaper store brands.",
      "In general, the PCE index tends to show a lower inflation rate than CPI. In part, that\u2019s because rents, which have been high, carry double the weight in the CPI.",

      "Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, pushed a bill to final passage through unanimous consent \u2014 a rarely successful procedure that allowed quick approval because no senator objected. It extends for five years a program at the National Institutes of Health to research pediatric cancer and other diseases.",

Some Republicans, along with Elon Musk, celebrated that as a victory, but Democrats singled out the pediatric cancer research funding as an example of the things they were cutting.",
      "The cancer research bill that gained final approval authorizes the program for a shorter period than congressional proponents had hoped, however, and other health research from the first funding proposal was still abandoned.",
      "The Senate is moving to a final vote on a proposal to boost Social Security payments for millions of people, potentially pushing a longtime priority for former public employees through Congress in one of its last acts for the year.",
      "The bipartisan bill would eliminate longtime reductions to Social Security benefits for nearly 3 million people who receive pensions because they worked in federal, state and local government, or public service jobs like teachers, firefighters and police officers.

      "The legislation has been decades in the making, but the push to pass it came together in the final weeks that lawmakers were in Washington before Congress resets next year. All Senate Democrats except one, as well as 23 Republicans, supported the effort to bring it to a final vote.",

Thomas Massie, a longtime critic of Johnson, told reporters his determination to oppose Johnson has only been cemented by the speaker\u2019s latest decision to depend on Democrats to pass a government funding bill.

      "Good of Virginia came out and said he would surprised if there was a vote Friday on any path forward. Moments later, Rep.

      "Crowds in Mayotte have vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing",
      "MIRERENI, Mayotte -- Crowds in Mayotte vented their frustration at French President Emmanuel Macron, with some booing, as he toured destruction wrought by the strongest cyclone to hit the French territory in nearly a century.",
      "Particularly tense scenes on Thursday underscored the discontent that many residents of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean feel toward their government, based about 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) away in Paris.",
      "The people of Mayotte, the poorest department in France, have previously said they suffer from underinvestment and neglect by the government. Now, they are expressing disappointment with the response to Cyclone Chido, which hit Saturday.",
      "The storm has devastated entire neighborhoods and caused an unknown number of deaths, as many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn\u2019t be so extreme. Authorities have said hundreds or possibly thousands may be dead, but the official toll rose to 35 on Friday.",
      "In the morning, Macron visited a neighborhood in Tsingoni on Mayotte\u2019s main island, where people remain without access to drinking water or phone service nearly a week after the storm.",
      "As he walked through the area, some shouted: \u201cWe want water, we want water.\u201d Others, however, offered him a warmer welcome, posing for selfies with the French leader and showing him their children.",
      "But the night before, Macron was met with boos from dozens of residents in Pamandzi on another nearby island.",
      "As people expressed frustration at the slow pace of aid efforts, Macron grabbed a microphone and became angry.",
      "Moving towards the crowd, he said: \u201cI have nothing to do with the cyclone, you can blame me, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d",
      "Macron, who is known for his appetite for debate and for confronting people who are angry at him, vacillated between acknowledging the hardship and pushing back against criticism.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve been through something terrible, everyone\u2019s struggling, regardless of skin color,\u201d he said.",
      "Visibly losing patience, Macron then shouted: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t France, you\u2019d be 10,000 times more screwed!\u201d",
      "The French president added: \u201cThere\u2019s no place in the Indian Ocean where people get so much help!\u201d A woman could be heard saying \u201cwe disagree.\u201d",
      "In a reflection of further frustration, a woman working with local authorities in Mayotte\u2019s capital told The Associated Press on Friday that many deaths recorded by officials on the ground have not yet been published in official tallies.",
      "The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, said most of the people who died were migrants, living in the hills in flimsy houses. Mayotte is home to 320,000 residents and an estimated 100,000 additional migrants.",
      "The woman was not able to give her own estimate.",
      "The reported death toll has only slowly ticked up in the week since the cyclone hit and stood at 35 on Friday, even though authorities have said they know that is a dramatic undercount.",
      "Many in Mayotte have expressed disbelief that the toll hasn\u2019t been updated more quickly.",
      "The Interior Ministry said Friday that in addition to the deaths, 67 people were seriously injured and more than 2,400 slightly injured.",
      "\u201cThe number of deaths does not reflect the reality of the 100,000 people living in precarious housing,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe prefect has therefore ordered the deputy prefect to set up a mission to search for the dead.\u201d",
      "It said 70% of residents were \u201cseriously affected.\u201d",
      "The government said it has created a way to count the dead by ordering a census of the population district by district, with the help of mayors and local associations.",
      "In just one example of how the toll might grow, French Health Minister Genevi\u00e8ve Darrieussecq said Friday that about 17% of hospital staff and 40% of all regional health staff on the archipelago are still unaccounted for.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s around 60 to 70 people,\u201d she said on news broadcaster FranceInfo, stressing a large part of the population still has no access to phone service.",
      "Meanwhile, French military and local authorities scrambled to repair busted water pipes across the islands and get water to villages who haven\u2019t had any.",
      "In the village of Mirereni, about 35 kilometers (20 miles) outside Mayotte\u2019s capital, Civil Security officers were trying to remove a large, felled mango tree that busted a water pipe.",
      "The pipe provides water to around 10,000 people in three nearby villages. But officials said repairing it might take longer than usual because of the heat, which impacts equipment.",
      "Locals said they\u2019re worried the lack of water would cause disease. Earlier this year, there was a cholera outbreak on the island, with at least 200 cases.",
      "Mayotte is part an archipelago located between Africa\u2019s east coast and Madagascar that had been a French colony. Its residents voted to remain part of France in a 1974 referendum while the rest of the islands became the independent nation of Comoros.",
      "In recent decades, the French territory has seen massive migration from Comoros, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, most of whom entered and live illegally in Mayotte.",
      "Macron said Friday fighting illegal immigration was key to state efforts to get Mayotte back on track.",
      "\u201cWhen you have schools where the population has multiplied by five in two years, when you have hospitals that are exploding under migration pressure, they feel they are being abandoned even if the state is doing a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to solve Mayotte\u2019s fundamental problems unless we solve the problem of illegal immigration.\u201d",
      "He has proposed rules that would apply to the territory in order to reduce the numbers of people coming in illegally.",
      "On Thursday, he also announced a special law that would help rebuild Mayotte more quickly and would seek to destroy slums and replace tin shacks with more solid buildings.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration says it is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 public service workers through an existing forgiveness program",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Joe Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through PSLF.",
      "\u201cFrom Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cBecause of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\u201d",
      "Still, the Democrat has fallen short of his goal to deliver widespread relief to millions of other Americans. Biden\u2019s first attempt at mass cancellation was blocked by the Supreme Court, and his second attempt remains tangled in a legal battle brought by Republican states.",
      "In October he proposed another rule that would cancel loans for people facing various kinds of financial hardship, though it's unlikely to take effect.",
      "Trump hasn't detailed student loan plans for his second term, but on the campaign trail he called Biden's cancellation plans illegal and \u201cvile.\u201d Republicans in Congress have slammed Biden over his cancellation work, saying it unfairly transfers the burden to taxpayers who didn't go to college or already repaid their loans.",

      "Workers at Starbucks stores plan to go on a five-day strike starting Friday to protest lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company",
      "Workers at Starbucks stores plan to go on a five-day strike starting Friday to protest lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "The strikes are scheduled to begin in Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle and could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The union noted that Starbucks' new Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job. But the company recently proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said.",
      "\u201cUnion baristas know their value, and they\u2019re not going to accept a proposal that doesn\u2019t treat them as true partners,\" said Lynne Fox, president of Workers United.",
      "Seattle-based Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. Starbucks has nearly 10,000 company-owned stores in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\u201d Starbucks said in a statement.",
      "Starbucks said it already offers pay and benefits \u2014 including free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "The strikes aren't the first during Starbucks' busy holiday season. In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, a day when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",
      "The union and the company struck a different tone early this year, when they returned to the bargaining table and pledged to reach an agreement. Starbucks said it has held nine bargaining sessions with the union since April, and has reached more than 30 agreements with the union.",
      "But the two sides now appear to be at an impasse.",
      "\u201cIn a year when Starbucks invested so many millions in top executive talent, it has failed to present the baristas who make its company run with a viable economic proposal,\u201d said Fatemeh Alhadjaboodi, a Starbucks barista from Texas and bargaining delegate, in a statement."

      "PARIS -- Pastry chef Arnaud Delmontel rolls out dough for croissants and pain au chocolat that later emerge golden and fragrant from the oven in his Paris patisserie.",
      "The price for the butter so essential to the pastries has shot up in recent months, by 25% since September alone, Delmontel says. But he is refusing to follow some competitors who have started making their croissants with margarine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a distortion of what a croissant is,\u201d Delmontel said. \"A croissant is made with butter.\u201d",
      "One of life\u2019s little pleasures \u2014 butter spread onto warm bread or imbuing cakes and seared meats with its rich flavor \u2014 has gotten more expensive across Europe in the last year. After a stretch of post-pandemic inflation that the war in Ukraine worsened, the booming cost of butter is another blow for consumers with holiday treats to bake.",
      "Across the 27-member European Union, the price of butter rose 19% on average from October 2023 to October 2024, including by 49% in Slovakia, and 40% in Germany and the Czech Republic, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the EU's executive arm. Reports from individual countries indicate the cost has continued to go up in the months since.",
      "In Germany, a 250-gram (8.8-ounce) block of butter now generally costs between 2.40 and 4 euros ($2.49-$4.15), depending on the brand and quality.",
      "The increase is the result of a global shortage of milk caused by declining production, including in the United States and New Zealand, one of the world\u2019s largest butter exporters, according to economist Mariusz Dziwulski, a food and agricultural market analyst at PKO Bank Polski in Warsaw.",
      "European butter typically has a higher fat content than the butter sold in the United States. It also is sold by weight in standard sizes, so food producers can\u2019t hide price hikes by reducing package sizes, something known as \u201cshrinkflation. \u201d",
      "A butter shortage in France in the 19th century led to the invention of margarine, but the French remain some of the continent's heaviest consumers of butter, using the ingredient with abandon in baked goods and sauces.",
      "Butter is so important in Poland that the government keeps a stockpile of it in the country's strategic reserves, as it does national gas and COVID-19 vaccines. The government announced Tuesday that it was releasing some 1,000 tons of frozen butter to stabilize prices.",
      "The price of butter rose 11.4% between early November and early December in Poland, and 49.2% over the past year to nearly 37 Polish zlotys, or $9 per kilo (2.2 pounds) for the week ending Dec. 8, according to the National Support Center for Agriculture, a government agency.",
      "\u201cEvery month butter gets more expensive,\u201d Danuta Osinska, a 77-year-old Polish woman, said while shopping recently at a discount grocery chain in Warsaw.",
      "She and her husband love butter \u2014 on bread, in scrambled eggs, in creamy desserts. But they also struggle to pay for medications on their meager pensions. So the couple is eating less butter and more margarine, even though they find the taste of the substitute spread inferior.",
      "\u201cThere is no comparison,\u201d Osinska said. \u201cThings are getting harder and harder.\u201d",
      "The cost of butter in Poland has become a political issue. With a presidential election scheduled next year, opponents of centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk are trying to blame him and his Civic Platform party. Other Poles want to blame the national bank's governor, who hails from an opposing political camp.",
      "Some consumers decide where to shop based on the price of butter, which has led to price wars between grocery chains that in some cases kept prices artificially low in the past to the detriment of dairy farmers, according to Agnieszka Maliszewska, the director of the Polish Chamber of Milk.",
      "Maliszewska thinks domestic, EU-specific and global issues explain butter inflation. She argues that the primary cause in Poland is a shortage of milk fat due to dairy farmers shutting down their enterprises because of slim profit markets and hard work.",
      "She and others also cite higher energy costs from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine as impacting milk production. There is some debate about the potential effect of climate change. Maliszewska doesn't see a link.",
      "Economist Dziwulski, however, thinks droughts may be a factor in reducing production. Falling milk prices last year also discouraged investments and pushed dairy producers in the EU to make more cheese, which offered better profitability, he said.",
      "An outbreak of bluetongue disease, an insect-borne viral disease that is harmless to humans but can be fatal for sheep, cows and goats, may also play a role, Dziwulski said.",
      "The U.S. saw a butter price spike in 2022, when the average price jumped 33% to $4.88 per pound over the course of the year, according to government data. Dairy farmers struggled with feed costs and hot temperatures.",
      "U.S. butter prices fell in 2023 before rising again this year, hitting a peak of $5 per pound in September. Higher grocery prices in general weighed on U.S. voters during the presidential election in November.",
      "Southern European countries, which rely far more heavily on olive oil, are less affected by the butter inflation \u2014 or they just don't consider it as important since they consume so much less.",
      "Since last year the cost of butter shot up 44% on average in Italy, according to dairy market analysis firm CLAL. Italy is Europe's seventh-largest butter producer, but olive oil is the preferred fat, even for some desserts. The price of butter therefore is not causing the same alarm there as it is in butter-addicted parts of Europe.",
      "Delmontel, the Paris pastry chef, said the rising costs put business owners like him under pressure. Along with refusing to switch out butter for margarine, he has not reduced the size of his croissants. But some other French bakers are making smaller pastries to control costs, he said.",
      "\u201cOr else you squeeze it out of your profit margin,\u201d Delmontel said.",

      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year\u2019s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\u201cWhen they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\u201d said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\u201cThey will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\u201d TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \u201ccontinue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\u201d spokesperson Diaz said. \u201cAirport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\u201d",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\u201cBecause travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\u201d Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \u201cIf you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\"",

      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, said the entire city will benefit from what she called a \u201chistoric game-changing economic development project,\u201d according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.",
      "Supporters hope the 18,500-seat arena can help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.",

      "They vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they are free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would pay about $6 million in annual Payments in Lieu of Taxes.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s role in taking down a bipartisan budget deal shows his ascendance as a political force",
      "In the first major flex of his influence since Donald Trump was elected, Elon Musk brought to a sudden halt a bipartisan budget proposal by posting constantly on his X megaphone and threatening Republicans with primary challenges.",
      "The social media warnings from the world's wealthiest man preceded Trump's condemnation of a measure negotiated by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, which effectively killed the stopgap measure that was designed to prevent a partial shutdown of the federal government.",
      "Washington was scrambled a day after Musk's public pressure campaign. Trump on Thursday declined to say if he had confidence in Johnson, telling NBC News, \u201cWe'll see.\u201d And there was no clear path to keeping the government open beyond Friday, raising the specter of a government shutdown heading into the holidays. Congressional Democrats mocked their GOP counterparts, with several suggesting Trump had been relegated to vice president.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the Elon Musk presidency,\u201d Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California wrote on X.",
      "What was clear, though, is Musk\u2019s ascendance as a political force, a level of influence enabled by his great wealth. In addition to owning X, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and Space X.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt he does wield a lot of influence over Republicans right now due to his proximity to Trump,\u201d said Chris Pack, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund.",
      "But Pack also said that Musk's threats pose potential risks for House Republicans, who begin next year with a five-seat majority that will shrink temporarily because of Trump\u2019s nomination of some GOP lawmakers to administration posts.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to help pass the agenda if you are going to cost a bunch of Republicans in very razor-thin moderate seats if you\u2019re going to make them lose in primaries,\u201d Pack said. \u201cAll that does is give the keys to these districts over to the Democrats.\u201d",
      "Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, contributing heavily to America PAC, a super political action committee that deployed canvassers, aired TV ads and reached voters digitally in battleground states. He had signaled after the election he was willing to back GOP primary challenges to Republican members of Congress seeking re-election in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "He renewed the threat pointedly Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAny member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!\u201d he wrote on X. He also called it \u201cone of the worst bills ever written.\u201d",
      "Musk wasn't alone in fanning GOP anger against the bill, which included several compromise measures to get Democratic support in the Senate in the final weeks before Republicans take control of that chamber. Biotech entrepreneur and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who is Musk\u2019s partner leading the new Department of Government Efficiency, also posted against the bill, as did Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.",
      "Musk played down his role at times, suggesting after some praise online, \u201cAll I can do is bring things to the attention of the people, so they may voice their support if they so choose.\u201d And the president-elect told NBC News that he had spoken to Musk prior to the Tesla CEO's first posts.",
      "\u201cI told him that if he agrees with me, that he could put out a statement,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the incoming White House press secretary, pushed back against Democratic critics who suggested Musk was calling the shots.",
      "\u201cAs soon as President Trump released his official stance on the CR, Republicans on Capitol Hill echoed his point of view,\" Leavitt said in a statement, referring to the continuing resolution. \"President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party. Full stop.\u201d",
      "Throughout the day Wednesday, Musk replied to posts on X from Republican House members announcing opposition to the bill with words of thanks, and punctuating their public commitments.",
      "And he took a victory lap after Trump came out against the bill: \u201cThe voice of the people was heard. This was a good day for America.\"",
      "He was responding to Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr's post: \u201cThe phone was ringing off the hook today. And you know why? Because they were reading tweets...from Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\u201d",
      "Conservative activists at the annual AmericaFest gathering in Phoenix cheered Musk Thursday and hailed the suggestion he could replace Johnson as speaker. There\u2019s no requirement that the speaker be an elected member of the House of Representatives.",
      "\u201cShould Mike Johnson remain speaker of the House?\u201d conservative media host Jack Posobiec asked his audience during a live taping of his talk show, prompting a chorus of \u201cNoooooo!!!\u201d from his audience.",
      "Johnson had been scheduled to attend AmericaFest, but canceled after the budget deal fell apart.",
      "\u201cShould Elon Musk be speaker of the House?\u201d Posobiec asked his audience, prompting cheers.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- American farmers, small business owners and wildfire survivors are among those who will suffer if Congress cannot agree on a new spending bill after President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected a bipartisan plan that included more than $100 billion in disaster aid.",
      "A mayor in Hawaii is watching closely to see what happens because a potential allocation of $1.6 billion in funding is on the line. It's critical to ongoing disaster recovery efforts from the 2023 Maui fire, which proved to be the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.",
      "\u201cI think what funding does is provides people with hope so they can plan for their future,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cAnd the longer we go without funding, the longer people wallow and wonder, is there a chance? Is there a path? Do I cut my losses? Do I leave?\u201d",
      "While money from the Federal Emergency Management Administration has provided temporary relief, the disaster recovery funding was intended for long-term needs such as housing assistance and rebuilding infrastructure, he said. The historic town of Lahaina is still struggling after the August 2023 fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes, leaving behind an estimated $5.5 billion in damage.",
      "The money is also urgently needed after Hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the southeastern United States one after the other this fall. Helene alone was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, killing at least 221 people. Nearly half were in North Carolina where flooding and winds caused an estimated $60 billion in damage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tracking this bill like a hawk right now, to be honest,\u201d Asheville Tea Co. founder and CEO Jessie Dean said. \u201cI think a lot of us are.\u201d",
      "Flooding from Helene in September washed away the company's building along with all of its equipment and inventory. Her small business employs 11 people directly and also works with small farmers in the area to supply the herbs for its teas.",
      "On Thursday, Republicans released a new version of the bill to keep the government operating and restore the disaster aid, but it faced an uncertain pathway. While President-elect Donald Trump lauded the revised plan, Democratic legislative leaders indicated they were opposed. Some Democratic support would likely be needed in the face of opposition by hardline members of the GOP.",
      "\u201cI realize there are other distractions that are going on, but I would just bring everybody back to their commitment to help disaster survivors,\u201d said Bissen, Maui's mayor. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really all this is. We have a proven and established, legitimate disaster that took place. And we are coming up on 16 months, which no other disasters ever had to wait that long for.\u201d",
      "In Asheville, Dean is extremely grateful for support the business has received from customers and nonprofits that is helping it stay afloat right now, but more is needed. So far she has received no money from the U.S. Small Business Administration after applying for a disaster relief loan. Neither have any of the other business owners she knows.",
      "\u201cIn day to day life right now, I'm talking to friends every day who are struggling with the decision around whether or not to continue to run their business, whether or not they can,\" she said.",
      "Many farmers are in the same boat, since about $21 billion of the disaster aid in the earlier version of the bill was assistance for them.",
      "\u201cWithout federal disaster money right now, or without some assistance, people like me will not be farming much longer,\u201d Georgia pecan farmer Scott Hudson said. He farms 2,600 acres (1,050 hectares) of pecans across five counties in southeastern Georgia that were hammered by Hurricane Helene.",
      "\u201cWe lost thousands of trees that will be decades before they are back to where they were the night before the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we lost upwards to 70% of the crop in certain counties.\u201d",
      "Some of his fellow farmers fared even worse.",
      "\u201cWhether you\u2019re a Democrat or Republican, the farmers need this money,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican ag needs this money ... not to be profitable, to just stay in business.\u201d",
      "People like retired engineer Thomas Ellzey are also counting on disaster aid. He has been living in a mud-filled house in Fairview, North Carolina, for almost three months. Although he pre-qualified for a low-interest loan from the SBA that helps homeowners rebuild, officials have told him the agency does not have the money and is waiting on Congress to act.",
      "Ellzey is 71 years old and said he budgeted carefully for his retirement, trying to prepare for every possible emergency that could come up once he stopped working. But he couldn\u2019t have predicted a hurricane, he said.",
      "\u201cEverything I owned was paid for, including my cars, the house, the land. I had no bills,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing back in debt is kind of rough at my age.\u201d",
      "The earlier version of the spending bill included included funding for low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster; money for rebuilding damaged roads and highways; and funds for helping communities recover through block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The block grant money is one of the key funds for homeowners who don\u2019t have insurance or enough insurance recover from disasters.",
      "Although hurricanes Helene and Milton are the most recent large natural disasters to hit the U.S., a lot of the money was intended more generally for relief from any major disaster in recent years, including droughts and wildfires.",
      "Stan Gimont is senior adviser for community recovery at Hagerty Consulting who used to run the community development block grant program at HUD. He noted that the country is still paying for disasters that happened while it simultaneously prepares for events that will happen in the future.",
      "The Maui fire is a clear example.",
      "\u201cIt took a year to clean that up and to get it to a point where they have removed all the debris, all the toxic materials and the burned up cars, whatever was in those houses,\u201d Gimont said. \u201cSo even though that event occurred in the past, the bills for that are going to come due in the future.\u201d",

      "Packaged foods in the U.S. will have to follow new rules in order to call themselves \u201chealthy,\u201d according to changes finalized Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",
      "The change banishes foods such as sugary cereals, highly sweetened yogurts, white bread and some granola bars from bearing a \u201chealthy\u201d label, while allowing foods such as avocados, olive oil, salmon, eggs and some trail mix to use it. Even water can now be labeled as healthy, the agency said.",
      "\u201cIt's critical for the future of the country that food be a vehicle for wellness,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said in a statement. \u201cImproving access to nutrition information is an important public health effort the FDA can undertake to help people build healthy eating patterns.\u201d",
      "The new rule will take effect within two months and food manufacturers will have until February 2028 to comply. A label that designates certain foods as healthy is still being developed, FDA officials said. Under the previous rule, about 15% of products were eligible for the healthy designation, but only 5% made the claim.",
      "First proposed in 2022, the change is a much-needed update to \u201chorribly outdated\u201d guidance, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University.",
      "\u201cBig picture, this is a huge improvement from a 30-year-old outdated definition based on 40-year-old science,\u201d he said.",
      "The new rule acknowledges that dietary and nutrition knowledge has progressed over three decades and that the previous definition didn\u2019t jibe with dietary guidelines that are the cornerstone of federal programs and policies.",
      "Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group, said that the new rule \u201cstands to exclude some packaged foods, despite countless years of industry innovation to provider healthier options.\u201d",
      "Sarah Gallo, an official for the group, said it is concerned the new rule \u201cis not based on clear and unambiguous scientific evidence\u201d and doesn't fully consider the full potential economic impact on consumers.",
      "The updated criteria are based on data that could improve public health, including diet-related chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes, the FDA said.",
      "More than three-quarters of Americans have diets low in vegetables, fruit and dairy, according to the FDA. Nearly 80% exceed limits on saturated fat, more than 60% exceed limits on added sugars and about 90% exceed limits on sodium that can reduce chronic disease.",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's ambitious reality show, which the YouTube megastar hopes will expand his giant online reach and turn the corner on recent controversies, is already raising questions from consumer advocates over a partnership with a fintech company.",
      "Prime Video's Thursday premiere of the record-setting \u201cBeast Games\" capped off a tumultuous year for Jimmy Donaldson and his production company. Shortly after reaching never-before-seen YouTube subscriber totals, MrBeast began facing heightened scrutiny over past \u201cinappropriate content,\u201d the channel's philanthropic efforts, its workplace culture and allegations of dangerous on-set conditions that Donaldson has denied.",
      "As MrBeast's loyal following tunes in to watch 1,000 contestants compete for $5 million on \u201cBeast Games,\" they are invited to scan a QR code during the show for a shot at winning their own life-changing money. It's a $4.2 million sweepstakes run by fintech company MoneyLion, an app that sends cash advances \u2014 often for a fee to workers living paycheck to paycheck.",
      "The collaboration is billed as a way for MrBeast, who has sought to regain brand trust in recent interviews with alternative media personalities, to give back to his fanbase while presenting them with MoneyLion's personal finance tools. But consumer advocates warn MoneyLion's early payments \u2014 which are also promoted to giveaway entrants \u2014 operate as payday loans that could trap needy users in earnings-depleting borrowing cycles with additional fees.",
      "Watchdogs find that those services are not recommendable for younger audiences, making it an unusual partner for MrBeast to introduce to his persuadable fandom.",
      "\u201cThese types of high-cost, fintech payday loans, wrapped up in fancy apps, just put people in a debt trap where they have to borrow this week\u2019s pay to pay last week\u2019s loan and sets them back in their financial goals,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, a director at the National Consumer Law Center who specializes in small dollar lending.",
      "\u201cBeast Games\u201d marks Donaldson\u2019s crossover into television entertainment. The North Carolina native has already captured online attention spans with his highly-produced, fast-paced YouTube videos that often feature absurd stunts and massive cash sums; \"Beat Ronaldo, Win $1,000,000\u201d recently pit professional athletes against amateurs in their respective sports.",
      "He's now testing the broad appeal of those viral spectacles with a competition series that promises \u201cnail-biting, physical, mental, and social challenges\u201d similar to Netflix's fictional survival drama \u201cSquid Game.\" The $5 million prize is believed to be the largest in reality television history and Donaldson posted recently that he spent $14 million alone \u201cbuilding a city in a field\u201d for the contestants.",
      "MoneyLion's partnership will bring \u201cfans closer to the action than ever before,\u201d according to a company press release. Over 1,000 prizes will be awarded to MoneyLion accountholders across eight drawings over the next year. Additional entries can be earned through daily log-ins on the MoneyLion app, where users are promised exclusive, behind-the-scenes content from the series. Consistent with sweepstakes law, participants must be legal U.S. residents ages 18 or older.",
      "Upon entering the giveaway, a popup asks, \u201cWant more ways to get money?\u201d with an invitation to borrow money through MoneyLion's loan services. Consumer watchdogs say cash advancements can come with steep costs despite casting themselves as \u201cno interest\" loans.",
      "Users must pay a sliding \u201cturbo\u201d fee to get their \u201cInstacash\u201d advancements \u201cwithin minutes\" instead of waiting the 2-5 days that MoneyLion estimates it would otherwise take to hit an external checking account. The company charges $8.99 for the maximum advance of $100.",
      "That makes MoneyLion one of the \u201cmore expensive options in this market,\u201d according to Center for Responsible Lending Senior Policy Counsel Andrew Kushner. Considering the products are geared toward cash-strapped people who need money now, Kushner said most users end up paying the fees.",
      "These apps create a \u201ccycle of borrowing\u201d as financially vulnerable users try to keep up with the \u201cextremely high cost of the loan relative to the size,\u201d according to Kushner. The Center for Responsible Lending found that users of these apps experienced a 56% increase in checking account overdrafts. Borrowers who use these \u201cearned wage access\" services withdrew 36 times a year, according to a 2021 California Department of Financial Protection report.",
      "A 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau lawsuit alleges that MoneyLion misled users to believe they could easily end monthly memberships necessary to access some installment loans but then refused to cancel those with outstanding loans.",
      "A representative for MrBeast declined to comment. In an emailed statement, a MoneyLion spokesperson said the company pairs financial tools and products to support \u201clong-term financial health and stability\u201d \u2014 all of which will be promoted to Beast Games Giveaway participants. MoneyLion said it will \u201ccontinue to collaborate with regulatory bodies\u201d including CFPB, according to the spokesperson, and focus on ensuring its products are \u201caccessible, fair, and designed to create the best outcomes for our customers.\u201d",
      "Its \u201cInstacash\u201d fees are \u201cclearly disclosed,\u201d the spokesperson wrote, and the service helps workers \u201cbreak the traditional payroll cycle\u201d to \u201cmeet unexpected financial obligations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Beast Games Giveaway is designed exclusively for an 18+ audience and represents a groundbreaking way to combine engaging content with accessible financial education,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThrough this collaboration, participants gain exposure to MoneyLion\u2019s diverse marketplace of financial products, tools, and content.\u201d",
      "Saunders, the consumer protection lawyer, said some lenders provide financial wellness tools that are really just \u201csugarcoating\u201d their high-cost loans.",
      "It's \u201cconcerning,\u201d according to Kushner, to advertise such a service toward younger adults who are still developing their sense of financial responsibility and are more susceptible to \u201cthe slick marketing of this industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can see at 18 (years old) how that could be a really exciting thing to have in front of you,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cBut it can really have negative consequences once you go down the pathway of using it.\u201d",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose this week to its highest level since late November, reflecting a recent uptick in the bond yields that lenders use as a guide to price home loans.",
      "The rate rose to 6.72% from 6.6% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. The rate is now higher than it was a year ago, when it averaged 6.67%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan to a lower rate, also rose this week. The average rate increased to 5.92% from 5.84% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.95%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage is now the highest it's been since Nov. 27, when it was at 6.81%.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market remains in a slump and on track for its worst year since 1995.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the moves in the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds.",
      "Bond yields shot up Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled that it will likely deliver fewer cuts to rates next year than it forecast just a few months ago. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The yield, which was below 3.7% as recently as September, was at 4.56% in midday trading Thursday.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:42:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Nearly 3 million people could receive a boost in Social Security payments under legislation that's set for a final vote in the Senate",

      "Nearly 3 million people could receive a boost in Social Security payments under legislation that's set for a final vote in the Senate",
      "ATLANTA -- Nearly 3 million people could receive a boost in Social Security payments under legislation set for a final Senate vote in the coming days.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would end longtime provisions that reduce the federal benefit for people who are also eligible for other pensions. The policies have heavily affected people who worked in state, local and federal government jobs, as well as teachers, firefighters and police officers, according to lawmakers and advocates.",
      "The bill has bipartisan support but has drawn some criticism from some conservatives. The House approved the measure in November by a vote of 327-75 and the bill easily cleared its first hurdle in the Senate on Wednesday. Its backers hope the Senate will vote to send the legislation to President Joe Biden before lawmakers\u2019 lame-duck session gives way to the new Congress in January.",
      "Here is more on what the bill would mean:",
      "The bill would repeal two provisions that limit Social Security benefits for certain recipients based on retirement payments they get from other sources \u2014 most often, but not exclusively, a public retirement program of a state or local government.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision modifies the usual benefit formula for retirees or disabled workers who are entitled to pension payments based on earnings from jobs that were not covered by Social Security.",
      "The details vary person to person but the idea, broadly, is that a monthly benefit is reduced by an amount tied to how much that person is receiving from a pension program in which they enrolled in lieu of paying Social Security payroll taxes.",
      "The Government Pension Offset follows a similar principle. It limits Social Security spousal benefits (those paid to a spouse based on their living spouse\u2019s work and payroll tax history) and the widow\u2019s or widower\u2019s benefits (paid after a spouse\u2019s death). Reductions are based on pension benefits for a retired federal, state or local government worker who opted out of some or all Social Security taxes and instead paid into another public retirement insurance program.",
      "Current law establishes the offset at two-thirds of an alternative pension payment.",
      "Under that standard, for example, a retired public health nurse might receive a $1,500 monthly disbursement from a state retirement system that does not participate in Social Security. Then, if that person becomes eligible to receive a spouse's Social Security benefit after the spouse's death, that survivor's Social Security benefit would be reduced by $1,000 each month.",
      "Social Security is commonly understood as a universal system in which everyone participates by paying Social Security payroll taxes and later getting benefits. But federal law has carved out exceptions. Generally, there are a few job categories that can be exempted and, thus, trigger benefit offsets:",
      "\u2014 Civilian federal employees hired before 1984 are covered under the Civil Service Retirement System instead of Social Security. Federal workers hired since 1984 are covered under a different federal retirement structure that requires those employees participate in Social Security.",
      "\u2014 State and local government employees who participate in their jurisdictions\u2019 retirement systems that allow them to opt out of Social Security.",
      "\u2014 Railroad workers who are covered under a separate federal insurance program.",
      "\u2014 Some clergy who can opt out.",
      "The Congressional Research Service estimates that in December 2023, there were 745,679 people, about 1% of all Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits reduced by the Government Pension Offset. About 2.1 million people, or about 3% of all beneficiaries, were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision.",
      "The largest category of existing workers whose future benefits could be affected are the state and local government employees.",
      "There are additional people still in the workforce whose future benefits would be affected. CRS estimated that in 2022, about 6.6 million, or 28% of the nation\u2019s state and local government workers, were not covered in the Social Security system. So as those people retire they could become eligible to get money from Social Security that they would not receive without the changes.",
      "The current proposal calls for changes to payments for January 2024 and beyond. If Congress sticks to that timeline, that means the Social Security Administration would owe back-dated payments.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimates that eliminating the Windfall Elimination Provision would boost monthly payments to the affected beneficiaries by an average of $360 by December 2025.",
      "The CBO estimates that ending the Government Pension Offset would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses. The increase would be an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",
      "All those amounts would increase over time with Social Security\u2019s regular cost-of-living adjustments.",
      "For the Social Security program, the expected net spending increase from 2024-34 is about $198 billion. Separately, the changes would yield an estimated $2 billion in savings for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program because those food aid payments would be reduced for some households whose Social Security income increases.",
      "That would mean added fiscal strain on the Social Security Trust funds, which already were estimated to be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. The cost was a reason some House conservatives tried to block the bill. Supporters acknowledged the fiscal impact but said it was a matter of fairness.",
      "It depends.",
      "The proposals moving on Capitol Hill are straightforward: \u201cThe Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust primary insurance amounts to the extent necessary to take into account\u201d changes in the law. And the Social Security Administration, through income tax filings, has everyone\u2019s earnings history used to calculate monthly benefit payments under the laws and formulas that Congress sets.",
      "But it's not immediately clear how easily the Social Security Administration could adjust payments for a few million people \u2014 whether it could be managed mostly by automated systems recalculating or whether it would require federal employees individually reviewing individual cases with beneficiaries.",
      "Additionally, the proposed changes to the spousal benefits could create newly eligible beneficiaries who are not currently getting such payments and could have to apply specifically for the benefit. The CBO estimates about 70,000 new beneficiaries by the end of 2033.",
      "Also, recipients with complicated formulas \u2013 including those that change as Congress tinkers with the law \u2013 can sometimes see errors in their payments when they have been automatically recalculated. Backdated payments can be especially problematic.",
      "The Social Security Administration has extensive Q&As and recipient services on its website: ssa.gov. For example, one can calculate how their additional pensions can affect their benefits under current law using this tool. But the agency has not yet addressed the pending legislation publicly.",
      "The agency also operates a toll-free hotline \u2014 1-800-772-1213 \u2014 and will schedule in-person meetings at one of hundreds of Social Security offices around the country.",
      "The Social Security Administration has a diminished staff after Congress has for years declined to fund the agency at its requested levels, even as the baby boomer generation ages and adds to the workload. Complex changes from Congress could create or exacerbate backlogs for recipients trying to get the precise benefits required under the law."

      "Top soccer players have had enough",
      "MANCHESTER, England -- One of the most striking moments of soccer in 2024 was when Rodri hobbled onto a stage in Paris on crutches to receive the prestigious Ballon d\u2019Or for best male player of the year.",
      "The Manchester City and Spain midfielder had been one of the most outspoken critics against the increasingly congested soccer calendar, warning that the lack of downtime was detrimental to players\u2019 performance and health. Then, just a month before the Oct. 28 award ceremony, he tore his ACL during a seemingly routine run in a Premier League game against Arsenal.",
      "Though such injuries have occurred throughout the history of the sport and aren\u2019t necessarily linked to overplaying, Rodri\u2019s season-ending injury became a visual representation of the physical toll of modern soccer at a time when the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "Top footballers are now routinely playing more than 60 games per season for club and country, while the game is getting faster and more intense. Injuries are on the rise. Already pushed to their limits, some players say FIFA\u2019s newly expanded Club World Cup, to be held in the United States next year, is the last straw.",
      "Players say they are \u201cat breaking point, that they are at the limit, that it\u2019s actually too much,\u201d Alexander Bielefeld, from global players\u2019 union FIFPRO, told The Associated Press.",
      "The new Club World Cup is a supersized version of what used to be a short tournament with only seven teams. The new edition includes 32 teams from around the world and will be held every four years, starting next summer in the United States from June 14 to July 13. As its name suggests, it\u2019s envisioned to be club version of the World Cup for national teams.",
      "That means top players will have a monthlong tournament on top of their domestic league season three out of every four years. With more games also added to the Champions League in Europe this season as well as the next World Cup in 2026, the soccer calendar is filling up quickly.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that worries us because we are the guys who suffer,\u201d Rodri said in September, just days before he was injured. He said players may have no choice but to refuse to play if the trend continues.",
      "He\u2019s not the only one feeling frustrated.",
      "In a post on X last year, Raphael Varane, a member of France's World Cup winning squad in 2018, said the schedule was putting players\u2019 physical and mental well-being at risk.",
      "\u201cWhy are our opinions not being heard?\u201d asked the 31-year-old Varane, who retired from the national team two years ago and from playing altogether in September this year following an injury.",
      "In July, England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham described the schedule as \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult on the body \u2014 mentally and physically you are exhausted,\u201d he said after England was runner-up at the European Championship.",
      "FIFPRO says a significant number of players routinely play 60-70 matches a season. The union's recommended limit is 55.",
      "Last season Julian Alvarez played 75 games for former club Manchester City and Argentina in 10 different competitions spanning the Premier League, Champions League, Copa America and Olympics.",
      "The season before, Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes played 70 times, including a run of 20 consecutive games.",
      "The Men\u2019s European Football Injury Index, an annual report by global insurance broker Howden, found there were 4,123 injuries in the top divisions of England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France last season. It said the number of injuries had risen year-on-year since the index was first published in 2021 and that \u201cit would be fair to expect a continuation of this upwards trajectory.\u201d",
      "Tony Strudwick, medical director for West Bromwich Albion and former head of performance for Manchester United, said injuries are on the rise despite advancements in sports science and medicine.",
      "\u201cThat to me looks like there\u2019s a mismatch between what the players can physically tolerate and what they\u2019ve been exposed to,\u201d he told The AP. \u201cDuring the last eight seasons, incidents of hamstring injuries, in particular, have increased.\u201d",
      "Strudwick said the risk of too many games was ultimately injury and burnout. But he said players are unlikely to raise the issue with their clubs or national teams.",
      "\u201cPlayers are very reluctant to say they don\u2019t want to play and they\u2019re very, very tired. It takes a relatively brave person to do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Manchester City played 61 games in the 2022-23 campaign when it won a trophy treble of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.",
      "This season that number could rise to 71 because of an expanded group stage and potential playoff in the Champions League and the Club World Cup.",
      "A heavy workload is also an issue in women\u2019s soccer, FIFPRO said earlier this week, though it noted that while some top players have a packed schedule, others don\u2019t get to play enough.",
      "If successful, the Club World Cup could rival the Premier League and Champions League as one of the most lucrative and watched tournaments in club soccer. It has been backed by clubs and next year\u2019s event is set to feature many of the biggest names in the sport, including Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Jr.",
      "Coming at the end of many leagues\u2019 regular season, FIFA said the dates would be \u201charmoniously aligned with the international match calendar\u201d to ensure sufficient rest for players ahead of the start of domestic campaigns.",
      "The governing body has also set up a player welfare task force to be led by former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.",
      "FIFPRO, which says it represents more than 66,000 players around the world, is not convinced. In October, its European division teamed up with domestic leagues and filed a legal complaint in Europe against how FIFA adds new and bigger men\u2019s competitions to the calendar.",
      "FIFA hit back, noting that European clubs often fill their summer breaks with exhibition matches around the world. It accused some European leagues of acting with \u201chypocrisy, and without consideration to everyone else in the world.\u201d",
      "Gelson Fernandes, a Swiss former player who now works for FIFA with the title Director Member Associations Africa, said that calendar congestion is an issue only for a limited number of players who consistently go deep into tournaments with their clubs and countries. Rodri, who won Euro 2024 with Spain this year, and Alvarez, who helped Argentina triumph at the last World Cup, are two such high-profile examples.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a small group of players, that minimum percentage of them, which are affected,\u201d Fernandes told The AP. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we should stop a competition which will give dreams and hopes to millions and billions of people around the world for that.\u201d",

      "In regular-season games going back to the start of the 2023-24 season, the Thunder are 79-30 overall and 35-20 on the road \u2014 both of those marks second-best in the NBA behind only Boston, the reigning league champs. They were the No. 1 seed for the Western Conference playoffs last season. They're in the No. 1 spot in the West so far this season.",
      "\u201cWe do whatever it takes to win,\u201d Thunder star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said.",
      "And now, they're finally going home. Most teams, if they played in Miami and don't have the second night of a back-to-back awaiting, stay over after visiting the Heat. Not the Thunder. They just played nine out of their last 11 games in places other than Oklahoma City, and they were more than ready to head back to familiar surroundings Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe didn't want to make any excuse,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe, I like to say, have the best jobs in the world. It sounds crazy but it's a little bit spoiled. We play basketball two nights in a row and get paid to do so. We have an amazing opportunity. We're blessed to be in this position.\u201d",
      "They've won seven in a row (the NBA Cup final loss doesn't count) for the second time this season. Gilgeous-Alexander is one of four players averaging more than 30 points per game so far. They're on pace for more steals than any team in the last 30 years. And they're doing it all without a single player currently older than 30.",
      "\u201cThese guys are monsters competitively,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cWe've done a good job. We've been on the road nine days. We had off days in Vegas and the guys did a great job of kind of putting money in the bank there physically, so that we were ready to play and exert energy and kind of play for the long haul. They did a great job on the trip to prepare for tonight. And now we're excited to get back home.\u201d",
      "Jalen Williams confirmed that. The riser in the Heat postgame interview room that the Thunder were using Friday night is about 18 inches off the floor. Williams \u2014 who had a season-high 33 points against the Heat \u2014 was looking for stairs to help that not-so-big climb.",
      "He was tired. Understandably so.",
      "\u201cReady to go home,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d",

Bell said in his ruling this week, which favored 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports, that \u201cNASCAR fans (and members of the public who may become fans) have an interest in watching all the teams compete with their best drivers and most competitive teams.\u201d",
      "The hearing is the latest in the legal brawl between the two Cup teams and the sanctioning body that began late last season. Judge Bell is set to decide other motions, as well. He also set a Sept. 19, 2025, deadline for discovery to be completed and set a trial date of Dec. 1, 2025.",
      "23XI, the team owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row refused in September to sign take-it-or-leave it revenue sharing offers made by NASCAR just 48 hours before the start of the playoffs.",
      "A charter is essentially a franchise and guarantees prize money, a spot in the field each week and other protections.",
      "The teams filed an antitrust suit alleging NASCAR owners are \u201cmonopolistic bullies\u201d and were denied in federal court in November a request to be recognized as \u201cchartered\u201d teams as the suit continues.",
      "23XI and Front Row can now sign the charter agreements and still pursue their lawsuit. They also each were granted permission to purchase additional charters from Stewart Haas Racing, which closed its four-team shop at the end of the 2024 season, and NASCAR must approve the transfers to those teams.",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers topped a record nine teams owing Major League Baseball\u2019s luxury tax this year with an unprecedented $103 million penalty",
      "NEW YORK -- The Los Angeles Dodgers topped a record nine teams owing Major League Baseball's luxury tax this year with an unprecedented $103 million penalty, and the $97.1 million bill for the New York Mets raises their tax total under high-spending owner Steve Cohen to nearly $229 million.",
      "The World Series champion Dodgers will pay a tax for the fourth year in a row. The Dodgers' tax payroll of $353 million included $1,032,454 in non-cash compensation for Shohei Ohtani, whose contract calls for use of a suite for games at Dodger Stadium and an interpreter.",
      "The Yankees owe $62.5 million, according to figures finalized Friday by Major League Baseball and the players' association and obtained by The Associated Press. They were followed by Philadelphia ($14.4 million), Atlanta ($14 million), Texas ($10.8 million), Houston ($6.5 million), San Francisco ($2.4 million) and the Chicago Cubs ($570,000).",
      "The total tax of $311.3 million topped the previous high of $209.8 million last year, when eight teams paid. Tax money is due to MLB by Jan. 21.",
      "More than $1 billion in taxes have been collected since the penalty started in 2003, with 15 teams paying $1.23 billion. The Yankees lead at $452 million, followed by the Dodgers at $350 million and the Mets.",
      "Toronto, with a series of summer trades, cut its tax payroll to $233.9 million, under the $237 million threshold. The Blue Jays started the season projected at $244.3 million.",
      "Chicago went just over the threshold at $239.85 million.",
      "The Mets dropped their luxury tax payroll from last year's record $374.7 million to $347.7 million and cut their tax from last year's then-record $100.8 million. The Dodgers, Mets and Yankees ($316.2 million) were the only teams exceeding the fourth threshold, added in the 2022 labor contract and nicknamed the Cohen Tax in an initiative aimed at slowing his spending.",
      "Among teams paying the tax, the Giants, Rangers and Cubs missed the playoffs.",
      "Total spending on luxury tax payrolls rose 2.3% to $5.924 billion from $5.793 billion last year.",
      "Tax payrolls are calculated by average annual values, including earned bonuses, for players on 40-man rosters along with just over $17 million per team for benefits and $1.67 million for each club\u2019s share of the $50 million pool for pre-arbitration players that started in 2022. Deferred salaries and deferred bonus payments are discounted to present-day values.",
      "Because they owe tax for three straight years, the Mets, Dodgers, Yankees and Phillies pay at a 50% rate on the first $20 million above the $237 million threshold, a 62% rate on the next $20 million, a 95% rate on the amount from $277 million to $297 million and a 110% amount above that.",
      "The Braves and Rangers owe tax for the second year in a row and pay 30% on the first $20 million over and 42% on the next $20 million.",
      "Houston is paying tax for the first time, though the Astros topped the threshold in 2020 when the penalty was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Giants are paying for the first time since 2017 and the Cubs for the first time since 2019.",
      "The labor contract calls for the first $3.5 million of tax money to be used to fund player benefits and 50% of the remainder to fund player Individual Retirement Accounts. The other 50% of what\u2019s left is dedicated to a supplemental commissioner\u2019s discretionary fund that is distributed among teams that are eligible to receive revenue-sharing money and have grown their non-media local revenue. For this year, the union and MLB agreed to allow discretionary fund distributions of up to $15 million each to teams whose local media revenue has declined since 2022 or 2023.",
      "Next year\u2019s initial threshold is $241 million. If the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers, Phillies. Braves or Rangers go over, they would pay at the highest tax rate, rising to 110% for the amount over $301 million.",

      "He was forced to play with mismatched cleats on Oct. 28 against Cincinnati when one of his green Air Jordan 4 PEs came off during a run down the sideline. But Hurts had tied the laces so tightly that he couldn\u2019t easily slip on the cleat and was forced to burn a timeout to find a substitute shoe. He changed to a white Jordan 11.",

Some were the sort that have never been seen before, in a jarring way: Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 golfer, got arrested before the second round of the PGA Championship and taken away in handcuffs to jail \u2014 where he had a sandwich and started warming up for the tee time he ended up making.",

      "The highlight, of course, was Noah Lyles' .005-second victory in the 100-meter dash. He ran the fastest time of his life and didn't take the lead until the absolute last instant, a finish that even had commentators guessing wrong about who actually prevailed.",

      "ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- How fast can she go on her titanium knee? And how competitive will she be?",
      "Those are the big questions surrounding Lindsey Vonn\u2019s comeback to World Cup ski racing this weekend at age 40 after nearly six years of retirement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a question that\u2019s been going through my head a lot over the last week,\u201d said Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach. \u201cShe\u2019s not far away.\u201d",
      "Vonn is slated to race super-Gs on Saturday and Sunday in St. Moritz.",
      "While Vonn has won a record 28 World Cup super-Gs, including three at the Swiss resort, calculating her current potential is not an exact science.",
      "During two lower-level FIS super-G races in Copper Mountain, Colorado, two weeks ago, she finished 24th and 19th. Although not too much should be read into those results, because Vonn\u2019s main goal was just completing the race with a half-decent time to gain the necessary qualifying points to return to the World Cup \u2014 which she accomplished.",
      "A better guide might be last weekend\u2019s World Cup races in Beaver Creek, Colorado, when Vonn was the final forerunner testing the course.",
      "Knight said that Vonn\u2019s forerunning times were 1.2 seconds behind downhill winner Cornelia Huetter and 1.4 behind super-G winner Sofia Goggia \u2014 which would have placed her about 12th in both races.",
      "But Vonn said she wasn\u2019t going 100% during her forerunning duties.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s still got a lot left. She can push a lot harder,\u201d Knight told The Associated Press as he arrived in St. Moritz. \u201cOnce she gets in the start gate with the bib on, she\u2019s going to go obviously as hard as she can.\u201d",
      "Under a new wild card rule for former champions, Vonn will start after the top 30 ranked racers complete their runs \u2014 likely with No. 31 or No. 32.",
      "The Engiadina course in St. Moritz is entirely above the tree line, which makes it susceptible to strong and sudden gusts of wind.",
      "\u201cMaybe starting No. 31 won\u2019t be so bad with those long flats at the top, to get some of that fresh snow off the track. Speed it up a little bit,\u201d Knight said.",
      "Sun is forecast for Saturday, with overcast conditions and possibly some snow on Sunday.",
      "By the time Vonn comes down, Goggia, Olympic champion Lara Gut-Behrami and the other top racers will have already come down.",
      "Mikaela Shiffrin, who shares the record of five wins in St. Moritz across all disciplines with Vonn, isn\u2019t racing this weekend as she recovers from abdominal surgery to clean out a puncture wound she sustained in a crash last month.",
      "Vonn left the tour with 82 World Cup wins \u2014 the record for a woman at the time and within reach of the then all-time Alpine mark of 86 held by Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark. The women\u2019s record held by Vonn was eclipsed in January 2023 by Shiffrin, who now has an outright record 99 wins.",
      "Vonn\u2019s last big race was the downhill at the world championships in Are, Sweden, in February 2019 when she won bronze on her damaged legs, which had been worn down by a series of crashes and injuries that forced her to retire.",
      "But she underwent replacement surgery on her right knee in April and is feeling better physically now than she has in years.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s in way, way better balance than she was back then,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThis knee is in incredible shape now. She has no swelling, no pain. And for the first three camps \u2014 July, September and November, I never saw out of balance once, which is pretty impressive.\u201d",
      "Knight, who also coached Vonn within the U.S. Ski Team during various phases of her earlier career, first heard rumblings about her return a year ago. Then in May as Vonn was healing from the surgery, they drew out a comeback plan with Knight in his new role as a Red Bull coach. She first hit the snow on the glacier in Soelden, Austria, in July. Then they went to New Zealand, back to Soelden and ultimately finished the prep period in Colorado.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a better skier right now. A better balanced skier than I remember at the end of her last season,\u201d Knight said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it when you start watching.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe boots are new \u2014 it\u2019s a completely different model,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThose things are the fine details that you need to have dialed in to really be at the top of ski racing. Fundamentally I\u2019m in a great place, and now it\u2019s just fine tuning to be able to be truly competitive.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s longtime ski technician Heinz Haemmerle retired, so her equipment supplier Head assigned her Chris Krause, who formerly worked for Didier Cuche and Bode Miller.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very, very particular with the equipment,\u201d Knight said. \u201cAnd Lindsey really likes that.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought we put 'em away in game four and they found a way to win that game and carry a lot of momentum into game five,\" Nebraska coach John Cook said. \"Tremendous performance by Jess. She hit some shots we had no answer for.\u201d",
      "Mruzik, whose 579 points ranked 23rd nationally coming in, registered 27.5 points with 70 attacks. Starck had 56 assists while Gillian Grimes recorded 25 digs for Penn State.",

      "The host Cardinals overcame a 25-21 opening-set loss to top Pitt 25-23, 29-27 and 25-17. All-American outside hitter/right setter Olivia Babcock had 33 kills for the Panthers.",
      "The first set of Nebraska-Penn State featured 10 ties and six lead changes, with the Cornhuskers scoring four unanswered points to erase a 23-21 deficit. Andi Jackson sandwiched three kills around a service ace by Merritt Beason, including the final two points of a tense opener.",
      "The Huskers wiped out 3-0 deficit in the second set with four consecutive points and later added a 5-0 spurt for a 16-8 cushion on the way to a comfortable victory before Penn State found its resolve.",

      "Kirk Cousins didn\u2019t forget how to play quarterback",
      "Kirk Cousins didn\u2019t forget how to play quarterback. He just didn\u2019t do it well enough often enough to keep his job in Atlanta.",
      "Don\u2019t write off the veteran just yet.",
      "There\u2019s no sugarcoating the way Cousins played over the past five games. He struggled mightily, throwing just one touchdown pass and nine interceptions in that span.",
      "But this was the same guy who had 117.2 passer rating and led the Falcons to a comeback win on the final drive in Week 2 in Philadelphia in just his second start coming back from surgery for a torn Achilles tendon.",
      "Cousins threw for 509 yards and four touchdowns against the Buccaneers on Oct. 3. He had four TD passes and a 145.9 passer rating in another win over Tampa Bay on Oct. 27. He followed that up with three TD passes and a 144.8 rating in a victory against Dallas a week later on Nov. 3.",
      "Then came a terrible stretch. That prompted Falcons coach Raheem Morris to make the bold decision to bench Cousins for rookie Michael Penix Jr. in the middle of a playoff chase.",
      "The Falcons lost four straight games, including three in a row against teams with tough defenses \u2014 Broncos, Chargers, Vikings \u2014 before beating the Raiders. Cousins only threw 17 passes, completing 11 for 112 yards, one TD and one interception in a 15-9 win in Las Vegas.",
      "That wasn\u2019t good enough to keep him in the lineup.",
      "Penix, the eighth overall pick in the NFL draft, gets a soft landing for his first career start. The Falcons (7-7) host the woeful New York Giants (2-12) on Sunday. Atlanta could win that game giving the ball to Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier 50 times.",
      "Cousins will watch from the sideline as an expensive backup. The Falcons gave the four-time Pro Bowl QB a $180 million, four-year contract on the first day of free agency. Cousins got $100 million guaranteed with $27.5 million of that money still owed to him.",
      "His contract, which includes a no-trade clause, complicates a pending divorce from Atlanta. Of course, Cousins is also just one play away from going back under center if Penix gets hurt.",
      "If Penix stays healthy, this still isn\u2019t the end for Cousins.",
      "Just two weeks ago, Morris was heaping praising on him.",
      "\u201cThat guy has carried us,\u201d Morris said after Cousins threw four picks in a loss to the Chargers on Dec. 1. \u201cThat guy has got us to the point where we\u2019re 6-6 and we\u2019re first place in the division. Still got everything in front of us, despite what happened today. It\u2019s up to us to bounce back and find a way to win football games, and there\u2019s no better man than (No.) 18 to go do that for us.\u201d",
      "Cousins turns 37 before the start of the 2025 season. He should still have plenty of football left in his right arm. He could veto any trade and force Atlanta to release him. If the Falcons designate Cousins a post-June 1 release, they would incur a dead-cap hit of $40 million. The Broncos took on a $49.5 million hit this season by releasing Russell Wilson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pro football. There\u2019s a standard that I have for myself, that the team has for me,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cUnfortunately, I wasn\u2019t playing up to that standard consistently enough. It is what it is. You roll with it. Now, you still get ready, one play away kind of a thing, and support Mike and just try to help our team be able to find a way to win these last three to get in the playoffs. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. That\u2019s my focus.\u201d",
      "Several teams will enter the offseason looking for a new starting quarterback, including the Giants, Titans and Raiders. The Jets and Browns, also could be in the mix.",
      "Cousins isn\u2019t at a point where he should accept a backup job. There are too many mediocre quarterbacks across the league.",

      "Muhleman died on Saturday in Charlotte peacefully after battling some heart-related issues, his son Lee Patterson told The Associated Press.",
      "Muhleman worked closely with Panthers founder Jerry Richardson in his quest to bring an NFL franchise to the Carolinas in the early 1990s. Muhleman delivered the closing marketing pitch at the October 1993 owners\u2019 meetings for Richardson, who would ultimately be unanimously awarded the league\u2019s 29th franchise.",
      "The Panthers began playing in 1995.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of people realize what a big role Max played in getting the expansion team,\" said former Panthers director of communications Charlie Dayton. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t out front, he preferred to be in the background. That was him. But he was as valuable as anybody in the process of getting a team. He was there every step of the way.\u201d",
      "Muhleman's marketing plan for the Panthers included landing three NFL preseason games in Raleigh and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and another in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "All three games sold out, helping prove to league owners that the Carolinas were a viable market.",
      "Still, there was the matter of funding the expansion team.",
      "Richardson didn't want to use taxpayer money and the league was worried at the time about him taking on any additional debt.",
      "That is when Muhleman invented the concept of the PSL, where fans could pay a one-time fee for the annual right to buy season tickets. The Panthers sold more than 55,000 PSLs and the millions raised from that venture were used to build the 72,000-seat Bank of America Stadium in downtown Charlotte.",
      "The stadium continues to serve as home of the Panthers and the Charlotte FC Major League Soccer team.",
      "Tamera Green, who worked with Muhleman for more than a decade and now serves as the senior vice president and communications officer with the Panthers, said Muhleman was an incredibly talented and creative man.",
      "\u201cHe had some really cool \u2018firsts\u2019 in sports,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe idea of the PSL almost came out of desperation at the time. It was like a Hail Mary. And it worked.\"",
      "Several other professional sports franchises have since adopted the idea of PSLs as a means of funding private stadiums and arenas.",
      "The Panthers still use PSLs.",
      "Earlier in his career, Muhleman worked alongside then-Hornets owner George Shinn to develop the strategy and pitch that would help Charlotte land an NBA expansion team in 1988.",
      "He also advised Rick Hendrick when he was looking into becoming a NASCAR team owner.",
      "Patterson said his father's greatest quality might have been his ability to develop and maintain personal relationships.",
      "\u201cHe loved sports,\" Patterson said. \u201cWhat he was able to do, because of his background as a top-notch sports journalist, was make people he spoke to feel important and liked. He made them feel that they wanted to do business with him. It was the cultivation of not just clients, but friends. And he went on to sustain relationships with all of his clients.\u201d ___",

      "The lawsuits target the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires California to reduce the environmental impact of transportation fuels by incentivizing producers to cut emissions. The California Air Resources Board voted last month to increase the state\u2019s emission reduction targets, fund charging infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, and phase out incentives for capturing methane emissions from dairy farms to turn into fuel.",

    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "Suspected drone sightings in the eastern U.S. are continuing to captivate many, but the federal government's authority to track and disable any threatening unmanned aircraft is set to expire after Friday",
      "As suspected drone sightings over the eastern U.S. including New Jersey continue to captivate many, the federal government's authority to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed threatening is set to expire after Friday and a temporary spending bill before Congress that would extend that power is now in question.",
      "Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17.",
      "Federal and local authorities have been investigating sightings of suspected drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.",
      "Tucked into the bipartisan plan to prevent a government shutdown is a provision that would extend the authority of the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed a credible threat from Dec. 20 until March 14.",
      "That authority is vital, homeland security officials and experts say, to detect and disable any threatening drones flying near military bases, the president's location, U.S. borders, prisons and mass gatherings such as New Year's Eve celebrations and the Super Bowl \u2014 and they were hopeful a reauthorization of those powers will be approved before Friday's expiration.",
      "But the temporary spending bill including the reauthorization fell into question Wednesday when President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected it and told Republicans to essentially renegotiate only days before the deadline when federal funding runs out. Congress continued working Thursday to pass a bill to avert a shutdown.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what a lapse in that authority would mean, including to drone detection systems the federal government has deployed to states, including New Jersey where numerous sightings have been reported, at the request of local officials. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office referred questions about the detection systems to Homeland Security officials.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday declined to comment on the expiration of the drone authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, along with other Biden administration officials and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, has repeatedly called for the reauthorization and expansion of the authority for \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d operations, or C-UAS.",
      "\u201cEnsuring that existing authorities do not lapse is vital to our mission, including protecting the president and vice president, patrolling certain designated areas along the Southwest Border, securing certain federal facilities and assets, and safeguarding the public,\u201d Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee in November 2023. \u201cAny lapse in DHS\u2019s current C-UAS authority would entail serious risks for our homeland security, as DHS would have to cease or curtail existing C-UAS operations.\"",
      "Bills in the House and Senate that would extend and expand the federal government's drone powers remain pending. The bills also would allow state and local officials for the first time to track and disable threatening drones under a pilot program overseen by federal authorities.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, was blocked from quickly advancing the Senate bill when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, objected to its passage. Paul said it wasn\u2019t clear there is a threat from drones that warrants urgent action."

    "story": [
      "Global battery maker CATL says it will expand its electric vehicle battery swapping in China in 2025",
      "Detroit -- China will soon see a massive expansion of electric vehicle battery swapping, as global battery maker CATL said Wednesday it is investing heavily in stations there next year.",
      "Battery swapping is not new \u2014 but it's had a challenging journey. Adoption of electric vehicles has varied in regions across the globe over the past several years, and that doesn't always bode well for building new infrastructure.",
      "While the technology could do well in China, it's uncertain whether it could work in other countries.",
      "Battery swapping allows EV drivers to pull into a station on a low battery and receive a swapped, fully-charged battery within minutes.",
      "An EV has to be equipped with the right technology to receive a swap \u2014 and not many models around the world currently have it. Automakers have to buy into the idea, and EV adoption among consumers also has to grow, so that investing in new infrastructure seems worthwhile. Consumers also have to be comfortable not owning their battery.",
      "China is much further along in adopting EVs than other countries.",
      "Not only is it the world's largest auto market, but in July, the country hit a milestone with 50% of new sales electric \u2014 and it accounts for most of this year's global EV sales.",
      "China supports EV growth through government subsidies and mandates. So it makes more sense for companies to invest in unique EV infrastructure there because that's more likely to be needed.",
      "The most notable example might be Israeli startup Better Place, which tried its hand at swapping in 2007.",
      "But the company shut down a few years later after investing a lot of money and coming up against roadblocks with logistics. EV adoption was especially low at the time.",
      "Startup Ample, for example, has a modular battery swapping station that it says can complete a swap in 5 minutes. That\u2019s important as charging time remains a point of concern for prospective EV buyers. Even the fastest fast chargers could take at least 15 minutes for a decent charge.",
      "But in the U.S., pure EVs only accounted for 8% of new vehicle sales as of November.",
      "Meanwhile Nio, a rival Chinese EV brand, has about 60 swap stations in northern Europe, and the EV adoption is higher there than the U.S., but the same challenges remain.",
      "Different automakers put different batteries in their various EV models, so a station would need all of those available if the industry didn't agree to a standardized battery, and not all of those models are out yet in volume. This is something that really needs scale.",
      "Swapping could help with EV cost \u2014 currently a barrier to adoption for many \u2014 because a driver wouldn\u2019t necessarily own the most expensive part of an EV: the battery.",
      "Greg Less, director of the University of Michigan Battery Lab, said with proper framing and education, people might like the idea of battery swapping. To him, it's not unlike buying a propane-fueled grill and purchasing a refilled tank every so often. But it would require a rethinking of car ownership.",
      "\"Where I could see it working is if we went entirely away from vehicle ownership and we went to a use-on-demand model,\" Less added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d",
      "Battery swapping might make most sense for ride-sharing or other fleet vehicles.",
      "Drivers of buses, taxis, Uber or Lyft vehicles want to spend as much time on the road as possible, transporting customers and making money. If battery swapping can shorten the time needed to charge EVs, that makes driving one less disruptive to their business.",

      "The agency's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the report, does not have the resources to enforce export controls and has been too reliant on U.S. chip makers voluntarily complying with the rules.",
      "But the push for bolstering Commerce's export control enforcement comes as the incoming Trump administration says it is looking to dramatically reduce the size and scope of federal government.

      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, chair of the subcommittee, pointed to news reports of the Russian military continuing to acquire components from Texas Instruments through front companies in Hong Kong to illustrate how the export controls are failing as an effective tool.",

      "\u201cWhile Congress must provide BIS more resources to undertake its critical mission, it is long past time for BIS to make full use of the enforcement powers Congress has conferred upon it and take aggressive steps to cut the flow of U.S. semiconductors into the Russian war machine,\u201d Blumenthal wrote.",
      "Blumenthal in a separate statement added that he was calling on \"Commerce to take immediate action and crack down on the companies allowing U.S.-made semiconductors to power Russian weapons and Chinese ambition.\u201d",
      "It's not just Texas Instruments that's the issue. The subcommittee in September published a report that found aggregated exports from four major U.S. advanced chip manufacturers nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 to Armenia and Georgia.",
      "Both of those countries are home to front companies known to assist Russia in acquiring advanced chips made in the U.S. despite export controls.",
      "China, meanwhile, has created \u201cvast, barely disguised smuggling networks which enable it to continue to harness U.S. technology,\u201d the subcommittee report asserts.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls in China, as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of chips in the U.S.",
      "But Chinese companies have found ways to evade export controls in part because of a lack of China subject matter experts and Chinese speakers assigned to Commerce's export control enforcement.",
      "The agency's current budget limits the number of international end-use checks, or physical verification overseas of distributors or companies receiving American-made chips that are the supposed end users of products. Currently, Commerce has only 11 export control officers spread around the globe to conduct such checks.",
      "The committee made several recommendations in its report, including Congress allocating more money for hiring additional personnel to enforce export controls, imposing larger fines on companies that violate controls and requiring periodic reviews of advanced chip companies\u2019 export control plans by outside entities.",

      "In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Matilda Djerf said she was \u201cgenuinely sorry\u201d to anyone she has \u201churt or let down\u201d after the tabloid, Aftonbladet, reported employees at her company had experienced or saw public berating, bullying and a \u201cculture of favoritism and control.\u201d",
      "The tabloid's report, which was published last week, cited 11 anonymous former and current workers at the Swedish brand, several of whom said they experienced panic attacks, anxiety and sleep problems while working for Djerf.",
      "One person told Aftonbladet that Djerf \u2014 whose company focuses on inclusivity \u2014 said she wanted a photo shoot of a plus-sized model redone, using an expletive and saying the model looked too \u201cfat\u201d in the clothes.",
      "The report also cited someone that said Djerf had installed her own toilet at the company that could only be used by her and \u201cher favorites.\u201d One employee had to scrub the toilet because it was used by the wrong person, it said.",
      "\u201cWhen I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\u201d Djerf wrote in her post on Instagram, where she has 3 million followers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready. I had never led a team prior to this, I had never built a company, and under lot of stress, high tempo, and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way. And for that I am so, so sorry.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old also said her business \u2014 which sells apparel, beauty and homeware products \u2014 was making \u201cimportant changes\u201d to improve the work culture. She said the company has hired a \u201cmore experienced\u201d management team and were teaming up with an external organizational psychologist who could talk to employees.",
      "Djerf Avenue is also now doing monthly anonymous surveys to collect feedback from workers, the post said.",
      "Last year, Djerf was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list along with her boyfriend Rasmus Johansson, who co-founded the clothing label with her in 2019.",
      "Known for her \u201cclean girl\u201d aesthetic looks and bouncy hair, Djerf recently had a prominent campaign with model Hailey Bieber\u2019s skincare and beauty line, Rhode."

      "SCOTCHTOWN, N.Y. -- Scholars are hailing the discovery of a fossilized mastodon jaw discovered by a man who spotted two giant teeth while gardening at his upstate New York home this year.",
      "The mastodon jaw and some other bone fragments were found in late September in a backyard near Scotchtown, a hamlet about 70 miles (112 kilometers) northwest of New York City, officials from the New York State Museum said.",
      "The owner of the backyard does not want to be identified, said Robert Feranec, the state museum's director of research and collections and curator of Ice Age animals.",
      "The individual spotted what he first thought were baseballs, Feranec said Wednesday. \u201cHe picked them up and realized they were teeth,\u201d he said.",
      "Excavation by staff from the museum and the State University of New York's Orange County campus yielded a full, well-preserved jaw of an adult mastodon as well as a piece of a toe bone and a rib fragment, museum officials said.",
      "\u201cWhile the jaw is the star of the show, the additional toe and rib fragments offer valuable context and the potential for additional research,\u201d said Cory Harris, chair of SUNY Orange's behavioral sciences department. \u201cWe are also hoping to further explore the immediate area to see if there are any additional bones that were preserved.\u201d",
      "Officials with the Albany-based state museum said the jaw was the first complete mastodon jaw found in New York in 11 years. They said there have been more than 150 fossils from the extinct elephant relative found statewide to date, about a third of them in Orange County in the same area as the recent find.",
      "Feranec said the newly unearthed jaw provides \u201ca unique opportunity to study the ecology of this magnificent species, which will enhance our understanding of the Ice Age ecosystems from this region.\u201d",
      "The fossils will be carbon-dated and analyzed to determine the mastodon\u2019s age, diet and habitat during its lifetime and will be put on public display sometime in 2025, museum officials said."

    "story": [
      "The federal government says that two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts and that one is likely to die from its injuries",
      "Two endangered whales have been spotted entangled in fishing gear off Massachusetts, and one is likely to die from its injuries, the federal government said.",
      "They are North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 400 and face existential threats from entanglement in gear and collisions with ships. An aerial survey found the whales swimming about 50 miles southeast of Nantucket on Dec. 9, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "One of the whales is a juvenile that has a thick line that passes across its head and back and is likely to succumb to the injury, the agency said in a statement. The other whale is an adult female who biologists think has suffered a sublethal injury from the entanglement, NOAA said.",
      "NOAA said in a statement Tuesday that it would \u201cwork with authorized responders and trained experts to monitor the whales\u201d and that it will \u201cfurther document the entanglements and determine if entanglement responses will be possible.\u201d",
      "The news of the entangled whales follows the release of new data from researchers this fall showing a slight uptick in the whale's population. A group of researchers said two months ago that the population increased about 4% from 2020.",
      "However, those researchers and environmental advocates cautioned at the time that the whales still faced the threat of extinction. The animal's population fell about 25% from 2010 to 2020.",
      "The entanglement of the two whales illustrates the need for new safeguards to protect the animals, said Gib Brogan, campaign director at Oceana. Environmentalists have pushed for new restrictions on commercial fishing and shipping to try to protect the whales.",
      "\u201cThese whales are not statistics; they are living beings enduring unimaginable suffering caused by human activities,\u201d Brogan said.",
      "The whales migrate every year and usually arrive in Cape Cod Bay in early winter and stay until around the middle of May. They give birth off the coasts of Georgia and Florida and are slow to reproduce, which is one of the reasons conservationists say they can't withstand additional mortality.",
      "The whales were once abundant off the East Coast, but they were decimated during the era of commercial whaling. They have been federally protected for decades.",
      "Some scientists have said climate change is a major threat to the whales because it has changed the availability of their food. That has caused them to stray from protected areas of ocean.",
      "\u201cNorth Atlantic right whales continue to be entangled at levels that could push this critically endangered species to extinction. It is distressing that multiple generations of right whales have been affected by the devastating harm of entanglements, which is resulting in deaths, health declines, and slower reproductive rates,\" said Amy Knowlton, senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona's subway system is using regenerative braking to help power both its convoys but also recharge electric cars at street level",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The Barcelona subway grinds to a halt, the doors slide open and commuters pour out to go about their daily business.",
      "Little do they know that as they do so, a burst of energy is sent up to street level to help charge an electric car.",
      "Barcelona has put together a package of clean energy technologies to help public transportation go greener, while also doing its part to combat climate change and aid Europe's difficult shift to the privately owned electric vehicle market.",
      "Sixteen stations of Barcelona\u2019s subway system are part of its new MetroCharge project, whereby the energy from the underground trains' brakes is used to power the trains and the stations themselves, while the remainder is sent snaking through cables to the surface to power plug-in stations for privately owned vehicles.",
      "Bernardo Espinoza, a 49-year-old engineer, commutes daily by subway. He also owns a hybrid car and had just found out that he had a new place to plug in.",
      "\u201cI am pleasantly surprised, because I have an electric car and am always looking for where to plug it in,\u201d Espinoza said before catching the subway in a working-class area of southern Barcelona. \u201cAnd if it is from energy from the metro\u2019s brakes, then even better.\u201d",
      "Regenerative brakes have been in trains for decades and are also used in some cars. They consist of an electric motor which captures energy used in the braking action that would be lost as heat by conventional brakes. That energy can be immediately used to accelerate the vehicle or, in the case of the Barcelona subway system, sent along cables to supply electricity for the station or for electric car chargers.",
      "Alvaro Luna, professor of electrical engineering at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, said that the system is innovative in so far as it allows for recycled energy to be redirected to specific local uses \u2014 in this case powering electric cars parked nearby. That, he says, boosts efficiency.",
      "\u201cSince the recharging stations are installed nearby, the energy, instead of being put back into the general electric network, goes directly to the charging stations, and that allows the provider to potentially offer lower prices,\u201d Luna said. \u201cWe can say that the innovation is one of urban planning, of being able to bring together energy uses within a city.\u201d",
      "Making better use of energy has become a key pillar of reducing rising global temperatures. Last year, countries at U.N. climate talks and the members of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging-market nations agreed to double energy efficiency by 2030.",
      "Jordi Picas, head of systems for TMB, Barcelona\u2019s subway, said that the public company estimates that it can recover the 7.3 million euros ($7.6 million) spent on MetroCharge, which includes European Union funding, in four years thanks to reduced energy costs.",
      "The system, which also includes solar panels, provides all the energy needs of 28 of the 163 subway stations, from the lights to the elevators and ventilation systems, and saves 6% of the total energy spent by the metro, according to Picas. An average of 2.3 million people take the Barcelona metro on any given workday.",
      "This clever program comes while doubts are emerging about the speed and cost of the EU's green transition as the 27-member bloc seeks to eliminate combustion engines and remain a world leader in standards for environmental protection.",
      "Spain, like other Mediterranean countries, is feeling the burn of climate change, experts say, with the frequency of prolonged droughts and extreme weather events like the recent devastating floods in Valencia set to increase over the coming years.",
      "In 2021, Spain\u2019s government rolled out an ambitious electric car plan backed by the EU\u2019s post-pandemic transition funds. The public incentives have succeeded in encouraging private investment like last week\u2019s announcement by Chinese battery maker CATL and carmaker Stellantis to build a lithium battery factory in Zaragoza. The plan also included help for consumers.",
      "But Spain hasn't been immune to the stumbles in the industry across Europe as the EU moves toward tariffs on Chinese EVs to try to help continental carmakers catch up.",
      "Spain, with its wide expanses for a Western European country, faces the extra challenge of deploying recharging stations. Spain has 37,000 charging points, below the goal of 100,000 the government had set for now in 2021, according to ANFAC, the Spanish Association of Automobile and Truck Manufacturers.",
      "So while the Barcelona subway concept can help chart a course for urban planners, there is still a lot of work to do.",
      "\u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda said that he agreed with the spirt of the initiative while plugging his hybrid taxi into a charging point fed by the Barcelona subway.",
      "But he also said that the government should do more to help shoppers buy electric cars because \u201cpeople don\u2019t really go for electric cars here.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.",
      "\u201cThe public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,\" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. \u201cWe are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.\u201d",
      "Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman \u2014 and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk\u2019s businesses or for Trump\u2019s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.",
      "Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.",
      "\u201cEven though there\u2019s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.",
      "Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla\u2019s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.",
      "\u201cHaving your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I\u2019m paying someone to not work for my company,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude, this isn\u2019t fair.\u2019\u201d",
      "But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won\u2019t stop investing in Musk\u2019s businesses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money with Elon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.\u201d",

      "He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world\u2019s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk \u2014 again, similar to Trump.",
      "Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.",
      "\"Trump has always pushed this narrative that he\u2019s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,\u201d said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIn this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.\u201d",
      "Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.",
      "Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "Some analysts believe the billionaire\u2019s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk\u2019s relationship with Trump could \u201crevolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.\u201d",
      "Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a \u201cchampagne moment.\u201d Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.",

      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump\u2019s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks.

      "\u201cFor Tesla, I don\u2019t see a ton of benefit from this,\u201d he said. \u201cElon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s other companies \u2014 including his artificial intelligence company, xAI \u2014 could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.",
      "\u201cAI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,\u201d Gerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.\u201d",
      "The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have confirmed that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. confirmed Wednesday that they are discussing closer collaboration but denied reports they have decided on a merger.",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price soared nearly 24% in Tokyo after reports citing unnamed sources said it might merge with Honda to form the world\u2019s third-largest automaking group. Honda\u2019s share price fell as much as 3%. Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is also part of the talks.",
      "Trading in Nissan\u2019s shares was suspended but then resumed after the companies jointly issued a statement saying they were \u201cconsidering various possibilities for future collaboration, but no decisions have been made.\u201d",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle.

      "TOKYO -- A Japanese space startup said its second attempt to launch a rocket carrying satellites into orbit had been aborted minutes after liftoff Wednesday and destroyed itself again, nine months after the company's first launch attempt ended in an explosion.",
      "Space One's Kairos No. 2 rocket lifted off from a coastal site in the mountainous prefecture of Wakayama in central Japan.",
      "The company said it had aborted the flight after concluding that it was unlikely to complete its mission.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry that we could not achieve as far as a final stage of the mission,\u201d Space One President Masakazu Toyoda told a news conference Wednesday. \u201cWe don't consider this a failure because we are getting valuable data that will help our pursuit toward a next challenge.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped to find the cause to address the problems as soon as possible to achieve a success next time.",
      "Company executive and space engineer Mamoru Endo said the abnormality in the first stage engine nozzle or its control system is likely to have caused an unstable flight of the rocket, which started spiraling in midflight and eventually destroyed itself about three minutes after liftoff, using its autonomous safety mechanism.",
      "The rocket, which rose higher than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above ground, entered space entered space before it was destroyed, officials said.",
      "Space One aims to be Japan\u2019s first company to put a satellite into orbit, hoping to boost Japan\u2019s lagging space industry with a small rocket for an affordable space transport business.",
      "Wednesday's flight, postponed twice from Saturday because of strong winds, came nine months after a failed debut flight in March, when the rocket was intentionally exploded five seconds after takeoff. The flight was carrying a government satellite that was intended to monitor North Korea\u2019s missile launches and other military activities.",
      "Kairos No. 2 rocket was carrying five small satellites, including one from the Taiwanese space agency and several from Japanese startups.",
      "Space One said it had fixed the cause of the debut flight failure, which stemmed from a miscalculation of the rocket\u2019s first-stage propulsion.",

      "Scientists in China have almost finished building a massive underground detector to sniff out mysterious particles called neutrinos",
      "KAIPING, China -- Underneath a granite hill in southern China, a massive detector is nearly complete that will sniff out the mysterious ghost particles lurking around us.",
      "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory will soon begin the difficult task of spotting neutrinos: tiny cosmic particles with a mind-bogglingly small mass.",
      "The detector is one of three being built across the globe to study these elusive ghost particles in the finest detail yet. The other two, based in the United States and Japan, are still under construction.",
      "Spying neutrinos is no small feat in the quest to understand how the universe came to be. The Chinese effort, set to go online next year, will push the technology to new limits, said Andre de Gouvea, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIf they can pull that off,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be amazing.\u201d",
      "Neutrinos date back to the Big Bang, and trillions zoom through our bodies every second. They spew from stars like the sun and stream out when atomic bits collide in a particle accelerator.",
      "Scientists have known about the existence of neutrinos for almost a century, but they\u2019re still in the early stages of figuring out what the particles really are.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least understood particle in our world,\u201d said Cao Jun, who helps manage the detector known as JUNO. \"That\u2019s why we need to study it.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s no way to spot the tiny neutrinos whizzing around on their own. Instead, scientists measure what happens when they collide with other bits of matter, producing flashes of light or charged particles.",
      "Neutrinos bump into other particles only very rarely, so to up their chances of catching a collision, physicists have to think big.",
      "\u201cThe solution for how we measure these neutrinos is to build very, very big detectors,\u201d de Gouvea said.",
      "The $300 million detector in Kaiping, China, took over nine years to build. Its location 2,297 feet (700 meters) underground protects from pesky cosmic rays and radiation that could throw off its neutrino-sniffing abilities.",
      "On Wednesday, workers began the final step in construction. Eventually, they'll fill the orb-shaped detector with a liquid designed to emit light when neutrinos pass through and submerge the whole thing in purified water.",
      "It'll study antineutrinos \u2014 an opposite to neutrinos which allow scientists to understand their behavior \u2014 produced from collisions inside two nuclear power plants located over 31 miles (50 kilometers) away. When the antineutrinos come into contact with particles inside the detector, they'll produce a flash of light.",
      "The detector is specially designed to answer a key question about a longstanding mystery. Neutrinos switch between three flavors as they zip through space, and scientists want to rank them from lightest to heaviest.",
      "Sensing these subtle shifts in the already evasive particles will be a challenge, said Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University who is not involved with the project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very daring thing to even go after it,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s detector is set to operate during the second half of next year. After that, it\u2019ll take some time to collect and analyze the data \u2014 so scientists will have to keep waiting to fully unearth the secret lives of neutrinos.",
      "Two similar neutrino detectors \u2013 Japan\u2019s Hyper-Kamiokande and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment based in the United States \u2013 are under construction. They\u2019re set to go online around 2027 and 2031 and will cross-check the China detector\u2019s results using different approaches.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have a better understanding of the nature of physics,\u201d said Wang Yifang, chief scientist and project manager of the Chinese effort.",
      "Though neutrinos barely interact with other particles, they\u2019ve been around since the dawn of time. Studying these Big Bang relics can clue scientists into how the universe evolved and expanded billions of years ago.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re part of the big picture,\u201d Scholberg said.",
      "One question researchers hope neutrinos can help answer is why the universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter with its opposing counterpart \u2014 called antimatter \u2014 largely snuffed out.",
      "Scientists don't know how things got to be so out of balance, but they think neutrinos could have helped write the earliest rules of matter.",
      "The proof, scientists say, may lie in the particles. They'll have to catch them to find out.",

      "A young child and an adult were among those killed in the attack, according to Haseloff. At least 40 of those injured were so seriously hurt that their lives are still thought to be in danger, according to a Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",
      "A suspect -- a doctor from Saudi Arabia aged around 50 -- was arrested, Haselhoff said. The man has lived in Germany since 2006. A rental car was used in the attack, the minister said.",

      "President Joe Biden is expected to soon secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is expected to secure the 235th judicial confirmation of his presidency as soon as Friday, an accomplishment that exceeds his predecessor's total by one after Democrats put extra emphasis on the federal courts following Donald Trump's far-reaching first term when he filled three seats to the Supreme Court.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has teed up votes on two potential California district judges, likely to be the last judicial confirmations this year before the Congress adjourns and makes way for a new, Republican-led Senate. He said he hoped to complete the votes by the end of Friday.",
      "The first confirmation will tie Trump's number, the second will break it. Come next year, Republicans will look to boost Trump's already considerable influence on the makeup of the federal judiciary in his second term.",
      "Biden and Senate Democrats placed particular focus on adding women, minorities and public defenders to the judicial rank. About two-thirds of Biden's appointees are women and a majority of appointees are people of color. The most notable appointee was Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\u201cPrior to our effort, the number of women on the federal bench was really diminished. It was overwhelmingly white males,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cWe consciously moved forward to bring more women to the bench, and believe me, we had a great talent pool to work with. So I think it'll enhance the image of the court and its work product to bring these new judges on.\u201d",
      "Biden also placed an emphasis on bringing more civil rights lawyers, public defenders and labor rights lawyers to expand the professional backgrounds of the federal judiciary. More than 45 appointees are public defenders and more than two dozen served as civil rights lawyers.",
      "While Biden did get more district judges confirmed than Trump, he had fewer of higher-tier circuit court appointments than Trump \u2014 45 compared to 54 for Trump. And he got one Supreme Court appointment compared to three for Trump. Republicans, much to Democrats frustration, filled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat on the court the week before the 2020 presidential election. Ginsburg had passed away in September.",
      "Democrats also faced the challenge of confirming nominees during two years of a 50-50 Senate. Rarely a week went by in the current Congress when Schumer did not tee up votes on a judicial confirmation as liberal groups urged Democrats to show the same kind of urgency on judges that Republicans exhibited under Trump.",
      "Some Senate Republicans were harshly critical of Biden's choices. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said talk of diversity did not extend to the views of the nominees.",
      "\"One of the consequences of the age of Trump is that it drove Democrats insane and it drove them to the extreme left, so they put people on the bench who were selected because they were extreme partisans,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Liberal-leaning advocacy groups said they are delighted with the number of judges Democrats secured, but even more so with the quality of the nominees. They said diversity in personal and professional backgrounds improves judicial decision-making, helps build public trust and inspires people from all walks of life to pursue legal careers.",
      "\u201cFor our federal judiciary to actually deliver equal justice for all, it really has to be for all, and that is one reason why we certainly applaud this administration for prioritizing both professional but also demographic diversity,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, senior director of the fair courts program at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.",

      "Part of the urgency from Democrats came as they watched the nation's highest court overturn abortion protections, eliminate affirmative action in higher education and weaken the federal government's ability to protect the environment, public health and workplace safety through regulations. The cases showed that the balance of power in Washington extends to the judicial branch.",
      "Trump will inherit nearly three dozen judicial vacancies, but that number is expected to rise because of Republican-appointed judges who held off on retirement in hopes that a Republican would return to office and pick their replacement.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., acknowledged that the sense of accomplishment for Democrats is muted somewhat knowing that Trump will have another term to continue shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not ready to uncork the champagne just because we\u2019ve done some really good work over the last four years,\" Blumenthal said. \"We need to be prepared to work, hope for the best and try to defeat nominees who are simply unqualified. We have our work cut out for us. The prospects ahead are sobering.\u201d",

      "Johnson blamed Democrats for the bill's failure.",
      "\u201cThe only difference on this legislation was that we would push the debt ceiling to January of 2027,\u201d Johnson claimed. \u201cI want you all to remember that it was just last spring that the same Democrats berated Republicans and said that it was irresponsible to hold the debt limit, the debt ceiling, hostage. What changed?\u201d",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries celebrated the bill's defeat, saying in a statement that Republicans were \u201cnot serious\u201d about helping working class Americans.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump earlier Thursday endorsed the deal that House Republican reached to continue to fund the government through March and avoid a government shutdown at the end of the week.",

      "He also said that the bill would push raising the debt ceiling to January 2027 from June of next year. Congress last raised the country's borrowing limit in June 2023 and had suspended it until June 2025.",
      "\"A VERY important piece, VITAL to the America First Agenda, was added as well - The date of the very unnecessary Debt Ceiling will be pushed out two years, to January 30, 2027. Now we can Make America Great Again, very quickly, which is what the People gave us a mandate to accomplish,\" Trump wrote.",
      "GOP House leaders and Vice-President-elect JD Vance were hoping to appease both Trump's demands that any legislation to fund the government also deals with raising or eliminating the country's debt ceiling, as well as House Republicans on the right who are traditionally against any spending deal or debt limit increase.",

      "Under current law, the federal government would hit its borrowing limit sometime in the spring of 2025, during the first months of the second Trump presidency. Trump, however, said he wants it taken care of now, while Joe Biden is president.",

    "story": [
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified the Fulton County DA from the case.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday disqualified Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from her prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump and his co-defendants in their election interference case.",
      "\"After carefully considering the trial court's findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office\" over what the appeals court called \"a significant appearance of impropriety,\" the ruling said.",
      "The criminal indictment against Trump and his co-defendants still stands, the court said.",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.",
      "Defendants Kenneth Chesebro, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis and Scott Hall subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "Following the Thursday's ruling, the Fulton County DA's office filed notice that they intend to appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme Court. A spokesperson for the DA's office declined to comment further to ABC News.",
      "The appeals court ruling leaves the question of who takes over the case -- and whether it continues -- to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council of Georgia. That decision may be delayed due to the appeals process.",
      "The case has been on pause after Trump and his co-defendants launched an effort to have Willis disqualified from the case over her relationship with fellow prosecutor Nathan Wade. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, leading Trump to appeal that decision.",
      "The appeals court ruled to disqualify Willis and her entire office from the case because \"no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring,\" the order said, reversing Judge McAfee's original decision.",
      "Wade, who had been the lead prosecutor in the case, resigned as special prosecutor in March after McAfee issued his ruling that either Willis or Wade must step aside from the case due to a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" stemming from a romantic relationship between the DA and the prosecutor.",
      "While the appeals court disqualified Willis and her office, it did not find enough evidence to justify \"the extreme sanction\" of tossing the entire indictment against Trump and his co-defendants, as Trump had sought in his appeal.",
      "\"While this is the rare case in which DA Willis and her office must be disqualified due to a significant appearance of impropriety, we cannot conclude that the record also supports the imposition of the extreme sanction of dismissal of the indictment under the appropriate standard,\" the ruling said.",
      "\"The Georgia Court Of Appeals in a well-reasoned and just decision has held that DA Fani Willis\u2019 misconduct in the case against President Trump requires the disqualification of Willis and her office,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said in response to the ruling. \"The Court highlighted that Willis\u2019 misconduct created an 'odor of mendacity' and an appearance of impropriety that could only be cured by the disqualification of her and her entire office. As the Court rightfully noted, only the remedy of disqualification will suffice to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Judge Clay Land -- one of the three judges on the appeals panel -- dissented from the decision, arguing that reversing the trial court \"violates well-established precedent, threatens the discretion given to trial courts, and blurs the distinction between our respective courts.\"",
      "Land argued that the appearance of impropriety -- rather than a true conflict of interest -- is not enough to reverse Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify Willis.",
      "\"For at least the last 43 years, our appellate courts have held that an appearance of impropriety, without an actual conflict of interest or actual impropriety, provides no basis for the reversal of a trial court's denial of a motion to disqualify,\" he wrote.",
      "In his dissent, Land emphasized that the trial court found that Willis did not have a conflict of interest and rejected the allegations of impropriety stemming from her relationship with Wade, including the allegation that she received a financial benefit from his hiring.",
      "\"It was certainly critical of her choices and chastised her for making them. I take no issue with that criticism, and if the trial court had chosen, in its discretion, to disqualify her and her office, this would be a different case,\" he wrote. \"But that is not the remedy the trial court chose, and I believe our case law prohibits us from rejecting that remedy just because we don't like it or just because we might have gone further had we been the trial judge.\"",
      "The Georgia election interference case is one of four criminal cases that were brought against Trump after he left the White House in 2021. His two federal cases, on charges of interfering with the 2020 election and refusing to return classified documents, were dropped following Trump's reelection last month, due to a longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing in New York, following his conviction on charges of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 election, was postponed indefinitely following Trump\u2019s reelection last month."

      "Taylor received credit from Judge Royce Lamberth, who oversaw his initial case and will determine his ability to travel Washington, for his agreement to enter into a plea deal, but he has not ruled yet whether he may attend the inauguration.",

    "title": "Trump backs House GOP accusation Liz Cheney tampered with Jan. 6 committee witness",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 06:02:21 -0500",
    "summary": "She called the allegation \"a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",
    "story": [
      "She called the allegation \"a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk, chairman of the House Administration's subcommittee on Oversight, in a new report suggests former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney should be investigated for alleged criminal witness tampering, claiming she played an \"integral role\" shaping key witness testimony before the Jan. 6 committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump posted early Wednesday morning on his social media platform that \"Liz Cheney could be in a lot of trouble based on the evidence obtained by the subcommittee, which states that 'numerous federal laws were likely broken by Liz Cheney, and these violations should be investigated by the FBI.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Trump, speaking about Jan. 6 committee members,  said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that, \"for what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.\"",
      "The House GOP report released Tuesday marks not only the latest effort by House Republicans to discredit the Jan. 6 committee, but also a possible preview of its oversight efforts in the next session of Congress beginning in January.",
      "Cheney's name appears in the report more than 120 times, excluding the table of contents, going line-by-line to blast her participation as vice chair of the Jan. 6 committee.",
      "\"Without authority and against House Rules -- the role of ranking member, Congress itself must right its former wrongs and declare this appointment of Representative Cheney invalid now,\" the report states.",
      "The report alleges that as Cheney participated in the investigation, she colluded with Cassidy Hutchinson, the former Trump White House aide, about her testimony describing then-President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The report contends that Cheney not only \"backchannelled\" with Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump White House aide and a host of ABC's \"The View,\" to get Hutchinson to change her narrative but also communicated with her \"directly for days.\" After that, the report alleges that Cheney also convinced Hutchinson to fire her attorney, Stefan Passantino.",
      "\"According to text messages, that appear to be from the encrypted messaging app \"Signal,\" between Hutchinson and Farah Griffin obtained by the Subcommittee, Cheney agreed to communicate with Hutchinson through Farah Griffin,\" the subcommittee said.",
      "\"It is unusual -- and potentially unethical -- for a Member of Congress conducting an investigation to contact a witness if the Member knows that the individual is represented by legal counsel,\" the report states. \"This appears to be precisely what Representative Cheney did at this time, and within a matter of days of these secret conversations, Hutchinson would go on to recant her previous testimony and introduce her most outlandish claims.\"",
      "\"What other information was communicated during these phone calls may never be known, but what is known is that Representative Cheney consciously attempted to minimize her contact with Hutchinson in her book, and the most likely reason to try to bury that information would be if Representative Cheney knew that it was improper and unethical to communicate with Hutchinson without her counsel present,\" the report states.",
      "\"It must be emphasized that Representative Cheney would likely have known her communications without the knowledge of Hutchinson's attorney were illicit and unethical at that time,\" the report said. Farah Griffin indicated as much ... in her ... message to Hutchinson ... when she wrote that Representative Cheney's \"one concern\" was that as long as Hutchinson was represented by counsel, \"she [Cheney] can't really ethically talk to you [Hutchinson] without him [Passantino].\" Despite Representative Cheney's initial hesitation, the Subcommittee uncovered evidence of frequent, direct conversations between Hutchinson and Representative Cheney without Passantino's knowledge, and also through their intermediary Farah Griffin.\"",
      "Cheney responded in a statement stressing the testimony \"was painstakingly\" presented in thousands of pages of transcripts, made public along with a \"highly detailed and meticulously sourced 800-page report.\"",
      "\"Chairman Loudermilk's 'Interim Report' intentionally disregards the truth and the Select Committee's tremendous weigh of evidence, and instead fabricates lies and defamatory allegations in an attempt to cover up what Donald Trump did,\" Cheney wrote. \"Their allegations do not reflect a review of the actual evidence, and are a malicious and cowardly assault on the truth.\"",
      "Cheney also did not back off her role and the committee's findings.",
      "\"January 6th showed Donald Trump for who [he] really is \u2013 a cruel and vindictive man who allowed violent attacks to continue against our Capitol and law enforcement officers while he watched television and refused for hours to instruct his supporters to stand down and leave,\" she noted. \"The January 6th Committee's hearings and report featured scores of Republican witnesses, including many of the most senior officials from Trump's own White House, campaign and Administration.\"",
      "Farah Griffin also disputed the GOP report's conclusions.",
      "\"This report is full of inaccuracies and innuendo,\" she said in a statement. \"The report wrongly states - and without any evidence - that I acted as an intermediary between Cassidy Hutchinson and Liz Cheney for \"a month.\" That is not true, and these messages demonstrate the full extent of my involvement. Further, these messages weren't 'obtained' by the Committee - they were requested by the Committee and voluntarily handed over to the Committee. I believe in Congressional oversight, whether it be the January 6th investigation or this inquiry.\"",
      "Trump has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Jan. 6.",

      "Officials in Fiji say a toxicology report shows seven foreign tourists who were hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar were not poisoned by alcohol or illicit drugs",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Seven foreign tourists who were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar were not poisoned by alcohol or illicit drugs, officials said Wednesday following a toxicology report.",
      "The cause of the tourists' illness over the weekend remains under investigation, Fiji\u2019s Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka said.",
      "\u201cI can confirm that no illicit substances or methanol were found in the ingredients or liquor samples,\u201d Gavoka told reporters in the capital, Suva.",
      "\u201cThe findings that there is no evidence of alcohol poisoning is great news for Fiji, especially for our vital tourism industry,\u201d he added.",
      "All seven tourists have since fully recovered, he said.",
      "They became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday.",
      "The tourists, including Australians and an American, were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, Fiji\u2019s Health Ministry said.",
      "News outlets had reported the cause of the foreigners\u2019 illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos last month in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming drinks tainted with methanol.",
      "The suspicion of methanol poisoning was a blow to Fiji\u2019s tourism industry, which has a reputation for providing safe food and drinks.",
      "Alcohol poisoning is a common danger in many poorly regulated tourist destinations, where reputable brands of spirits are substituted with locally distilled ethanol. Methanol can be an unintended byproduct of unprofessional distillation.",
      "Fiji Permanent Secretary for Health Jemesa Tudravu said the illnesses could have been caused by a chemical reaction or infection. His department was continuing to investigate.",
      "Gavoka urged foreign governments to remove from their travel advisories warnings a risk of drink spiking in Fiji that emerged this week.",
      "He said the tourist industry had been rocked by media reports of suspected contaminated drinks, but tourists had not canceled their vacations.",
      "\u201cThere is no indication of people canceling. What we hear is people who are in a sense of disbelief that Fiji could be spiking drinks or Fiji could be adding some harmful stuff into the cocktails,\u201d Gavoka said.",
      "Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said the incident had been confined to a single resort.",
      "\u201cWe'd like to tell everybody that it's safe to come to Fiji and we have to also find out who has been giving out the negative press about Fiji as a destination. Are they competitors for our tourist visitors?\u201d Rabuka said to reporters."

      "Thirty years after Florida required schools to teach African American history, how the subject is taught remains inconsistent across Florida classrooms, a review by The Associated Press has found",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Buried among Florida's manicured golf courses and sprawling suburbs are the artifacts of its slave-holding past: the long-lost cemeteries of enslaved people, the statutes of Confederate soldiers that still stand watch over town squares, the old plantations turned into modern subdivisions that bear the same name. But many students aren't learning that kind of Black history in Florida classrooms.",
      "In an old wooden bungalow in Delray Beach, Charlene Farrington and her staff gather groups of teenagers on Saturday mornings to teach them lessons she worries that public schools won't provide. They talk about South Florida's Caribbean roots, the state's dark history of lynchings, how segregation still shapes the landscape and how grassroots activists mobilized the Civil Rights Movement to upend generations of oppression.",
      "\u201cYou need to know how it happened before so you can decide how you want it to happen again,\" she told her students as they sat as their desks, the morning light illuminating historic photographs on the walls.",
      "Florida students are giving up their Saturday mornings to learn about African American history at the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum in Delray Beach and in similar programs at community centers across the state. Many are supported by Black churches, which for generations have helped forge the cultural and political identity of their parishioners.",
      "Since Faith in Florida developed its own Black history toolkit last year, more than 400 congregations have pledged to teach the lessons, the advocacy group says.",
      "Florida has required public schools to teach African American history for the past 30 years, but many families no longer trust the state's education system to adequately address the subject.",
      "By the state\u2019s own metrics, just a dozen Florida school districts have demonstrated excellence at teaching Black history, by providing evidence that they are incorporating the content into lessons throughout the school year and getting buy-in from the school board and community partners.",
      "School district officials across Florida told The Associated Press that they are still following the state mandate to teach about the experience of enslavement, abolition and the \"vital contributions of African Americans to build and strengthen American society.\u201d",
      "But a common complaint from students and parents is that the instruction seems limited to heroic figures like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and rarely extends beyond each February's Black History Month.",
      "When Sulaya Williams' eldest child started school, she couldn't find the comprehensive instruction she wanted for him in their area. So in 2016, she launched her own organization to teach Black history in community settings.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to make sure that our children knew our stories, to be able to pass down to their children,\" Williams said.",
      "Williams now has a contract to teach Saturday school at a public library in Fort Lauderdale, and her 12-year-old daughter Addah Gordon invites her classmates to join her.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m really learning my culture. Like I\u2019m learning what my ancestors did,\u201d Addah said. \u201cAnd most people don\u2019t know what they did.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers unanimously approved the African American history requirement in 1994 at a time of atonement over Florida's history.",
      "Historians commissioned by the state had just published an official report on the deadly attack on the town of Rosewood in 1923, when a white mob razed the majority-Black community and drove out its residents. When the Florida Legislature approved financial compensation for Rosewood's survivors and descendants in 1994, it was seen as a national model for reparations.",
      "\u201cThere was a moment of enlightenment in Florida, those decades ago. There really was,\" said Marvin Dunn, who has authored multiple books on Black Floridians. \u201cBut that was short-lived.\u201d",
      "Three decades later, the teaching of African American history remains inconsistent across Florida classrooms, inadequate in the eyes of some advocates, and is under fire by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has championed efforts to restrict how race, history and discrimination can be talked about in the state\u2019s public schools.",
      "DeSantis has led attacks on \u201cwokeness\u201d in education that rallied conservatives nationwide, including President-elect Donald Trump. In 2022, the governor signed a law restricting certain race-based conversations in schools and businesses and prohibits teaching that members of one ethnic group should feel guilt or bear responsibility for actions taken by previous generations.",
      "Last year, DeSantis\u2019 administration blocked a new Advanced Placement course on African American Studies from being taught in Florida, saying it violates state law and is historically inaccurate.",
      "A spokesperson for the College Board, which oversees Advanced Placement courses, told the AP they are not aware of any public schools in Florida currently offering the African American Studies class. It's also not listed in the state's current course directory.",
      "Representatives for the Florida Department of Education and the state's African American History Task Force did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.",
      "\u201cPeople who are interested in advancing African diaspora history can\u2019t rely on schools to do that,\u201d said Tameka Bradley Hobbs, manager of Broward County's African-American Research Library and Cultural Center. \"I think it\u2019s even more clear now that there needs to be a level of self-reliance and self-determination when it comes to passing on the history and heritage of our ancestors.\u201d",
      "Last year, only 30 of Florida's 67 traditional school districts offered at least one standalone course on African American history or humanities, according to state data. While not required by state law, having a dedicated Black history class is a measure of how districts are following the state mandate.",
      "Florida's large urban districts are far more likely to offer the classes, compared to small rural districts, some of which have fewer than 2,000 students.",
      "Even in districts that have staff dedicated to teaching Black history, some teachers are afraid of violating state law, according to Brian Knowles, who oversees African American, Holocaust and Latino studies for the Palm Beach County school district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many other districts and so many kids that we\u2019re missing because we\u2019re tiptoeing around what is essentially American history,\u201d Knowles said.",
      "Frustration over the restrictions that teachers face pushed Renee O'Connor to take a sabbatical last year from her job teaching Black history at Miami Norland Senior High School in the majority-Black city of Miami Gardens. Now, she is back in the classroom, but she also has been helping community groups develop their own Black history programs outside of the public school system.",
      "\u201cI wish, obviously, all kids were able to take an African American history class,\u201d O'Connor said, \u201cbut you have to pivot if it\u2019s not happening in schools.\u201d",

      "Farmers in Georgia are still reeling more than two months after Hurricane Helene blew away cotton, destroyed ripened squash and cucumbers and uprooted pecan trees and timber",
      "LYONS, Ga. -- Twisted equipment and snapped tree limbs still litter Chris Hopkins\u2019 Georgia farm more than two months after Hurricane Helene made its deadly march across the South.",
      "An irrigation sprinkler system about 300 feet (92 meters) long lay overturned in a field, its steel pipes bent and welded joints broken. The mangled remains of a grain bin sat crumpled by a road. On a Friday in early December, Hopkins dragged burly limbs from the path of the tractor-like machine that picks his cotton crop six rows at a time.",
      "\u201cI have wrestled with lots of emotions the past two months,\u201d said Hopkins, who also grows corn and peanuts in rural Toombs County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of Savannah. \u201cDo we just get through this one and quit? Do we build back? It is emotionally draining.\u201d",
      "Hopkins is among farmers across the South who are still reeling from Helene\u2019s devastation. The storm made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26 as a major Category 4 storm and then raced north across Georgia and neighboring states.",
      "Experts estimate the cost to farmers, timber growers and other agribusinesses from Florida to Virginia will reach more than $10 billion. The toll includes ravaged crops, uprooted timber, wrecked farm equipment and mangled chicken houses, as well as indirect costs such as lost productivity at cotton gins and poultry processing plants.",
      "For cotton growers like Hopkins, Helene hit just as the fall harvest was starting. Many put most cleanup on hold to try to salvage what remained of their crops.",
      "Georgia farmers suffered storm losses of at least $5.5 billion, according to an analysis by the University of Georgia. In North Carolina, a state agency calculated farmers suffered $3.1 billion in crop losses and recovery costs after Helene brought record rainfall and flooding. Separate economic analyses of farm damage tallied losses of up to $630 million in Virginia, $452 million in South Carolina and $162 million in Florida.",
      "Hopkins figures he lost half the cotton on his 1,400 acres (560 hectares).",
      "\u201cWe were at the most vulnerable stage we could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lint was open and fluffy and hanging there, waiting to be defoliated or picked. About 50% of the harvestable lint ended up on the ground.\u201d",
      "Even with insurance, Hopkins said, he won't recoup an estimated $430,000 in losses from his cotton crop alone. That doesn't include the cost of debris removal, repairing or replacing damaged machinery and the loss of two small pecan orchards uprooted by the storm.",
      "The storm ripped through blooming cotton fields, pecan orchards laden with nuts and fields where fall vegetables like cucumbers and squash awaited picking. Hundreds of large poultry houses used to raise thousands of chickens at a time got destroyed.",
      "Farmers far from Helene's center weren't spared, as tropical-storm force winds reached outward up to 310 miles (499 kilometers).",
      "\u201cIt was staggering,\u201d said Timothy Coolong, a University of Georgia horticulture professor. \u201cThis may be just too much for some folks.\"",
      "Helene was one of the deadliest U.S. hurricanes in nearly two decades, killing more than 200 people. It left more than 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed across the South.",
      "Georgia's government in November diverted $100 million that had been set aside for construction projects or paying off existing debt to fund emergency loans to farmers and cleanup in Helene's aftermath. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has made additional storm relief a priority for the upcoming legislative session.",
      "But Georgia's constitution prohibits using state funds to give direct disaster aid to individuals and private businesses.",
      "In Congress, a new plan late Friday that would temporarily fund federal operations included billions in disaster aid to farmers.",
      "\u201cWe need help, but we need it quick,\" said Jeffrey Pridgen, a fifth-generation farmer who raises chickens in south Georgia\u2019s Coffee County.",
      "Pridgen operated a dozen poultry houses, each large enough to raise up to 20,000 chickens at a time. Helene destroyed four of them, along with thousands of chickens. Only one of Pridgen's houses remains in working condition, the others having been badly damaged.",
      "Pridgen said new chicken houses will cost about $450,000 apiece. Because most of his were decades old, he expects insurance to cover just half the cost.",
      "\u201cI was looking at retirement, but I lost my retirement and my income in one day,\u201d said Pridgen, 62. \"It\u2019ll be two years before we get fully operational again. I\u2019m basically starting over.\u201d",
      "Georgia\u2019s poultry industry took an estimated $683 million hit, with farmers having to rebuild about 300 chicken houses and repair hundreds more.",
      "The poultry processing plant that relies on Pridgen and other storm-impacted farmers for chickens is now operating just four days per week, he said.",
      "\u201cNow for at least a year, perhaps a little bit longer, we\u2019re in rebuilding mode,\" said Mike Giles, president of the Georgia Poultry Federation. \"That affects production in an area for an extended period of time.\u201d",
      "Helene's devastation shouldn't have much impact on consumer prices because crops grown elsewhere can make up for most shortages, said Michael Adjemian, a University of Georgia professor of agricultural economics. Pecans are one possible exception. Georgia is responsible for roughly one-third of U.S. production.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, even a terrible storm like this is going to have a relatively small impact,\u201d Adjemian said. \"And maybe it's not even noticeable, depending on the product.\u201d",
      "Helene cost Georgia cotton farmers roughly one-third of their crop, with direct and indirect losses valued at $560 million. Some were still recovering from Hurricane Michael in 2018.",
      "Cotton growers also were facing low prices this harvest season of around 70 cents per pound (0.45 kilograms), said Taylor Sills, executive director of the Georgia Cotton Commission. That meant they needed a big yield to turn any profit.",
      "\u201cTimes were awful, and then they got hit by a hurricane,\u201d Sills said. \"There are people who lost everything and there are people who didn\u2019t. But everybody lost something.\"",

      "For Christians around the world, Christmas is the joyful celebration of the birth of Jesus. To affirm their beliefs \u2014 that God is present and hasn\u2019t abandoned them \u2014 the faith community at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is embracing its holiday traditions just days after a deadly shooting there.",
      "\u201cWhen people say, \u2018Where is your God?\u2019 He is more evident now than he\u2019s ever been to us,\u201d the Rev. Sarah Karlen told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m sure the phrase \u2018Prince of Peace\u2019 and \u2018God with us\u2019 is going to be leaned into a little more this year.\u201d",
      "Karlen is a pastor at City Church, which in the late 1970s founded the school where she\u2019s also the theater teacher. This weekend, the church will hold the funeral of a 14-year-old student, Rubi Patricia Vergara, killed Monday when another student opened fire, also killing a teacher and wounding several others at the school on the same campus.",
      "\u201cWhen we say that God is with us, especially here at Christmas time \u2014 when we say, you know, Emmanuel \u2018God with us,\u2019 that he came to Earth to be with us \u2014 I know beyond a shadow of a doubt each and every one of us here at City Church would say that in a very new way,\u201d Karlen added.",
      "Decked in holiday light displays, including Christmas trees and a Nativity scene, the evangelical, nondenominational church with over 1,200 members also hosted a vigil service Tuesday.",
      "Then, drawing from Scripture and particularly the Book of Job, pastors addressed the challenge of reconciling faith in a loving God with his allowing great suffering to occur.",
      "Karlen also challenged some of the taunts on the school\u2019s social media that questioned its religious beliefs. To the assembly\u2019s applause, she repeatedly affirmed God\u2019s presence in the midst of the grieving and the weariness.",
      "\u201cNone of us on our staff are saying that we understand why or how something happened. But we do understand that God sees us, sees things very differently than we do,\u201d Karlen said later.",
      "Police are continuing to investigate why Natalie \u201cSamantha\u201d Rupnow, 15, attacked the school before fatally shooting herself. While dozens of school shootings have happened across the U.S. in recent years, the vast majority are carried out by teenage boys and young men.",
      "Barbara Wiers said faith is helping teachers, students and families make peace with the possibility they will never have complete answers.",
      "\u201cThere may never be sense made out of this senseless tragedy. But. God, right? God understands, and God was there, and God is still here,\u201d said Wiers, the school\u2019s director for elementary education and communications. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not about man\u2019s judgment, although there\u2019s going to be all of that \u2014 because of the legal system and how that plays out. But God\u2019s just judgment will reign. And we trust him for that.\u201d",
      "The school remains closed as staff work to repair the physical damage so that it won\u2019t retraumatize teachers and students immediately upon their return, Wiers said. Safety and wellness protocols are also being reviewed.",
      "But on Christmas Eve, City Church plans to hold caroling and candlelight services, hoping that the community will draw comfort from the familiar traditions.",
      "\u201cWe know this is a long road for all of us, but the start is to be in the presence of God with one another, and to hug one another, and to sing together, to pray together,\u201d Karlen said.",
      "Other churches affiliated with the school, as well as the broader community in Madison, quickly came together to help, from alumni starting food drives to evangelical ministries sending chaplains to pastors sitting up with those hospitalized.",
      "\u201cHealing will come slowly, but they will not be left alone,\u201d said the Rev. Kerri Parker, executive director of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, whose member organizations include about 2,000 churches and 1 million Christians.",
      "Abundant Life Christian School is part of Impact Christian Schools, a network of private educational institutions that welcome families regardless of their creed, said Impact\u2019s executive director Chuck Moore.",
      "Moore said he hoped the shooting\u2019s occurrence so close to the holidays wouldn\u2019t forever tie Christmas with tragedy for the community.",
      "\u201cEven in the midst of awful, it\u2019s still a time we can rejoice,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe can focus our celebration on who Christ is.\u201d",
      "Already teachers at the school have talked about Jesus and faith in \u201cevery classroom, every subject, all day long, because God isn\u2019t siloed to Sunday,\u201d Wiers said. And that focus will continue when the school reopens sometime in January.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re changed. Our family is changed. But God hasn\u2019t changed. He didn\u2019t move. He hasn\u2019t been altered at all,\u201d Wiers said. \u201cAnd the message hasn\u2019t changed. God is good. God is good all the time. He is faithful and he is true. And while we are brokenhearted, he\u2019s going to walk us through this.\u201d",

      "The park service said in a statement that the plan was was signed Thursday and will take effect in 180 days, barring any legal challenges. It will ban the tours over the park and within a half mile (800 meters) outside its boundary.",
      "\u201cProhibiting commercial air tours protects these lands\u2019 cultural and spiritual significance to the Navajo Nation,\u201d said park Superintendent Lyn Carranza. \u201cCanyon de Chelly National Monument\u2019s Air Tour Management Plan honors the unique nation-to-nation relationship regarding decisions affecting the park and helps to preserve one of the most important archeological landscapes in the southwest.\u201d",
      "The park lies within the Four Corners region inside the Navajo Nation and is among the most visited national monuments in the United States. It's known for its soaring sandstone cliffs and 800-foot (244-meter) high Spider Rock spire. Prehistoric rock art is found throughout the area, which has been home to Native Americans for millennia.",
      "The sightseeing flights reportedly date back to the 1930s, when crews building the Hoover Dam on the Arizona-Nevada border asked helicopter pilots working on the project to give flyovers to their families.",
      "The tours offering a unique overhead view of spectacular landscapes have long been popular at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. Some of the nation\u2019s busiest spots for tour operators have included Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which is home to one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes, and Haleakala National Park.",
      "Supporters of the tours say they offer an exciting experience to tourists and allow older people and those with disabilities to see and enjoy the parks. Critics say the flights are an unnecessarily dangerous way to view some of the most stunning public lands in the United States.",
      "Rules designating routes and minimum altitudes were set in 1986 after two tour aircraft collided over the Grand Canyon, killing 25 people. Still, there are currently numerous options for helicopter tours to the Grand Canyon, departing from places including Las Vegas and Sedona, Arizona.",
      "Critics also complain that the buzz of helicopters drowns out the sounds of nature, disrupting the experiences of visitors on the ground and tribal members who call the land around the parks home.",
      "The park service works with the FAA to implement the National Park Air Tour Management Act of 2000, which requires tour operators who want to conduct such commercial air tours to get FAA approval. The law also requires the FAA, in conjunction with the park service, to establish management plans for air tours for those parks and nearby tribal lands where applications are made.",
      "Canyon de Chelly is the last of roughly two dozen national park units where the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility had fought for flyover restrictions. Other national parks where such commercial flyovers essentially are or will be banned in coming years include Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, Glacier National Park in Montana, and Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico. Only two air tours per year are allowed at Death Valley National Park along the California-Nevada border."

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Former top Coast Guard officials hid a yearslong investigation into sexual assault and harassment at the service's academy from both Congress and the public after leaders debated the fallout from a potential disclosure, according to a U.S. Senate committee report released Friday.",
      "Coast Guard officials also took steps to remove references to the investigation, named Operation Fouled Anchor, from records submitted to Congress, according to the report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The report followed similar findings released last week by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s report confirms and provides additional powerful evidence that the cover-up of sexual assault in the Coast Guard was deliberate and purposeful and longstanding,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, said Friday. \u201cThe public deserves an explanation. So do the survivors.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Coast Guard is keenly aware of and is aggressively responding to the unacceptable activities underpinning the report \u2014 namely sexual assault and sexual harassment,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Coast Guard is working proactively to prevent and reduce these devastating crimes, secure justice for survivors and provide the care and support victims need and deserve.\u201d",
      "Messages to officials at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, were not immediately returned Friday. The Coast Guard previously apologized for how it handled sexual misconduct complaints and said it has made numerous improvements.",
      "Operation Fouled Anchor ran from 2014 to 2019. The investigation reviewed more than 100 allegations of sexual assault at the academy made from the early 1990s to 2006 and how they were handled. Coast Guard officials, however, did not fully disclose its existence to Congress or the public until last year. The existence of the investigation was first reported by CNN.",
      "The investigation found that dozens of sexual assault and harassment cases involving academy cadets had been mishandled by the school, including the prevention of some perpetrators from being prosecuted.",
      "When the investigation did become public, it sparked calls for reform and accountability for offenders and those who protected them. They also resulted in multiple government investigations and formal complaints by more than 20 former cadets who said they were sexually assaulted.",

Ray also wrote the \u201cproblem is one of the past,\u201d according to the subcommittee.",
      "Other Coast Guard officials presented three scenarios for how to handle Operation Fouled Anchor, with a recommendation to only discuss it if asked by Congress, the subcommittee said.",
      "The officials recommended against fully notifying Congress, writing that \u201cany affirmative Congressional or external communication, especially if briefed under a singular investigatory moniker with a colorful title, vice separate investigations, will risk the initiation of comprehensive Congressional investigations, hearings, and media interest,\u201d according to the subcommittee.",
      "Phone and text messages left at a listing for Schultz were not immediately returned Friday. Contact information for Ray could not immediately be found.",
      "Schultz told CNN in an interview last week that he withheld the investigation from Congress because he was concerned elected officials would not protect victims' privacy. He also denied allegations of a coverup and said he believed there was no legal obligation to give the investigation report to Congress.",
      "Schultz and Ray became the top leaders of the Coast Guard in 2018. The previous leaders told the subcommittee that they had intended to disclose Operation Foul Anchor to Congress and the public.",
      "Friday's report also said the Coast Guard drafted at least 17 versions of a final report for Operation Foul Anchor. The longest, at 26 pages, detailed assaults at the academy. The final version was six pages and omitted much of the information in earlier drafts, the subcommittee said.",
      "The subcommittee's report also accused Coast Guard officials of repeatedly failing to comply with the panel's investigation including by failing to produce documents, \u201caggressively\u201d redacting documents and erroneously claiming some documents were privileged.",
      "The Coast Guard responded that it has undergone an extensive effort to provide requested documents to Congress, including examining more than 1.8 million pages of emails, and has complied with congressional requests for information \u201cto the fullest extent.\u201d",
      "The Senate subcommittee said its investigation is continuing.",
      "\u201cWith the decision to keep Operation Fouled Anchor from Congress and the public, the Coast Guard failed itself and its members who survived sexual assault and sexual harassment during their time in the service,\u201d the subcommittee's report said."

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A white former Kansas City police officer who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a Black man was released from prison Friday after Missouri\u2019s governor commuted his sentence to parole.",
      "The decision by Republican Gov. Mike Parson to free Eric DeValkenaere came after months of public debate about the case, which had fueled both racial justice protests and impassioned pleas for mercy from DeValkenaere's supporters who asserted he had been unjustly convicted.",
      "DeValkenaere was serving a six-year prison sentence. He was convicted in 2021 of killing 26-year-old Cameron Lamb as he backed into his garage. Lamb\u2019s name was invoked frequently during racial injustice protests in Kansas City in 2020 following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Lamb\u2019s family even met with then-President Donald Trump that year.",
      "Parson did not pardon DeValkenaere but rather shortened his sentence to parole, subject to normal restrictions against possessing firearms, traveling out of state without permission and other items. He granted a similar commutation of parole to Patty Prewitt, another high-profile prisoner who had spent 40 years behind bars for her husband\u2019s killing.",
      "The Department of Corrections confirmed both were freed Friday afternoon, before Parson publicly announced his decisions. DeValkenaere had been held in an out-of-state prison for his own safety, said Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann.",
      "Jason Johnson, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, which supports DeValkenaere, said they \u201cwill continue to fight to completely clear\u201d his name. Johnson said in a statement that DeValkenaere had an outstanding record of service, adding: \"While we strongly maintain that Eric is completely innocent, even those who do not must recognize that the ends of justice are not served by his incarceration.\u201d",
      "The clemency announcements came just weeks before Parson is to end his term, capping a historic string of such actions. Parson, a former rural sheriff, has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 800 people while clearing a backlog of more than 3,500 clemency requests he inherited upon taking office in June 2018. That's the most granted clemency cases of any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Most granted clemency had been convicted of lower-level crimes involving drugs or theft. But Parson also denied more than 3,000 clemency petitions.",
      "Gwendolyn Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, said the DeValkenaere clemency decision will tarnish Parson's legacy and \u201cwill fuel deeper divisions and ignite justified outrage.\"",
      "Grant called Parson's decision \u201cnothing short of a flagrant endorsement of systemic racism and a betrayal of justice. By freeing a convicted officer who unlawfully killed Cameron Lamb, a young Black man, the governor has made it crystal clear that Black lives do not matter in the state of Missouri under his leadership.\u201d",
      "At trial, DeValkenaere testified that he fired his weapon on Dec. 3, 2019, after Lamb pointed a gun at another detective, Troy Schwalm, and that he believed his actions saved his partner\u2019s life.",
      "Prosecutors, however, argued that police shouldn\u2019t have been on the property and staged the shooting scene to support their claims that Lamb was armed.",
      "\u201cDeValkenaere was convicted for killing an unarmed man. Period,\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a social media post Friday. \u201cHe was shown incredible mercy by the Governor. No such mercy was shown to the victims. Today we will focus our time caring for Cameron\u2019s family rather than commenting further.\u201d",
      "Messages left with attorneys for the Lamb family were not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Evidence presented during the trial, which was held without a jury at DeValkenaere\u2019s request, showed that DeValkenaere kicked over a barricade to get into Lamb's backyard.",
      "The trial judge, Dale Youngs, said the officers had no warrant for Lamb\u2019s arrest and had no search warrant or consent to be on the property. He called it a tragic case with troubling facts and said DeValkenaere and the officer with him escalated a situation that had been calmed. He didn\u2019t address allegations that evidence had been planted.",
      "DeValkenaere left the police force after his conviction but remained free on bond until he lost his appeal in October 2023. The Missouri Supreme Court subsequently declined to hear an appeal.",
      "DeValkenaere\u2019s wife, Sarah DeValkenaere, took to social media earlier this week \u2014 as she had done often \u2014 urging followers to request a pardon.",
      "\u201cI miss him so much,\u201d she said in a message on X in November. \u201cSo sad that an officer who dedicated his life to serving our city is now in prison for doing his job.\u201d",
      "Parson did not not offer an explanation for his clemency decisions while announcing them Friday. But he had previously acknowledged the pressure in an interview in August on KCMO Talk Radio.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a week that goes by that somebody\u2019s not reaching out to me about that issue, and we\u2019re going to see what happens here before long. I\u2019ll leave it at that. But you know, I don\u2019t like where he\u2019s at. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d Parson said.",
      "Prewitt, now 75, had filed multiple clemency requests over the years. She was serving a life sentence after being convicted of fatally shooting her husband, Bill Prewitt, in 1984 as he slept in their home in the rural east-central Missouri town of Holden.",
      "Prewitt, a mother of five, said a stranger broke into the house. She declined a plea deal that would have given her the chance for parole after five to seven years. Prosecutors said Prewitt cheated on her husband and her ex-lovers testified at trial in 1985 that she had talked about killing Bill Prewitt.",
      "But Patty Prewitt\u2019s backers argued that her relationship with her husband was improving and that the evidence of her infidelity would not be allowed in court today. In addition, Georgetown University law students examining the case found prosecutors failed to tell defense attorneys that two days after Prewitt\u2019s husband was killed, a neighbor told investigators she had seen a man parked at the end of a nearby dirt road in heavy rain on the night of the murder.",

      "A sheriff in rural, coastal Oregon says he's concerned about letters asking residents to collect information on immigrants",
      "LINCOLN CITY, Ore. -- A sheriff in Oregon says he has contacted the FBI and is increasingly concerned about a letter circulating in his rural, coastal community asking people to write down the license plate numbers of possible immigrants.",
      "The Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office issued a news release on Thursday condemning the letters that have appeared across the county, describing them as divisive. Sheriff Curtis Landers told KPTV that he contacted federal authorities after receiving such a letter himself.",
      "The FBI said Friday it was aware of the mailings. In a statement, it encouraged community members who feel physically threatened to report their concerns to law enforcement.",
      "The letter tells the recipient to be on alert while sitting in their church parking lot or waiting in line to pick up their children at school, so as to write down the license plate numbers of cars believed to belong to immigrants who might lack permanent legal status.",
      "The sheriff's office said it was committed to upholding Oregon\u2019s sanctuary law, which prohibits local police in most cases from inquiring about an individual\u2019s immigration or citizenship status and sharing that information with federal authorities.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraging our community members to do the right thing and use compassion as we encounter these types of messages,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in its news release. \u201cWe strongly advise against engaging in activities such as those outlined in this letter, including collecting or sharing information about individuals based on their demographic or perceived immigration status.\u201d",
      "Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum similarly condemned the letters. \u201cAttempts to intimidate our communities and their leaders through racist letter writing campaigns has no place in Oregon, and we will continue to stand together in opposition to those who seek to divide us,\u201d she said in a statement Friday.",
      "The Associated Press emailed the sheriff\u2019s office on Friday, requesting comment and asking about the number and distribution method of the letters. When reached by phone, the sheriff\u2019s office said Landers and its spokesperson were both out of the office and unable to respond to calls or emails that day.",
      "Landers received a copy of the letter in his mailbox, according to KPTV. Elsewhere in the county, the mayor and city councilors of the small town of Toledo and the mayor of Lincoln City also received copies in the mail, KGW reported.",
      "In response to Trump\u2019s vows to conduct mass deportations during his second term, advocacy groups across the country have hosted know-your-rights trainings to teach immigrants how to protect themselves and their loved ones. The trainings are underway in immigrant-friendly states including California and Illinois \u2014 which both enacted protections for immigrants in response to Trump\u2019s focus on enforcement during his first administration \u2014 and those with more stringent laws affecting immigrants such as Florida.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in a growing number of Republican-led states are proposing to give local law officers the power to arrest people who entered the country illegally, mirroring recent laws in Texas and elsewhere that have been placed on hold while courts weigh whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal authority.",
      "Oregon became the first sanctuary state in 1987. Its law bars local and state police from participating in federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant, and also prohibits private immigration detention facilities from operating in the state.",
      "Oregon's sanctuary law has been updated and strengthened over the years, including in 2021, when the Legislature passed a measure creating a hotline for reporting violations of the law."

      "Minneapolis has softened an ordinance that prohibited obstructing entrances and driveways to abortion clinics after anti-abortion activists sued to challenge it on free-speech grounds",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minneapolis has softened an ordinance that prohibited the obstruction of entrances and driveways to abortion clinics after anti-abortion activists sued to challenge it on free-speech grounds.",
      "The City Council this month quietly amended the ordinance to exclude constitutionally protected activities and agreed to pay the plaintiffs' legal fees. Brian Gibson, chief executive officer of Pro-Life Action Ministries, said in an interview Friday that it amounted to an admission by the city that the law violated the freedom of speech.",
      "\u201cThey were accepting fault for having violated our constitutional rights,\u201d Gibson said.",
      "Pro-Life Action Ministries sends \u201csidewalk counselors\u201d to Planned Parenthood clinics in Minneapolis, St. Paul and elsewhere to try to dissuade people from having abortions. The ordinance, which the city enacted in 2022, was designed to protect patients of the Planned Parenthood clinic in the Uptown neighborhood from group members who would approach patients as they drove into the parking lot there. Gibson said they never blocked any entrances, but would try to get people to roll down their windows to take literature or talk.",
      "Minneapolis was the only city the state with such a rule. Gibson said their most immediate concern when they filed the lawsuit in 2023 was to overturn the Minneapolis ordinance, but he acknowledged that they also wanted to prevent St. Paul, where there's a much busier Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, from adopting something similar, which it never did.",
      "The final judgement in favor of Pro-Life Action Ministries and three of its sidewalk counselors was filed in federal court Thursday.",
      "Nationwide, several people have been convicted in the last year alone under the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, known as the FACE Act, or similar laws for physically blockading abortion clinic entrances. That includes activists in Detroit, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Mount Juliet, Tennessee, with some getting prison sentences as high as three to five years.",
      "Toward the end of a long meeting that dealt mostly with other topics on Dec. 5, the Minneapolis City Council went into closed session to approve the agreement on legal fees, then returned in a very brief open session to unanimously exempt \u201cany person or group engaging in conduct protected by the United States Constitution, the Minnesota Constitution or federal or Minnesota law.\u201d",
      "The law still prohibits physically blocking clinic entrances, and the city council's vice president, Aisha Chughtai, said it's consistent with the FACE Act.",
      "She said the council wants to make sure people have access to heath care, including abortions, and voiced support for Planned Parenthood.",
      "\u201cWe also want to be sure to provide very specific carveouts to ensure First Amendment rights are protected and ensure our local authority remains intact,\u201d she told her colleagues at the meeting.",
      "Chughtai did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday. In response to a request for comment from the city attorney's office, a city spokesperson supplied a statement that was nearly identical to what Chughtai said at the council meeting.",
      "\u201cThey amended their ordinance and repaired the damage that was done there. It was total victory for the free-speech folks,\u201d said Peter Breen, head of litigation for the conservative Thomas More Society, which represented the plaintiffs.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States, which was not a party to the lawsuit, said in a statement that under the revision, \u201cPatients continue to be protected from people blocking or obstructing the driveway or sidewalk.\u201d",
      "Breen said they\u2019ll file a bill for the attorney\u2019s fees soon, but that their last estimate was in the $600,000 range.",
      "The Thomas More Society and allied groups are litigating similar restrictions nationwide, Breen said. They\u2019ve asked a federal appeals court to block a similar ordinance in Clearwater, Florida. They\u2019re also fighting similar measures in Westchester County of New York, San Diego, and Detroit.",
      "And they\u2019ve asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear a challenge to an ordinance in Carbondale, Illinois. While the Supreme Court in 2000 affirmed a Colorado buffer zone requirement in a case called Hill v. Colorado, Breen noted that the high court more recently in its Dobbs decision, which struck down the constitutional right to abortion, criticized the Hill decision, saying its previous abortion rulings \u201chave distorted First Amendment doctrines.\u201d",
      "Gibson said his members sometimes succeed in persuading people who come to the Minnesota clinics to cancel their abortions. He said they gather outside the St. Paul clinic nearly every day, and even go there Sundays when it's closed just to pray. And he said they had a victory on their first day back outside the Minneapolis clinic when they approached a woman who had parked on the street.",
      "\u201cWe had a baby saved,\u201d he said. \u201cA woman decided not to go through with her abortion appointment.\u201d"

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Friday announced he is pardoning 43 people who have served out their sentences, stressing that his actions are \u201cvery different\u201d than President Joe Biden's recent wave of commutations.",
      "Lee's latest clemency moves are nearly double his next highest total for a single year.",
      "But this time around, Lee specifically noted that he chose not to shorten any sentences \u2014 known as commutations \u2014 in his yearly announcement of clemency actions around Christmas. He aimed to distance his approach from Biden's, saying the people he pardoned in Tennessee have finished their sentences and rejoined their communities, and each had a recommendation from the state Board of Parole. Lee has issued seven commutations since taking office in 2019.",
      "Last week, Biden commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and pardoned 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes, marking the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. Some of the clemency actions drew community backlash. The clemency push followed a broad pardon for the Democrat's son Hunter, who has been convicted of federal felony gun and tax crimes.",
      "\u201cThese are very different individuals than many of the individuals whose sentences were commuted in the previous federal clemency grant,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "In Tennessee, a pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness to someone who has completed their prison sentence and are no longer incarcerated, while commutation shortens a sentence but lets the conviction stand. Lee has only issued one exoneration while in office, in which the governor declares that the applicant didn\u2019t commit the crime. Other governors are likewise issuing acts of clemency around the holidays.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, whom Lee supports, has drawn scrutiny for clemency actions as well \u2014 helping a slate of well-connected people in his first term, and promising to start his next administration with pardons for people who were arrested for their role in the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The governor's office said none of the people he pardoned Friday have had an active criminal sentence for at least five years, including probation or parole.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been out, but they\u2019ve also shown a compelling reason and interest for getting a pardon and have shown exemplary citizenship,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee highlighted several cases, including that of Lanesha Faye Brown. Lee said Brown was convicted of attempted second-degree murder in 1998 at 13 years old after she had been bullied at school and, in one circumstance, tried to retaliate with a small knife for an art class project when a bully attacked her. He said she now has been married for 15 years, earned an associate's degree, and has worked at a Nashville hotel. She was once fired because of a background check, but her hotel coworkers and manager rallied to get her rehired, Lee said.",
      "The clemency actions follow an election cycle in which Republicans nationally leaned on tough-on-crime messaging, which has also been a focal point for Tennessee's Legislature in recent years. Lee, meanwhile, was elected governor in 2018 on a message that included criminal justice reform priorities. He has said clemency decisions and criminal justice reform are unrelated.",
      "Last year, Lee approved 22 pardons and commuted one person\u2019s sentence. He issued 13 pardons and three commutations in 2022, and in 2021 he pardoned 13 people, signed off on three commutations and exonerated one person.",
      "Lee's predecessor, former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam, granted nine commutations, 35 pardons, and one exoneration over eight years in office."

But in addition to conducting controlled buys from suspected drug dealers as directed by investigators, the informant said he was compelled by Cole and another agent to also engage in illegal sales.",
      "The investigation began after the informant\u2019s defense attorney contacted the U.S. Attorney in Utah in October to report that agents had required him to engage in potentially illegal acts dating from last spring to early December. Details of drug sales offered by the informant were confirmed through surveillance and other sources, the FBI said.",
      "Cole and the second agent \u2014 identified in court documents only as \u201cPerson A\u201d \u2014 profited up to $300,000 from the illegal scheme, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case.",
      "FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker said Friday that \u201cPerson A\u201d had not been arrested or charged, but the investigation was ongoing.",
      "Cole, 50, of South Jordan, Utah, entered the courtroom Friday handcuffed and hunched over, wearing a white and gray, striped jumpsuit. U.S. Magistrate Judge Dustin Pead accepted Cole's not guilty plea and scheduled a trial for the week of Feb. 24.",
      "Federal officials say Cole\u2019s indictment sends a message that officers who break the law and undermine the public\u2019s trust in law enforcement will be prosecuted.",

      "Special Agent Shohini Sinha, who leads the FBI's Salt Lake City field office, said Cole\u2019s alleged actions helped fuel an already devastating drug crisis.",
      "Ingestion of synthetic bath salts, also known as Alpha-PVP or cathinone, can lead to bizarre behavior such as paranoia and extreme strength, according to authorities who say it\u2019s similar to methamphetamine, cocaine or ecstasy. They are unrelated to actual bathing products.",
      "Cole\u2019s attorney, Alexander Ramos, has declined to directly address the criminal allegations but said his client has a strong reputation within the federal law enforcement community. Ramos did not immediately respond Friday to emails seeking comment on the not guilty plea.",
      "The Homeland Security Investigations department where Cole worked conducts federal criminal investigations into the illegal movement of people, goods, money, weapons, drugs and sensitive technology into, out of and across the U.S. Cole and the second agent had their credentials suspended but have not been fired, according to court documents."

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 13:54:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Huge gates at the mouths of three inlets and barriers across bays are no longer part of a plan to protect New Jersey&rsquo;s back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy",
    "story": [
      "Huge gates at the mouths of three inlets and barriers across bays are no longer part of a plan to protect New Jersey\u2019s back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy",
      "MANASQUAN, N.J. -- The federal government has dropped huge gates at the mouths of three inlets, as well as internal waterway barriers from a plan to protect New Jersey's back bays from the type of catastrophic flooding they endured during Superstorm Sandy.",
      "Instead, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a plan released Friday wants to rely more on elevating thousands of homes, hardening police and fire stations, hospitals and critical infrastructure, and restoring salt marshes to act as natural sponges capable of absorbing floodwaters during severe storms.",
      "The changes would reduce the cost of the plan from $16 billion to $7.6 billion, and remove a major point of contention raised by homeowners, environmentalists and some local governments concerned about damage to the views of inlets and bays, potential harm to fish and wildlife, and the cost of maintaining the massive projects, which local governments would have to pay.",
      "But the scaled-down project would be less effective, the Army Corps acknowledged.",
      "\u201cThe storm surge barrier analyses remains valuable, and can be revisited at a future phase, but they ultimately required years of engineering work and environmental coordination, and we wanted to release a plan with elements that could be move forward in the near term,\u201d said Stephen Rochette, a spokesman for the Army Corps.",
      "Without some sort of storm protection plan, New Jersey's back bay regions could sustain $2.6 billion a year in flood-related damage to property, infrastructure and vehicles each year between 2040 and 2090, the Corps projected. The study covered the area from Neptune in Monmouth County all the way to the state\u2019s southern tip in Cape May.",
      "The original recommendation called for large storm gates across the Manasquan, Barnegat and Great Egg Harbor inlets. In addition, so-called \u201ccross-bay barriers\u201d would have been erected in Absecon Bay near Atlantic City, and along a former railroad right of way along 52nd Street in Ocean City.",
      "These bay barriers would have had a swing gate in the middle that could be shut during major storms, and slat-like gates spanning about a third of a mile that would be lowered down into the water to block surges of water during storms. The structures would have risen about 20 feet (about 6.1 meters) over the water.",
      "The storm gates plan would have been one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. This refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers, but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines.",
      "Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy.",
      "\u201cThe overwhelming cost probably had a lot to do with it,\u201d said Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society. \u201cThere's a growing awareness on the part of local officials that the maintenance of these projects falls to them. Maintaining miles of dikes and thousands of feet of gates is very expensive.\u201d",
      "But there are also environmental benefits to eliminating the barriers, Dillingham said, adding they would have interfered with water circulation in the shallow bays, potentially harming fish and wildlife.",
      "The new plan calls for elevating 6,421 homes by installing pilings underneath them. That figure is down from 19,000 in the original plan. Not all details are spelled out, but participants in an elevation plan would have to sign numerous permission forms to have their homes included in the government-funded work.",
      "It envisions flood-proofing 279 critical infrastructure facilities such as police, fire, and ambulance stations and hospitals.",
      "And it calls for using material dredged from the bottom of waterways to restore 217 acres (88 hectares) of salt marshes in seven locations deemed particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. These marshes would act as natural sponges capable of absorbing some of the floodwaters during severe storms.",
      "The latest version of the plan must still be finalized by the Army Corps, and Congress needs to approve funding for the work, which could take 11 years to complete.",

      "The department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights said it investigated nine complaints against University of California schools in Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara, San Diego, Davis and Santa Cruz. The complaints alleged the schools failed to respond effectively to antisemitic and anti-Arab harassment.",
      "The civil rights office concluded the universities \u201cappear not to have responded promptly or effectively\u201d to allegations of discrimination and harassment that were brought to the administrations\u2019 attention.",
      "Under the agreement, the schools must step up reporting of complaints to the OCR office and review all complaints and reports of harassment from the past two academic years to determine if further action is needed. The agreement also calls for more training of university employees and campus police officers about their obligations under federal law.",
      "The University of California system said the agreement is one of several steps it is taking to ensure its campuses are respectful and welcoming to all.",
      "\u201cEnsuring an inclusive University environment requires sustained focus and action,\u201d the system said in a written statement.",
      "Colleges and universities nationwide saw tension and at times violence erupt on campuses after the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, with dueling campus rallies and widespread allegations of antisemitism and anti-Arab harassment.",
      "The Department of Education has been investigating dozens of complaints that campuses violated Title VI, which bars discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color and national origin at colleges and universities that receive federal funding. Examples of harassment can include slurs, taunts, stereotypes, name-calling and racially motivated attacks or hateful conduct, according to the department\u2019s website.",
      "The department reached a similar agreement with Brown University in July.",
      "A separate investigation found the University of Cincinnati did not respond appropriately to reports of harassment, the Office of Civil Rights said Friday. Examples from some two dozen complaints include a Palestinian student who reported receiving death threats, which the university did not investigate, and an anonymous complaint that a Jewish student's home was egged and smeared with feces.",
      "The University of Cincinnati said in a statement it will review its policies and previously filed complaints, and take steps \u201cto practively enhance ongoing efforts to prevent discrimination and harassment.\u201d The university said it investigated the complaint of vandalism at the Jewish student's home, which was made directly to the federal office, but found no reports or evidence of the incident.",
      "UCLA\u2019s handling of dispersing its encampment in the spring drew widespread criticism. Chaos erupted after hundreds of protesters defied orders from campus police to leave the encampment. One night, counter-protesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours before police stepped in.",
      "The investigation into UCLA stemmed partly from concerns of compliance related to about 150 reports the school received about rallies in October and November 2023 as well as a pro-Palestinian encampment in the spring, the department said.",
      "\u201cOf particular concern were reports of violence against students of Jewish ancestry \u2026 and of a violent assault by counter-protesters on pro-Palestinian protesters\u201d at the encampment, the department said.",
      "At rallies, protesters chanted \u201cdeath to Israel\u201d and \u201cno peace until they\u2019re dead,\u201d the department said. At the encampment, protesters maintained checkpoints that excluded Jewish students from the protest area and parts of the campus, prompting the school\u2019s chancellor to issue a statement saying Jewish students on campus, among others, felt \u201ca state of anxiety and fear.\u201d",
      "Muslim and Palestinian students experienced \u201cunwanted filming, doxing, and being followed\u201d on or near the UCLA campus, the department said. A task force report cited by the department said counter-protesters heckled people inside the encampment, saying things like, \u201cyou\u2019re a jihadist,\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re a terrorist.\u201d",
      "The four other UC campuses also had \u201cwidely reported incidents\u201d of alleged harassment against students, the civil rights office said. UC Santa Barbara was notified of antisemitic vandalism at a dorm and signs posted at a student center that targeted Jewish students by name; UC San Diego and UC Davis also received complaints about students experiencing or witnessing antisemitic comments or actions by students and professors.",

      "NORAD's annual tracking of Santa has endured since the Cold War, predating ugly sweater parties and Mariah Carey classics. Here's how it began and why the phones keep ringing.",

      "Realizing an explanation would be lost on the youngster, Shoup summoned a deep, jolly voice and replied, \u201cHo, ho, ho! Yes, I am Santa Claus. Have you been a good boy?\u201d",
      "Shoup said he learned from the boy's mother that Sears mistakenly printed the top-secret number. He hung up, but the phone soon rang again with a young girl reciting her Christmas list. Fifty calls a day followed, he said.",
      "In the pre-digital age, the agency used a 60-by-80-foot (18-by-24-meter) plexiglass map of North America to track unidentified objects. A staff member jokingly drew Santa and his sleigh over the North Pole.",

      "Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming.",
      "There are already a number of similar services on the market - such as Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - which see gamers pay a monthly fee for access to a range of titles rather than owning them outright.",
      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",
      "Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers \"shelling out more money\" on multiple subscription services.",
      "It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans.",
      "Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services.",
      "The amount these services individually charge vary depending on the features and games made available. For example, Xbox Game Pass prices range from \u00a36.99 to \u00a314.99 a month, while PlayStation Plus ranges from \u00a36.99 to \u00a313.49 a month.",
      "So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals.",
      "It could also be attractive for people who mostly want to play Sega games - but for everyone else it could result in higher costs.",
      "Rachel Howie streams herself playing games on Twitch, where she is known as DontRachQuit to her fans, and said she was \"excited and worried\" about another subscription service",
      "\"We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I think that SEGA will definitely have a core dedicated audience that will benefit from this, but will the average gamer choose this over something like Game Pass?\"",
      "And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed.",
      "\"As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,\" she said.",

      "The very first thing Mr Utsumi said to me seemed to suggest that the firm, which dominated gaming in the 1990s with a rivalry between Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Super Mario, may have lost its way.",
      "\"I want to make Sega really shiny again,\" he said.",

      "Tulip Siddiq, 42, who as the Treasury's Economic Secretary is responsible for tackling corruption in UK financial markets, is alleged to have brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will make a key decision which could unlock compensation for millions of motorists.",
    "story": [
      "People mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could wait months for a decision on whether they should receive compensation.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "But the higher Supreme Court has now agreed to hear an appeal against the decision.",
      "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also allowed motor finance providers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "Lawyers acting for motorists say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator has extended the time providers have to consider complaints until December 2025, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "The time period covers claims regarding leasing deals, as well as Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreements.",
      "The FCA also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision when it reconsiders the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, welcomed the extension.",
      "However, others have questioned whether it creates a further compensation delay for those who were mis-sold these agreements."

    "summary": "Inflation has hit its highest level for eight months, will prices continue to rise at a faster rate?",
    "story": [
      "The UK inflation rate has gone up for the second month in a row, with prices rising at their fastest pace since March. What does it mean for you?",
      "What has happened to inflation?",
      "The main measure of inflation - looking at how much prices had risen over the previous 12 months - went up to 2.6%.",
      "That is a lot lower than its peak during the cost of living crisis. In 2022, inflation soared to 11.2% because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Inflation had fallen to 1.7% in September this year - its lowest level for over three years - but now it's rising again.",

      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What has gone up in price?",
      "The Office for National Statistics, which calculates the inflation rate, highlighted the rising cost of petrol and diesel as one of the key reasons behind the latest inflation rise.",
      "Tobacco products went up after the chancellor raised taxes on them in the Budget. Clothing, footwear and electronic games also cost more.",
      "But in general the price of services, such as theatre and concert tickets, education and health, rose faster than goods.",
      "The cost of housing, including rent, which is calculated under a different headline figure, also rose sharply in the year to November - up by 7.8%.",
      "But air travel saw its biggest November price fall since the start of the century.",
      "Will prices keep rising?",
      "Prices are almost always rising a bit; around 2% a year is considered a healthy rate of inflation.",
      "Much lower than that risks people delaying purchases because they may get cheaper. A little inflation encourages you to buy sooner - and that boosts economic growth.",
      "But the Bank of England currently predicts that inflation will edge up to 2.75% in the second half of next year before falling again.",
      "The government's official forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility, expects a similar increase. It has said policies announced in the recent Budget - including firms passing on higher costs from rises in employer national insurance and the minimum wage - would help drive inflation higher.",
      "Could there be another cost of living crisis?",
      "No-one is currently forecasting another big burst of inflation, but predicting the future path of prices is difficult, given all the factors that could influence them, from incoming US President Donald Trump's policies on trade to the mood of shoppers on the High Street.",
      "On average, wages are now rising faster than prices, which helps to relieve the pressure, but of course prices for most things remain significantly higher than they were a few years ago.",
      "Housing costs, whether rents or mortgages, especially are a major source of financial pressure for a lot of people.",
      "Even if the rate of inflation does come down next year, that does not mean prices will fall. They will just rise more slowly, leaving most things more expensive than they were before.",
      "What does it mean for interest rates?",
      "On Thursday, the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee will meet to discuss whether to cut rates.",
      "They are not expected to bring rates down from their current 4.75%.",
      "That is because higher interest rates help keep inflation in check by dampening down borrowing and spending. If borrowing gets cheaper, people are likely to have more money to spend which could mean prices rise faster.",
      "So the higher inflation figure, added to the news earlier in the week that wages are growing faster than before, will have given the Bank more reason to wait.",
      "Investors are factoring in rate cuts for next year, but expect them to come more slowly than was forecast a few months ago.",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",

      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",
      "Dr Heller says this may be \"three to five years\" away.",
      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",

      "As the ink was drying on one of the world's biggest trade deals, signed in Uruguay this month, and hailed as a milestone for the global economy, anger was brewing thousands of miles away in France.",
      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",

Farmers in the Mercosur countries [the name of the Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay block] have less restrictions regarding pesticides and lower labour costs.\"",
      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",
      "They lit up red flares, and chanted slogans like \"We are feeding you, show us some respect\".",

      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",

      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:58:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC speaks with parents who insist the school system is \"broken\" as latest government estimates point to a rise in home education.",
    "story": [
      "\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in.",
      "\"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\"",
      "Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped.",
      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",
      "Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative\u2026 the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\"",
      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",

      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",

      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",

      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",

      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",

      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",

      "And when pubs were shut, many people started buying alcohol in shops and drinking at home.",

    "story": [
      "The mother of a young girl operated on by a disgraced surgeon at a famous London children's hospital said she should never have been left in his care.",
      "Jodee Seeley told BBC Newsnight she was considering legal action after Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh), whom she accuses of \"gaslighting\" her, allowed Yaser Jabbar to operate on her daughter Alana even when complaints had been raised about his misconduct.",
      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a Royal College of Surgeons inquiry found he had performed \"incorrect\" or \"inappropriate\" surgery in several cases.",
      "A spokesperson for Gosh said it understood \"why Alana and her family are worried\"  and apologised that \"they feel information was withheld from them\".",
      "Mr Jabbar had operated on Jodee's daughter in 2022, when she was eight years old, fitting metal plates into her knees for leg lengthening and straightening.",
      "He was a leading surgeon at the renowned hospital, operating on children with complicated disorders and carrying out procedures, such as the one undergone by Alana, who has a complex chromosome abnormality.",
      "The hospital has since initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients to conclude what level of harm they had experienced.",
      "Some cases linked to Mr Jabbar resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Jodee, from Essex, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that she had no idea of the doctor's reputation when her daughter Alana was referred to his care in 2021.",
      "At that point, concerns had already been raised about Mr Jabbar.",
      "She said that at the family's first consultation in March 2021, which lasted \"about five minutes\", Mr Jabbar had advised the invasive surgery.",
      "\"We didn't want to rock the boat too much because he seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing,\" she said.",
      "\"So we kind of went along with it thinking he's an orthopaedic surgeon, it's Great Ormond Street [Hospital]. We trusted him.\"",
      "She said she was told the surgery would improve Alana's mobility and put her \"knee into place... and then from there we could assess whether anything else needed to be done\".",
      "The operation took place 10 months later, in January 2022. During that period, more professional complaints from other surgeons were raised with the managers at the hospital.",
      "None of this was ever disclosed to Jodee or other families of Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "She said the surgery had appeared to go well and, with Alana's leg bandaged up, there had not seemed to be any immediate problems.",
      "But when the bandage came off a few weeks later, Jodee saw two scars instead of one on the inside of her child's leg when they had been told it would be just one incision.",
      "\"The alarm bells rang at that point,\" she said.",
      "As weeks went by, the mobility of Alana, now aged 11, was not improving and she was reporting pain frequently, often needing painkillers.",
      "Jodee said she had thought at first: \"Well, maybe it just hasn't worked? Maybe that wasn't the right procedure and it will be removed? Or maybe it's just too early to tell?\"",
      "She said she had expected regular check-ups from the hospital but a follow-up appointment did not come until July - six months after the operation.",
      "The plates in Alana's knees were supposed to be there for about two years and Jodee says another surgeon at the hospital recommended keeping the plates in place at the follow-up appointment.",
      "Then, by chance, they saw Mr Jabbar on the same visit.",
      "Jodee said he took one look and said they \"needed to come out immediately\" and asked the family to return the following day for another major operation.",
      "He told the family he was worried Alana's tendons could re-fuse to the metal plates, Jodee said.",
      "\"We were really panicked, we were really worried.... [thinking] 'What have we done, is she okay, is it long-term damage?'\"",
      "They returned to the hospital in August 2022 to have the plates removed.",
      "But the family's concern was now so strong that they moved Alana to a different hospital months after.",
      "Jodee said her daughter's mobility was now \"worse\" and that she was \"still having falls\".",
      "Jodee said she was not informed of anything wrong with Mr Jabbar's work until February this year, more than 16 months on.",
      "She said the hospital informed her only in a brief letter with few details.",
      "\"It seemed like quite a general letter... nothing to worry about,\" she said.",
      "She did not realise the extent of Mr Jabbar's reported misconduct until media reports.",
      "\"I did not realise the scale of it or what actually happened or that there had been so many complaints,\" she added.",
      "\"I just felt sick, to be honest,\" she said. \"So obviously devastated. As a parent, obviously you want to protect your child, it is the number one priority. And I knew something was amiss when we had seen him.\"",
      "Jodee said her daughter should never have been put under the surgeon's care and has accused the hospital of a culture of complicity.",
      "She told the BBC she had heard from the hospital immediately prior to talking to reporters.",
      "She said this could be a coincidence or \"they've been pushed to do that because they were aware that I'd be coming to talk to you today\".",
      "\"It does actually feel like they've been gaslighting the whole way,\" she added.",
      "Jodee said she and her family were very private but she had felt compelled to speak out so other victims could know they are \"not alone\".",
      "\"It's really important for other people to know what's happened and to understand if they're being gaslighted as well, that they're not alone, that this is what's going on,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for the hospital said it was sorry to all concerned families, adding that after the Royal College of Surgeons report, it had asked external experts to review all Mr Jabbar's patients.",
      "The statement goes on: \"They are working at pace [...]  We understand why Alana and her family are worried [...] and we have reached out to them.",
      "\"We are sorry they feel that information was withheld from them. Once concerns were raised about the surgeon's practice in June 2022, we shared these with the General Medical Council and undertook rapid fact-finding. During this period the surgeon's practice was restricted to simple procedures [...] and always as part of a wider surgical team.",
      "\"We then had to establish the facts before sharing information with patients.",
      "\"We are now updating patients regularly about the progress of the review.",
      "\"We are aware there were concerns regarding specific patients in 2021 that were raised as formal incidents and were fully investigated. The findings in each individual case and collectively did not trigger the threshold for initiating further action at that time.\"",
      "Great Ormond Street's actions in the wake of Mr Jabbar's departure have continued to come under fire.",
      "This year the hospital has initiated independent reports into each of his 723 patients, to conclude what level of harm they experienced.",
      "But families who have received the results in recent weeks have called the reviews a mis-representation and a \"whitewash\" of what their children experienced.",
      "Parents have told the BBC how the hospital \"failed their children\", leaving them physically and mentally damaged.",
      "The BBC has spoken to at least four families - and had indirect contact with 12 more - who say the reports do not reflect their children's experiences or minimise their pain and suffering.",
      "The reviews, carried out by specialist surgeons who did not work at GOSH, were based on patient notes provided by the hospital.",
      "Many of the reports were also made without any interviews with the patient or their family.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:27:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The psychological condition stops players from releasing a dart.",
    "story": [
      "Former professional darts champion Kevin Painter has thrown arrows almost every day for 40 years.",
      "Throughout his career he thrived under pressure, playing in the most prestigious competitions and taking home more than \u00a3900,000 in prize money.",
      "But earlier this year, he went to throw a dart and it physically would not leave his hand.",
      "\"You're in shock, I stood there for ages. I just couldn't get my arm up to let go of the dart,\" he said.",
      "Kevin was suffering from dartitis, a mental condition where the brain stops a player from being able to release a dart.",
      "Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge.",
      "\"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University.",
      "From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis.",
      "\"I used to combat it with extra practice. It was heard of back in the day, but not many people spoke about it,\" she said.",
      "Dartitis can affect all players, professional or amateur.",
      "Jack Langston, a darts referee and online content creator, was 12 when he first experienced the condition.",
      "\"There was a little pause just before I threw the dart,\" he said.",
      "It was barely noticeable at first but eventually it became so bad he would take 60 seconds to throw three darts.",
      "By the age of 13, he was forced to quit and at the time, considered his darts career to be over.",
      "\"You're turning up and getting beat by people you know you should be beating,\" he said.",
      "\"It's so demoralising. It's a real mental struggle.\"",
      "Every case is different, and there is no one single cause, but lots of players report it comes from a fear of missing.",
      "\"It's brought on by anxiety and stress,\" Kevin said.",
      "\"Where others have panic attacks, for me it manifested as dartitis.\"",
      "Dr Duffy says that - perhaps due to its name - players have a tendency to view dartitis as a problem unique to the sport which therefore demands unique solutions.",
      "\"It's just another cognitive disorder, so it should be treated that way,\" she says. \"The underlying mechanisms that cause dartitis are the same things that cause any other anxiety disorder.\"",
      "She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",
      "During his sessions, the patient lies on a sofa and is guided into a trance where they are then \"hit with all the confidence work and the motivation work\", Mr O'Connor said.",
      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.",
      "The therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said.",
      "Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions.",
      "\"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\"",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",
      "But it worked, and within three months he was winning matches at amateur tournaments.",
      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "In another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

      "Separate figures from the ONS showed retail sales rose slightly last month, helped by stronger trading at supermarkets.",
      "The latest figures come as economic growth in the UK remains weak and inflation -  the rate at which prices increase over time - is rising at its fastest pace since March.",
      "November's borrowing figure was down by \u00a33.4bn from the same month last year and below expectations of around \u00a313bn.",

      "Debt interest was down \u00a34.7bn from a year earlier to \u00a33bn, mainly due to lower inflation.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said November borrowing \"undershooting\" expectations meant \"Christmas has come early\" for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",

      "However, its latest survey period did not cover the official Black Friday date of 29 November.",
      "The latest economic figures come after the Bank of England voted to hold interest rates on Thursday, stating it thought the UK economy had performed worse than expected, with no growth at all between October and December.",
      "The Bank downgraded its growth forecast from 0.3% for the final three months of 2024, to zero growth.",
      "The growth revisions were seen as a blow to Labour, which has made growing the economy its top priority.",
      "Other figures released this week showed inflation hit 2.6% in the year to November, above the Bank's 2% target.",
      "Responding to the latest borrowing figures, Darren Jones, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the government had \"inherited crumbling public services and crippled public finances\" when it entered power.",

      "Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, said retailers had \"seen quite soft demand\" due to low consumer confidence, hitting clothes shops."

      "\"The United States is one of our most important allies and as we move into a new chapter in our friendship,\" he said.",
      "\"Peter will bring unrivalled experience to the role and take our partnership from strength to strength.\"",
      "Like other senior Labour figures, Lord Mandelson has a record of criticising Donald Trump, once describing him as \"little short of a white nationalist and racist\".",
      "In a recently unearthed interview with an Italian journalist in 2019, Lord Mandelson described Trump as a \"reckless and a danger to the world\".",
      "In a 2018 interview with the Evening Standard, he also called Trump \"a bully\".",
      "Since being touted as a potential candidate for the US-ambassador role, considered the most prestigious diplomatic post in the UK government, Lord Mandelson has softened his language on Trump.",

      "As a staunch critic of Brexit and advocate for global free-trade, he does not appear to be an obvious fit with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The former cabinet minister and EU trade negotiator also has enormous political experience, and Downing Street may have judged that sending someone so close to the big political figures in the UK may go down well at the White House.",
      "Trump had once called Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage a \"great choice\" for ambassador - but Labour were unlikely to choose a political opponent such as Farage.",
      "Lord Mandelson has suggested making use of Farage's connections in the US as a \"bridgehead, both to President Trump and to Elon Musk and others\".",
      "\"You've got to be pragmatic, practical about this,\" he said.",
      "Farage has meanwhile said that he \"might disagree with Mandelson on his politics, but he's a very intelligent man\" and would be good choice for ambassador.",

He stood down as an MP in 2004 to become a European Commissioner before returning to the UK to become Gordon Brown's most senior minister.",

    "story": [
      "A man has admitted threatening to kill his MP after saying he wanted to lock him in a building and set fire to it.",
      "Benjamin Clarke, 31, of Bishop Auckland, County Durham, appeared at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court.",
      "He pleaded guilty to making threats to kill MP Sam Rushworth, and a malicious communications offence.",
      "Clarke, of Durham Street, was granted bail with the condition he must not contact the Labour MP ahead of his sentencing on 16 January at Durham Crown Court.",
      "Sara Kemp, prosecuting, said Clarke contacted the MP in August on social media, saying: \"I cannot wait for your next public appearance, you will be lucky to leave it in one piece.\"",
      "Rushworth then blocked him, preventing any further malicious communications offences, Ms Kemp said.",
      "'A matter of time'",
      "The following month, Clarke told two mental health practitioners he wanted to find the MP and smash his head off a pavement, to set fire to a building he was in and then \"lock all the doors so I could hear him screaming\".",
      "Clarke added: \"I'm going to do it, it's just a matter of time.\"",
      "Ms Kemp said the MP had made a victim statement and was particularly concerned for the safety of his family.",
      "Amrit Jandoo, defending, said Clarke had no political views or malice towards Rushworth, \"but it is quite clear he has taken umbrage against the MP\".",
      "He asked for a pre-sentence report to be made before Clarke's crown court appearance.",
      "Mr Jandoo said his client had a history of mental health treatment.",
      "He added: \"He would fully accept that his behaviour on these occasions has been very poor.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK government has insisted Mauritius is ready to finalise a deal over the future of the Chagos Islands, despite the country's new PM demanding better terms.",
      "Under the agreement announced in October, the UK would hand sovereignty over the islands to Mauritius, but maintain a 99-year lease over the UK-US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told MPs that it was a \"monumental failure of statecraft\", while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said there was \"very deep disquiet\" about it among US President-elect Donald Trump's incoming team.",
      "Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty argued the deal was in all sides' interests.",
      "On Tuesday, Mauritius said it had put forward changes to the original deal, which was struck shortly before then-Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth suffered a landslide defeat in a general election.",
      "His successor Navin Ramgoolam told the Mauritian parliament he was \"still willing to conclude an agreement\", but the draft deal was not good enough for his country.",
      "He did not spell out what changes he was seeking.",
      "In the Commons, Conservative Dame Priti accused the Labour government of putting the UK's national security at risk, ignoring the interests of Chagossians, and \"letting our standing go into freefall\" in an increasingly dangerous world.",
      "\"If the deal is so good, why has the government been so secretive about the details?\" she asked.",

      "\"How much is the British taxpayer going to be liable for each year, and in total, over 99 years?\" she also asked.",
      "Doughty insisted the deal would enhance, not damage UK security, saying it would protect the military base's operation and ensure it was \"on a safe footing well into the next century\".",
      "He said the UK would be able to extend its lease beyond 99 years, that Britain and its allies would continue to have operational autonomy, and that \"safeguards\" were in place to prevent other countries' forces operating on the archipelago's outer islands.",
      "He said it was \"not normal practice\" to comment on the costs of military bases.",
      "Doughty told MPs it was \"completely understandable\" that the new Mauritian government wanted time to study the details of the agreement, adding he was confident \"we have agreed a good and fair deal that is in both sides' interests\".",
      "\"It protects the base at proportionate cost. It has been supported across the national security architecture in the United States and by India,\" he said.",
      "However, having just returned from visiting Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort for talks with Elon Musk and other allies of the president-elect, Farage challenged that.",
      "\"There is very deep disquiet amongst all of them as to what this may mean for the long-term future of Diego Garcia and whether such deal would hold, given the precedent of the deal break over Hong Kong,\" he told MPs.",
      "The Reform UK leader also suggested the terms of the deal should be put to a referendum of exiled Chagossians.",
      "Last month, Farage predicted that the deal would be met with \"outright hostility\" by the Trump administration, which takes office on 20 January.",
      "He suggested Trump's advisers were worried it could boost China's influence in the region.",
      "But, on Wednesday, Doughty said Farage did not know the details of the agreement, which US officials had also considered.",
      "No 10 said it was not aware of any contact with the incoming Trump administration about the Chagos Islands deal.",
      "\"The focus of our discussions at the moment are obviously with the new Mauritian government,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced increasing diplomatic isolation over the islands, with various United Nations bodies - including the International Court of Justice and the General Assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius's claim to sovereignty.",
      "Mauritius has long argued it was illegally forced to give the islands away in return for its independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it Diego Garcia for use as a military base.",
      "The UK later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes."

    "story": [
      "The government has announced an extra \u00a3700m for English council budgets next year as a \"first step\" to rebuild their finances.",

      "English councils say funding boost won't be enough",
      "Rayner promises mayor for every region of England",
      "The provisional figures cover spending from April next year, and will be subject to consultation and potential further revision in February.",
      "The extra funding for next year includes \u00a3600m that will be allocated to councils according to their level of deprivation, with a separate grant to help rural councils deliver services \"repurposed\".",
      "Ministers argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally, but it has prompted a backlash from the County Councils Network, which represents large county authorities.",
      "The CCN said rural areas were set to lose out, and argued that deprivation is not a \"key indicator of which councils are under the most financial distress\".",
      "This argument is set to grow louder next year, when the government consults on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026 as part of a wider shake-up of council financing.",
      "Ministers say the new formula will take into account the \"impact of rurality\" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Tory councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being short-changed.",
      "Monthly bills",
      "Other future changes include a move towards multi-year funding settlements, a Labour manifesto promise, with the government promising budgets will cover a minimum of two years.",
      "Council tax bills will also move towards monthly payment by default, instead of spreading payments over 10 months as now, with taxes for social care displayed separately and more information on how taxes are spent.",
      "Next year's settlement includes an extra \u00a3200m to help councils with responsibility for adult social care to provide subsidies for care costs, taking total funding in this area to \u00a33.7bn next year.",
      "Although the cash boost is likely to be welcomed by the sector, providers have expressed concern about the impact of rising National Insurance (NI) costs.",
      "Tax rises",
      "Charitable and private sector providers are ineligible for a funding pot reserved to compensate public sector bodies, although the prime minister's spokesman said a plan to alleviate the rise for hospices would be announced before Christmas.",
      "Although councils will share \u00a3515m to offset NI rises for their employees, the CCN argued the sum would not be enough to offset indirect costs from council services delivered by private providers.",
      "The LGA has also argued extra costs for contractors will mean some council services will become more expensive to deliver.",
      "Shadow local government minister David Simmonds said the government's funding boost was \"beautifully packaged\" but councils would find the \"box is somewhat emptier than people were expecting\" given funding pressures.",
      "He added that councils also faced uncertainty over the costs of funding local elections next year, after the government confirmed plans this week to merge councils as part of a major shake-up of the council map."

      "Tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payments before the end of the year as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been grappling with a growing backlog of new claims for Pension Credit, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.",
      "There has been a surge in applications for Pension Credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that Winter Fuel Payments for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving Pension Credit.",
      "There was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims as of mid-November with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures.",
      "With a likely similar amount of new applications each week since then, there is a  risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of the year.",
      "The DWP said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing.",
      "Gary Jameson in Oxford applied for Pension Credit in early September, well in advance of his 66th birthday, so he wouldn't lose out when his disability benefits stopped. But his birthday has been and gone and he has still not had a decision.",
      "\"I'm having to transfer money from my own private savings, which are not very much anyway,\" he told BBC Verify.",
      "He was originally told it would take six to 10 weeks to process his claim, \"but I think with all the delays it will probably be months,\" he added.",

      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Pensioners encouraged to claim",
      "On 18 December, MPs are launching an inquiry into how changes to the Winter Fuel Payment are affecting pensioner poverty.",
      "Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.",
      "Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim.",
      "The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November.",
      "However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075.",
      "Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved.",
      "BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision.",
      "And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March.",
      "After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.",
      "'Manage through Christmas'",
      "DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July.",
      "That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their \u00a3200 to \u00a3300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025.",
      "The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"",
      "\"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\"",
      "The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment.",
      "The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog.",
      "More claims processed",

    "summary": "From fears of an election wipeout to bouncing back with the budget, John Swinney reflects on a chaotic 2024.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",
      "What has happened to UK interest rates?",
      "The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and again to 4.75% in November.",
      "As expected, it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October.",
      "In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it could be a \"bit more aggressive\" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control.",
      "However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - including an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers - would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices.",
      "Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey said the path for rates would likely be \"downward from here\" but warned cuts would be gradual.",
      "After the December meeting, he said \"a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right\", but added \"with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year.\"",
      "The next interest rate decision will be on Thursday 6 February.",

    "summary": "What difference could the biggest shake up of local government in 50 years make to your area?",
    "story": [
      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",
      "The government says it wants to replace this right to bid with a right to buy, with funding available to purchase community assets.",
      "Local communities and businesses will also be given powers to rent shops that have been vacant for a long time, helping to revitalise high streets."

      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",

    "summary": "Planned legal changes will see three neonicotinoid pesticides completely banned from any future use.",
    "story": [
      "Emergency use of three pesticides that can be deadly to bees will soon be stopped for good, the government has said.",
      "Neonicotinoids were banned in 2018 but sugar beet farmers have been given special permission to use them every year for the past four years to fight virus yellows, a disease spread by aphids.",
      "The government announced on Saturday that it would be looking at \"legislative options\" that would legally prevent all future use of three specific neonicotinoids.",
      "In the meantime, an application for emergency use in 2025 by the National Farmers' Union (NFU) and British Sugar will still have to be considered under existing laws.",
      "The two organisations said industry work on developing alternative ways of fighting the disease \u2013 which has caused crop losses of up to 80% in the past \u2013 was \"progressing well\".",
      "The NFU added that simply having a list of banned products for which there could be no emergency authorisation for use \"could set a worrying precedent\" but wildlife organisations have welcomed the government's announcement.",
      "Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said there was \"no place in British agriculture for toxic bee-killing pesticides\".",
      "He added that the government's decision \"must not be undermined by granting the emergency use of neonicotinoids next year\".",
      "Jenna Hegarty, head of policy at the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the decision was \"long overdue\".",
      "The current application for emergency use authorisation is for Cruiser SB, a neonicotinoid used as a seed treatment.",
      "Although the application process will still go ahead under the law as it stands, the government said it would be reviewing guidance to ensure \"full account\" is taken of the risks to pollinators in any decision made by the Secretary of State.",
      "Studies have shown that neonicotinoids can be extremely toxic to pollinators and, even at doses that are not directly fatal to bees, they can cause cognitive problems that impact bees' foraging abilities and the productivity of hives.",
      "Banning emergency authorisations was a key election pledge of Labour and the government said on Saturday that it would be consulting on the plan and identifying the potential changes to legislation needed.",
      "'Important step'",
      "A future complete ban would cover neonicotinoid products containing clothianidin, imidacloprid or thiamethoxam.",
      "Environment minister Emma Hardy said stopping their use was \"an important step in supporting the long-term health of our environment and waterways, and our farming sector\".",
      "In a joint statement, Michael Sly, the chairman of the NFU's sugar board, and Dan Green, agriculture director for British Sugar \u2013 which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - said there was still an \"ongoing risk\" from virus yellows.",
      "But they said the pesticide would only be used on seeds if a certain threshold of threat \u2013 set by government \u2013 was met and any use would be strictly managed.",
      "They added that the industry was dedicated to finding \"sustainable solutions\" to tackling crop disease.",
      "\"We have seen developments across several areas, including in gene editing, conventional breeding techniques and several novel integrated pest management trials which are showing promise,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Walkers and history-lovers have no easy way to visit more than a quarter of England's most ancient countryside landmarks because they are on private land with no legal rights of access, according to research by campaigners.",
      "A report by the Right to Roam group has found that more than 5,500 lesser-known sites designated as Scheduled Monuments have no direct footpaths to them or are not on open access land.",
      "The Stone Club, a group for neolithic stone enthusiasts, said its members often had to trespass to access sites.",
      "Government advisors Historic England said landowners were not obliged to open such sites to the public, although many do give permission on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Scheduled monument sites identified by Right to Roam campaigners as having no existing legal rights of way to them include hillforts, holy wells, henges and ancient burial mounds known as barrows.",
      "Scheduled monuments are nationally important archaeological sites, both above and below ground, that have been selected by the government for legal protection in a similar way to 'listed' buildings.",
      "This list of 19,966  is kept and maintained by Historic England.",
      "It includes monuments and sites that can be accessed, ranging from the ancient Avebury henge and stone circles in Wiltshire and the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk to the world's first purpose-built motor racing circuit in Surrey.",
      "But among the 5,500 sites identified by Right to Roam as having no basic legal right of direct public access are the East Kennett long barrow in Wiltshire, a neolithic burial mound first protected as a scheduled monument in 1924, and the Holne Chase Iron Age hill fort in woodland on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon.",
      "While scheduling means a private landowner needs consent to carry out any works to a protected site, it does not affect their ownership nor give the general public any new rights of access beyond existing footpaths.",
      "However, the owners of the East Kennett site told the BBC that they were happy for people to visit with permission, as safety was an issue when horse training took place nearby.",
      "The owner of the Holne Chase site has been approached by the BBC for comment.",
      "The countryside charity CPRE, formerly known as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said it believed Right to Roam's estimate of sites without a legal right of access was \"likely a significant underestimate\".",
      "That, it said, was because the report excluded sites that may not have direct access but were within 20m of a road or footpath and could therefore be viewed from a distance, such as the Devil's Arrows stone circle in North Yorkshire.",
      "CPRE president Mary-Ann Ochota said the public should have a legal right of \"responsible access\" to ancient landmarks as \"peering over a fence isn't enough\".",
      "Meanwhile, the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents rural landowners, said many of the sites identified \"face constant threats - from motorbikes to metal detectors - and are too fragile to survive unchecked access\".",
      "\"Open them up, and we could lose them forever,\" its president, Victoria Vyvyan, explained.",
      "She called for more funding for farmers to provide \"controlled, guided\" access and to better protect scheduled monuments on their land.",

      "Right to Roam campaigner Amy-Jane Beer said ancient sites needed to be accessible as they \"connect us with our past and enrich our experience of the countryside\".",
      "The group is calling for a change in the law to bring England in line with Scotland where, since 2003, there has existed a right of responsible access to most land.",
      "Matthew Shaw, of the Stone Club, added: \"Sites which are visited often have active groups caring for them - maintaining access, ensuring the stones are well looked after and liaising with the landowner.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the purpose of scheduling monuments was to preserve them for future generations and does not create new rights of public access.",
      "A Historic England spokesman added that it did not require landowners to open their sites to the public.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 00:36:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change makes it trickier for Churchill's residents to co-exist with increasingly hungry predators",
    "story": [
      "\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada.",
      "\"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose.",
      "\"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\"",
      "Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life.",
      "Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\"",
      "Running away from a charging polar bear is \u2013 perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph).",
      "Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night.",
      "Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.",
      "\"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alysa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first.",
      "\"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\"",
      "There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied.",
      "\"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alysa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\"",
      "The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform.",
      "\"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alysa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\"",
      "While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year.",
      "We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres.",
      "After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy.",
      "The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly.",
      "\"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades.",
      "Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.",
      "The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill.",
      "\"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\"",
      "Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.",
      "Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact.",
      "Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day.",
      "We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\"",
      "For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside.",
      "\"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk.",
      "They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter \u2013 and released further along the bay, away from people.",
      "Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983.",
      "\"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\"",
      "People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\"",
      "The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since.",
      "Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change.",
      "Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay.",
      "\"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang.",
      "One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill.",
      "Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water.",
      "For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world.",
      "\"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\"",
      "Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\"",
      "\"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\"",
      "While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears.",
      "Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town.",
      "\"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\"",
      "The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.",

    "story": [
      "The government and regulators have broken the law by being too lenient on water companies that spill sewage, the UK's environment watchdog has found.",
      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",

      "\"The OEP's findings offer yet another devastating verdict of the total failure of environmental regulation in our country,\" said chair and founder of River Action Charles Watson. \"It is nothing short of scandalous.\"",
      "Sewage sometimes needs to be released when it is raining to prevent a build-up of wastewater in the system and sewage flowing back into people's homes.",
      "But two years ago the wildlife charity WildFish complained to the OEP that the Conservative government, and the regulators - Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) - were allowing excessive releases. It argued that according to the law sewage should only be released under \"exceptional circumstances\", such as unusually heavy rain, rather than any wet weather.",
      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 03:20:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change could increase flood threats without improvements to defences, the Environment Agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",
      "Earlier this year, a cross-party committee of MPs warned that the government had not maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones. A lack of funding has been a key issue.",

    "story": [
      "Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research.",
      "In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023.",
      "The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023.",
      "Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\".",
      "Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army.",
      "Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Wattan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world.",
      "BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since.",
      "Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares.",
      "During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.",
      "Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts.",
      "\"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel.",
      "Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it.",
      "To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%.",
      "Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly.",
      "An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous.",
      "For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\".",
      "To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera.",
      "However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%.",
      "Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023.",
      "It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies.",
      "The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted.",
      "\"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Leaked Instagram documents",
      "The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users.",
      "One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts.",
      "\"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said.",
      "Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\".",
      "Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories.",
      "It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened.",
      "At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers.",
      "\"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza.",

      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",

      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",
      "Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers \"shelling out more money\" on multiple subscription services.",
      "It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans.",
      "Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services.",
      "The amount these services individually charge vary depending on the features and games made available. For example, Xbox Game Pass prices range from \u00a36.99 to \u00a314.99 a month, while PlayStation Plus ranges from \u00a36.99 to \u00a313.49 a month.",
      "So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals.",
      "It could also be attractive for people who mostly want to play Sega games - but for everyone else it could result in higher costs.",
      "Rachel Howie streams herself playing games on Twitch, where she is known as DontRachQuit to her fans, and said she was \"excited and worried\" about another subscription service",
      "\"We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I think that SEGA will definitely have a core dedicated audience that will benefit from this, but will the average gamer choose this over something like Game Pass?\"",
      "And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed.",
      "\"As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,\" she said.",
      "But she wondered if Sega did create a rival subscription service if this would lead to their games being removed from other services.",
      "\"If so, it could mean that consumers are shelling out more money across owning multiple subscription services,\" she said.",

      "Shuji Utsumi spoke to the BBC ahead of the premiere of the film Sonic 3 on Saturday, after a year in which he oversaw the launch of Metaphor: ReFantazio, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and the latest Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "Our conversation started in an unexpected way.",
      "The very first thing Mr Utsumi said to me seemed to suggest that the firm, which dominated gaming in the 1990s with a rivalry between Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Super Mario, may have lost its way.",
      "\"I want to make Sega really shiny again,\" he said.",
      "He said Sega had been putting too much focus on domestic success in Japan, and needed to re-establish itself on a global stage, which would mean expanding past its base.",
      "\"Sega has been somehow losing confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"But why? Sega has a great RPG group, Sega has amazing IPs, Sega is a really well-known brand.",
      "\"So I was like, hey, now is not the time to be defensive - but more offensive.\"",
      "He said the company was too concerned about controlling costs when he took over, and he wants to \"bring a rock and roll mentality\" to gaming.",
      "When I told him that sounded familiar - Sega's marketing in the 90s often tried to position Sonic the Hedgehog as the cool alternative to Mario - he agreed.",
      "He said the firm now simply must \"make a great game\" in the series.",
      "\"The next one is going to be a quite challenging, quite exciting game that we are working on,\" he said.",
      "But he would not divulge whether Sega was considering a follow up to the much-loved Sonic Adventure series.",
      "\"Sonic Adventure was kind of a game-changer for Sonic,\" he said.",
      "\"When we release it, it should be good, it should be impressive - we need to meet or even exceed people's expectations, so it takes some time.\"",
      "Part of the series which fans have been clamouring to see return is the Chao Garden - a much-loved virtual pet synonymous with Sonic Adventure.",
      "Mr Utsumi said \"we've been talking about it\" - but would not go into further detail, only that he could not \"say too much about it\".",
      "Sega's future",
      "Mr Utsumi unsurprisingly talked up the firm's successes this year, which have included winning multiple gaming awards with new IP Metaphor: ReFantazio, made by the team behind the Persona series.",
      "But it hasn't all been positive for the firm, with job cuts in March, and Football Manager 2025 being delayed to next year.",
      "\"It was a hard decision,\" he said of the cuts which saw 240 people lose their jobs.",
      "\"But when you reset the initiative, you have to make that hard decision.\"",
      "And he said Football Manager had been delayed over \"a quality issue\".",
      "\"I mean, financially, maybe providing the game at an early stage can be the better choice.",
      "\"But we decided to keep having the quality level - to keep that discipline.\"",
      "And he also spoke of how Sega's year has gone outside of gaming, with several film and television adaptations being capped off with the third Sonic the Hedgehog movie releasing on Saturday.",
      "\"I just saw the movie - it's so much fun. It'd be nice if that kind of excitement goes on.\"",

      "Also on trial are a Muslim activist who led an online campaign against Paty, two boyhood friends of Chechen-born killer Abdoullakh Anzorov who allegedly helped him acquire weapons, and four radicalised men with whom he exchanged messages on social media.",
      "Anzorov was shot dead by police minutes after killing the 47 year-old history-geography teacher outside his secondary school in the Paris suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine.",
      "He was fired up by claims circulating on the internet that a few days earlier Paty had ordered Muslims to leave his class of 13-year-olds before revealing obscene pictures of the prophet Muhammad.",

      "The trial has centred on legal arguments over whether people who in advance had no knowledge of the attack \u2013 or in some cases even of its perpetrator \u2013 could by their words nonetheless be guilty of \"terrorist association\".",
      "Summing up in court this week, prosecution lawyers asked for jail terms of between 18 months suspended and 16 years for the accused, saying their actions had indirectly led to the atrocity.",

      "\"No-one is saying they wanted the death of Samuel Paty, but in lighting 1,000 digital fuses they knew that one of them would lead to jihadist violence against the teacher,\" according to prosecution's submission.",
      "The context in October 2020 was one of heightened tensions over jihadist violence, after Charlie Hebdo republished some of the controversial Muhammad cartoons.   Five years earlier most of the staff of the magazine had been murdered in a jihadist gun attack at their Paris office.",
      "This week in court the longest jail terms were requested for the two friends of Anzorov who accompanied him when he bought a knife and a fake gun. One of them also drove Anzorov to the school on the afternoon of the attack.",
      "Neither of these defendants is a radicalised Muslim, and it was not established in court that they knew of Anzorov's plans.",
      "That was why the prosecution downgraded the charge against them from \"complicity in a terrorist attack\" which carries a possible life sentence.",
      "The four other accused are people with whom Anzorov conversed on chatlines, again without him ever revealing his intention to kill Paty.",
      "One of these, a convert to Islam called Priscilla Mangel, admitted making \"provocative\" remarks online about the Paty case but said she would never have made them had she known Anzorov's intentions.",

    "story": [
      "Poland has accused Hungary of acting in a hostile manner by granting political asylum to a former Polish deputy justice minister accused of defrauding the state.",
      "Marcin Romanowski, 48, is facing 11 charges in Poland, including defrauding or attempting to defraud $40m (\u00a332m; \u20ac39m) from a justice fund meant to help victims of crime when he served as deputy justice minister under the previous Law and Justice-led government between 2019 and 2023.",
      "\"We consider the decision of Viktor Orban's government to grant political asylum to M.Romanowski, a suspect in criminal offences and wanted under a European Arrest Warrant, to be an act hostile to the Republic of Poland and the principles of the European Union,\" Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X on Thursday night.",
      "\"Tomorrow we will announce our decisions.\"",
      "On Friday, the foreign ministry said it was summoning Hungary's ambassador to the country and would request the European Commission to launch proceedings against Budapest if it fails to fulfil its EU obligations.",
      "Mr Romanowski was responsible for the justice fund under the previous government that lost power in 2023's election.",
      "An audit found that only 40% of the funds' resources went to crime victims and former prisoner rehabilitation, and that contracts were issued at the minister's discretion without due competitive process.",
      "Mr Romanowski denies the charges.",
      "He fled to Hungary, saying he would not receive a fair trial in his homeland because of politicised prosecutors and judges under Poland's current pro-EU coalition government under Prime Minister Donald Tusk.",
      "Such reasoning was mocked by governing officials given that the Law and Justice-led government Mr Romanowski served in was widely condemned by international judicial bodies, the European Commission and European courts for introducing reform that politicised the judiciary.",
      "Mr Tusk's government is trying to undo that reform because it created a two-tier judicial system of judges appointed under Law and Justice and older judges, some of whom do not recognise the new judges because they consider their appointments unlawful.",
      "Law and Justice and Mr Romanowski have accused the current government of making illegal judicial appointments in its efforts to undo that reform.",
      "Until Thursday night, the 48-year-old opposition MP had not been seen for almost two weeks.",
      "He reportedly had not used his phones or bank cards since 6 December and failed to attend a court hearing three days later that ruled he be remanded in custody before trial.",
      "On Thursday, a European Arrest Warrant was issued by a Warsaw court acting on prosecutors' information he had fled to an EU country.",
      "There had been speculation that Mr Romanowski was in hiding in Hungary.",
      "On Thursday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the current Polish government was treating Hungary as an enemy and he would offer refuge to anyone facing political persecution in Poland.",
      "Mr Orban and Poland's Law and Justice party share ideological goals even though they fell out over Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine.",
      "They broadly agree that what they consider a liberal EU-elite is driving Europe away from its Christian traditions and eroding member states' sovereignty.",
      "Mr Romanowski is reportedly a member of conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, who issued a denial earlier this week that the MP was being hidden by them.",
      "In October 2022, he told a Polish Catholic radio station that LGBT+ was \"institutionalised deviancy\".",
      "A year later he advocated the death penalty, even for minors, after a 16-year-old boy was beaten to death by teenagers."

    "summary": "Putin tells an end-of-year press conference there should have been \"systemic preparation\" for the full-scale invasion.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia should have launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier and been better prepared for the war.",
      "In his end-of-year press conference on Thursday, Putin said, with hindsight, there should have been \"systemic preparation\" for the 2022 invasion, which he refers to as a \"special military operation\".",
      "Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and pro-Russian forces began a conflict in eastern Ukraine, but it was eight years later that Putin tried to seize Kyiv.",
      "During his four-hour long appearance, Putin also talked about Syria's deposed leader, Russia's more aggressive nuclear doctrine as well as domestic issues, like the price of butter.",
      "Billed as \"Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin\", the event was broadcast live across the main state TV channels on Thursday.",
      "Putin appeared in front of a large blue screen emblazoned with a map of the Russian Federation, complete with annexed parts of Ukraine.",
      "He took questions from members of the public, foreign journalists and pensioners - but it was a highly choreographed and tightly controlled affair.",
      "When asked by the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg whether he felt the country was in a better state than where his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had left it 25 years ago, Putin said Russia had regained its \"sovereignty\".",
      "\"With everything that was happening to Russia before that, we were heading towards a complete, total loss of our sovereignty.\"",
      "Asked about the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, Putin insisted it was not a defeat for the Kremlin - which supported President Bashar al-Assad militarily for years - but he admitted the situation was \"complicated\".",
      "He said he had not yet spoken to ousted Syrian leader, who fled to Moscow as rebel forces closed in on Damascus earlier this month, but planned to do so soon.",
      "He added that Russia was in talks with Syria's new rulers to retain two strategically important military bases on the Mediterranean coast and that Moscow would consider using them for humanitarian purposes.",
      "On US President-elect Donald Trump, Putin said the pair had not spoken in four years, but he was ready to meet him \"if he wants it\".",
      "When put to him he was in a weak position compared to Trump, who is set to take office in January, Putin quoted American writer Mark Twain: \"The rumours of my death are much exaggerated,\" prompting a smattering of laughs in the conference hall.",
      "Moving on to China, Putin said Russia's relations with its eastern neighbour had reached an all-time high and the two countries were coordinating actions on the world stage.",
      "\"In the last decade, the level and quality of our [Russia-China] relations have reached a point that has never existed throughout our entire history, \" he said.",
      "A lengthy portion of the session was focused on the war in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was \"open to compromises\" to end the war - although it was unclear what such compromises could entail.",
      "Russian forces are making progress on the frontlines \"everyday\", he said, describing his troops as \"heroes\".",
      "At one point, he produced a signed flag he said was given to him by Russian marines who were \"fighting for the motherland\" in the Kursk region, and ushered two observers to hold it behind him for the cameras.",
      "He also talked up Russia's construction projects in areas it has seized from Ukraine, claiming the standard of roads in the Ukrainian region of Luhansk had greatly improved since it was seized by Russia-backed forces in 2014.",
      "When asked by an audience member if the West had \"received the message\" on Russia's change to its nuclear doctrine, which Putin pushed through in November, he said \"you'll have to ask them.\"",
      "The new nuclear doctrine allows Russia to conduct a nuclear strike on any country, if it is backed by a nuclear power.",
      "That means if Ukraine were to launch a large attack on Russia with conventional missiles, drones or aircraft, that could meet the criteria for a nuclear response, as could an attack on Belarus or any critical threat to Russia's sovereignty.",
      "Putin also emphasised the capabilities of Russia's new intermediate-range ballistic missile, Oreshnik, which was used in a strike on Ukraine in November.",
      "In order to test its power, he suggested Russia should fire the Oreshnik towards Ukraine, and Ukrainian air defence - using US-supplied systems - should try to bring it down.",
      "As for the name \"Oreshnik\"? \"Honestly,\" Putin said with a smirk, \"No idea. No clue.\"",
      "A dominant theme throughout the event was \"Russian sovereignty\", with Putin claiming that less reliance on international partners - partly a result of Western sanctions - was one of the key achievements of his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "He said the economy was \"stable\", pointing to higher growth than countries like Germany, but admitted inflation of 9.1% was \"alarming\".",
      "In fact, the economy is overheating and highly reliant on military production - sometimes termed the \"military industrial complex\".",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:28:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Nelson Amenya is hailed as a hero in Kenya after sharing details of a plan to lease the main airport.",
    "story": [
      "Kenyan business student Nelson Amenya has been hailed as a hero by those campaigning for greater transparency in the deals his government makes with private firms.",
      "Recent Kenyan history is littered with stories of huge contracts that have resulted from corruption \u2013 and despite laws that are supposed to prevent this from happening, there are suspicions that it continues to take place.",
      "Thirty-year-old Mr Amenya, who is studying in France for an MBA, leaked details on social media of what he said was a proposed agreement between Kenya and the Adani Group, an Indian multinational, in July.",
      "It concerned the management of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) \u2013 the country's - and region's - biggest airport, which is long overdue a complete overhaul.",
      "\"The first feeling I had [when I was passed the documents] was that it was just another government deal\u2026 I did not understand the magnitude or the seriousness of it,\" Mr Amenya, whose profile as an anti-corruption activist had been on the rise, tells the BBC.",
      "The documents detailed a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) proposal by the Adani Group to lease JKIA for 30 years in order to modernise and run it.",
      "As he started to go through the papers, he felt that if it was to go ahead, it \"was going to hurt the Kenyan economy\" while all the benefit would go to the Indian multinational.",
      "The deal appeared unfair to him, according to what he read, as Kenya would still be putting in the largest share of the money but not reaping the financial rewards.",
      "Mr Amenya had good reason to think the papers were genuine as \"the people who were giving me these documents were from very legitimate departments of government\", he says.",
      "The Adani Group is involved in infrastructure, mining and energy projects globally, in countries such as Israel, the UAE, France, Tanzania, Australia and Greece. Its founder Gautam Adani is a big player in India's economy and is a close ally of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Through further reading, Mr Amenya says he discovered that the Adani deal with Kenya could have left his country with an obligation to pay the company if it did not recoup its investment.",
      "\"This was a great breach of trust of the people by the leadership of the president, the Kenya Airports Authority, the minister - they all betrayed the people,\" he alleges.",
      "Despite the evidence in his hands, Mr Amenya wrestled with what to do next. His own safety was at risk, though being in France he was better off than being in Kenya, where anti-corruption activists have been targeted and some killed.",
      "\"I was a bit scared. I didn't know what's going to happen. I'm risking my career, I'm risking my life, why should I take the risk to do this?\" he asked himself at the time.",
      "However, in the end he felt that staying quiet was not an option.",
      "\"You know, it's only cowards who live long.\"",
      "After spending weeks going through what he had been sent, Mr Amenya leaked the documents on his X page in July, immediately sparking outrage in Kenya.",
      "JKIA airport workers went on strike demanding that the deal be scrapped.",
      "\"It felt like a duty for me, for my country. Even if I am far away, I still have a duty for my country. I want to see a better Kenya, my home country becoming developed, industrialised and an end to corruption.\"",
      "He worried that the airport deal was a harbinger of what might come next.",
      "Mr Amenya says it was not just the unusual terms and lack of transparency that rang alarm bells, it was also, he alleges, that Kenyan laws appeared to have been systematically ignored.",
      "\"[The authorities] never did due diligence for this company\u2026 they did not follow the due process of procurement.\"",
      "He alleges that some government officials hoped to bypass the legal requirements, including public consultation, that are supposed to prevent taxpayers' money from being misspent.",
      "A report in April by the Kenya Airports Authority on the proposed deal highlighted that there was no plan to consult stakeholders on the plan.",
      "\"This was in April, and by July when I was exposing this, they had not done any public participation. It was quite secret this deal, and by that time they were just a month away from signing the deal,\" Mr Amenya alleges.",
      "\"After I exposed this deal is when they hurriedly tried to come and do like a sham public participation - they called the Kenya Airports Authority staff and started to have stakeholder meetings.\"",
      "Various officials and branches of the state denied allegations of corruption in the process and the authorities went ahead to sign another multimillion dollar deal with the Adani Group \u2013 this time to construct power lines.",
      "The Adani Group said Mr Amenya's claims were baseless and malicious.",
      "A spokesperson told the BBC that \"the proposal was submitted following Kenyan Public Private Partnership regulations and was intended to create a world class airport and significantly enhance the Kenyan economy by creating numerous new jobs\".",
      "The Adani Group further says that no contract was signed as \"discussions did not progress to a binding agreement\".",
      "The company also says the proposal for the energy deal was above board and that the company \"categorically refutes all allegations and insinuations of any violation of Kenyan laws in our operations or proposals.",
      "\"Every project we undertake is governed by a strong commitment to compliance, transparency and the laws of the respective countries in which we operate,\" the statement read.",
      "But it was not Mr Amenya's leak that actually changed the government's mind.",
      "It was only when the US authorities indicted Gautam Adani for alleged involvement in a $250m (\u00a3200m) bribery scheme that Kenya acted.",
      "Representatives from the Adani Group denied the allegations from US prosecutors and called them \"baseless\".",
      "At a state-of-the-nation address in parliament last month, Kenya's President William Ruto announced the cancellation of both Adani deals.",
      "\"In the face of undisputed evidence or credible information on corruption, I will not hesitate to take decisive action,\" Ruto said in a speech met with loud cheers inside parliament.",
      "Kenyans celebrated the decision which Ruto attributed to new information provided by investigative agencies and partner nations.",
      "\"I was in class when this announcement came. I couldn't believe it,\" Mr Amenya says.",
      "\"I think in the first one hour, I had tears in my eyes. I was so happy.\"",
      "Although he does not see himself as a hero, messages of support poured in from everywhere, including from India.",
      "Forty minutes after the class ended, he posted his now-famous tweet \"Adios Adani!!\" - goodbye Adani.",
      "\"It was momentous\u2026 All that I did finally paid off.\"",
      "The feeling of triumph, however, came after months of personal struggle and pressure.",
      "Soon after exposing the airport deal, Mr Amenya was sued for defamation by an Adani Group representative and a Kenyan politician, making him question whether he should continue.",
      "\"Some people were coming to me from the government, they were even ready to pay me, they were telling me: 'You need to cash out and just stop this fight with the government,'\" he recalls.",
      "\"It would have been the biggest mistake of my life to give up, a betrayal to the Kenyan people.\"",
      "But even after scrapping the deals, President Ruto still questions why Kenyans opposed this and many other projects he has championed. He says he will find a way to upgrade the airport.",
      "\"I saw them saying that those who stopped the upgrading of our airport are heroes. Heroes? What do you gain when you stop the building of an airport in your country?\" Ruto asked at a public function in early December.",
      "\"You have no clue how it's going to be built, and those who are opposed have never even stepped foot inside an airport, you just want to oppose.\"",
      "Mr Amenya, who is still facing the defamation cases, is now fundraising to help with his legal fees, and says his future in Kenya is uncertain.",
      "\"I have received threats from credible intelligence agencies and people in Kenya that have warned me not to go back because obviously there's some people who are very angry with what I did,\" he says.",
      "A hefty price, but one Mr Amenya says he would gladly pay again.",
      "\"We don't really need to wait for someone to save us,\" he says.",

      "Syria's rebel leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has dismissed the online controversy over videos showing him gesturing to a young woman to cover her hair before he posed for a photo with her last week.",
      "The incident sparked criticism from both liberal and conservative commentators amid intense speculation about the county's future direction after rebels swept to power.",
      "Liberals saw the request from the head of the Sunni Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a sign that he might seek to enforce an Islamic system in Syria after leading the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, while hardline conservatives criticised him for consenting to be photographed with the woman in the first place.",

      "The US could face a government shutdown at midnight on Saturday after President-elect Donald Trump called on Republican lawmakers to reject a bipartisan funding bill that would have kept the government funded through March.",
      "Trump urged Congress to scrap the deal and pass a slimmer version with fewer provisions. His intervention followed heavy criticism of the bill by tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "Congressman Steve Scalise, the Republican House Majority Leader, indicated on Wednesday night that the bill was dead after Trump denounced it.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:00:24 GMT",
    "summary": "As the longest serving G7 leader, the Canadian prime minister has weathered many storms. But this time might be different.",
    "story": [
      "It was one of the worst weeks of his political career, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was ringing in the season.",
      "At the Liberal Party's annual holiday gathering, Trudeau put on his party face, despite being blindsided the day before by the snap resignation of one of his most trusted allies, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, just hours before she was due to deliver an economic statement in Parliament.",
      "But even as some members of his own party were calling on him to leave, the prime minister struck a resolute, defiant tone as he addressed the party faithful in his dark blue suit and tie.",
      "He alluded to his \"difficult\" week, comparing it to a family fight.",
      "He discussed being \"audacious\" and \"ambitious\" in the face of adversity, and made pointed digs at his political rival, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada.",
      "Pundits remarked afterwards that it sounded a lot like a campaign speech, and that despite the latest political turmoil, Trudeau appears to be digging in.",
      "That stance did not change on Friday, even after the leader of the country's progressive New Democrat Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh said he would introduce a motion to topple Trudeau's government in the new year. It was the support of the NDP that had kept the Liberals in power. An election now appears imminent.",
      "Yet Trudeau has so far given no indication that he will resign soon, though he reportedly told fellow party members that he would take time over the winter holiday to think about what to do.",
      "Political observers say Trudeau has often shown a streak of defiance when he is under pressure, something that has helped him weather a number of controversies in his nine years in power.",
      "And he has often been underestimated, such as when he won a majority government in 2015 at the age of 44, despite being portrayed by his political opponents as something of a dilettante.",
      "But as pressure mounts on him to resign, some of those same experts say he may need a new strategy.",
      "Proving his doubters wrong",
      "When Trudeau first ran for prime minister, three words followed him around: Just not ready.",
      "That phrase was the tagline of an attack ad played repeatedly throughout the country as he tried to unseat the incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative who had been in power since 2004.",
      "It conveyed common criticisms he faced at the time about his young age, his relative lack of experience and his winding path to politics.",
      "Trudeau \"sort of meandered around\" in his early life before becoming a drama teacher in Vancouver, said Canadian historian Raymond Blake, seemingly insulated as the well-known and wealthy son of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.",
      "But not long after entering politics, Trudeau adopted a fighting stance.",
      "It is a trait that some say he learned from his father, who was known for his charismatic yet combative leadership style, and who is famous for his catchphrase of \"just watch me,\" which he glibly told a reporter at the height of a political crisis.",
      "\"His father had an image of really being a resilient, very tough politician,\" said Lawrence Martin, a long-time Canadian political columnist based in Washington DC.",
      "The younger Trudeau went on to defy the odds himself by pulling off a historic win for his Liberal party, taking them from third-place in parliament to a majority mandate in his first federal election.",
      "\"This kind of makes him feel that he can overcome big obstacles,\" said Mr Martin, adding that, politically, Trudeau operates with \"a hyper amount of self-confidence\".",
      "Trudeau's path to power turned bumpy once he had assumed office, after he became involved in a number of political scandals.",
      "In his first term, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould - the first indigenous woman to hold the job - quit over what she described as attempts at interference and \"veiled threats\" from top government officials seeking a legal favour for a firm facing a corruption trial.",
      "As he vied for a second term in 2019, Trudeau's re-election campaign was rocked by images that were released showing him as a younger man donning brown face on at least three occasions.",
      "And a year later, in 2020, Trudeau faced yet another ethics scandal involving a potentially large government contract for a youth charity that had worked with Trudeau family members.",
      "But in the face of every setback, Trudeau held on to power. He won re-election twice, making him the longest-serving leader of his G7 peers.",
      "\"Trudeau has survived so much,\" Prof Blake said, noting that his political successes and leadership have won the loyalty of many in his party despite the scandals.",
      "Is Freeland's exit a turning point?",
      "While Trudeau has weathered many storms, there are signs that his time may be up.",
      "For one, history is not on his side. Only one Canadian prime minister, Sir John A MacDonald - the country's first - served four consecutive terms.",
      "Trudeau is also working against a sinking popularity. A September poll from Ipsos suggested around two-thirds of Canadians disapprove of him. Just 26% of respondents said Trudeau was their top pick for prime minister, putting him 19 points behind Conservative leader Poilievre.",
      "And then there's the slowly dwindling support within Trudeau's own party. So far, at least 18 Liberal MPs have called for their leader to step down.",
      "\"He's delusional if he thinks we can continue like this,\" New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told reporters this week.",
      "\"It's unfair to us MPs, it's unfair to the ministers and most importantly it's unfair to the country. We need to move on with a new direction and we need to reboot.\"",
      "According to Long, who has driven the push to remove Trudeau, as many as 50 of the 153 Liberal MPs want him to quit immediately. Roughly the same number are Trudeau loyalists, he said, and the rest are on the fence.",
      "\"There's still some party loyalists who like him and, you know, want to still support him,\" said Mr Martin, the DC-based columnist. \"But if you had a secret vote of Liberal caucus about whether he should stay on or not, he would be defeated handily.\"",
      "The prime minister is also seemingly driven to stay by his disdain for his political opponent Poilievre, Mr Martin observed.",
      "\"He does not want to back down, and he does want to take on Pierre Poilievre, whom he detests,\" he said.",
      "Trudeau's stubborn perseverance in the face of a dismal political forecast has drawn  comparisons to outgoing US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his candidacy months before the November election only after mounting internal pressure.",
      "Prof Blake said that Trudeau's legacy, like Biden's, will hinge on how he exits. Fighting a losing battle, he said, could give Trudeau \"a lasting scar\". But the prime minister has a remarkable ability to survive, he noted.",
      "\"He's been a survivor, and he hasn't done what's normal. Will normal - whatever it is - fall into place this time? Perhaps, but I'm not convinced.\"",
      "Trudeau's dilemma is also similar to one faced by his father, who won three elections in a row, and went on to win a fourth after leaving power for less than a year.",
      "But by 1984, more than 15 years after first becoming prime minister, the elder Trudeau - like his son now - faced dire polls. It seemed clear he would not win the next election if he stayed on. He decided to step down, telling the public that he made the decision after taking a walk in an Ottawa snowstorm.",
      "Since then, the term \"walk in the snow\" has become synonymous with political resignation in Canada. This Christmas, it remains to be seen whether Trudeau will take his own walk.",

      "When a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the world's longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.",
      "\"I told him he was acquitted, and he was silent,\" Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.",
      "\"I couldn't tell whether\u202fhe\u202funderstood or not.\"",
      "Hideko\u202fhad been fighting for her brother's retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.",
      "In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted - ending Japan's longest running legal saga.",
      "Mr Hakamata's case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japan's justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.",
      "Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners' risk of developing a serious mental illness.",
      "And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didn't commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.",
      "Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hideko's close care.",
      "When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in \"his own world\" for years.",
      "\"Maybe it can't be helped,\" she says. \"This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.",
      "\"They made him live like an animal.\"",

      "A former professional boxer,\u202fIwao Hakamata \u202fwas working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the man's wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.",
      "Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (\u00a3199; $556) in cash.",
      "\"We had no idea what was going on,\" Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.",
      "The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.",
      "He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.",
      "Two years after his arrest, Mr\u202fHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.",
      "One prison visit in particular stands out.",
      "\"He told me, 'there was an execution yesterday - it was a person in the next cell',\" she recalls. \"He told me to take care - and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.\"",
      "Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japan's death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.",
      "\"Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution,\" Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.",
      "\"You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you don't know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.\"",
      "James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that \"the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading\". The report concluded that inmates were at risk of \"significant mental health issues\".",
      "Hideko could only watch as her own brother's mental health deteriorated as the years went by.",
      "\"Once he asked me 'Do you know who I am?' I said, 'Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata'. 'No,' he said, 'you must be here to see a different person'. And he just went back [to his cell].\"",
      "Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasn't until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.",
      "A key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.",
      "They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamata's defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his - and alleged that the evidence was planted.",
      "In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.",
      "Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hideko\u202fwho appeared in court, pleading for her brother's life.",
      "Mr Hakamata's fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.",
      "The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered - but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.",
      "That was enough to convince presiding judge\u202fKoshi Kunii, who declared that \"the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place\".",
      "Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.",
      "Hideko's first reaction was to cry.",
      "\"When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears,\" she says. \"I am not a tearful person, but my\u202ftears\u202fjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.\"",
      "Hostage justice",
      "The court's conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.",
      "Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called \"hostage justice\" which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, \"denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning\".",
      "\"These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions,\" Ms Doi noted in 2023.",
      "David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.",
      "He said one reason it dragged on is that \"critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010\".",
      "The failure was \"egregious and inexcusable\", Mr Johnson told the BBC. \"Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.\"",
      "Hideko\u202fsays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.",
      "But Mr Johnson says false accusations don't happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels - from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.",
      "\"Judges have the last word,\" he added. \"When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.\"",
      "Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamata's acquittal was a watershed - a rare moment of retrospective justice.",
      "After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised to\u202fHideko\u202ffor how long it took to achieve justice.",
      "A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visited\u202fher\u202fhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.",
      "\"For the past 58 years\u2026 we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden,\" Mr Tsuda said. \"We are truly sorry.\"",
      "Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.",
      "\"We believe that everything that happened was our destiny,\" she said. \"We will not complain about anything now.\"",
      "The pink door",
      "After nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwao\u202falongside family friends and supporters.",
      "Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her \"cute\" little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.",
      "The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.",
      "\"We were always together when we were children,\" she explains. \"I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.\u202f And so, it continues.\"",
      "She walks into Mr Hakamata's room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.",
      "\"He wanted to become a champion,\" she says. \"Then the incident happened.\"",
      "After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.",
      "\"I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.\"",
      "It's the first thing one notices when visiting Hideko's apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.",
      "It's unclear whether it has worked \u2013 Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.",
      "But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.",
      "When asked who she blames for her brother's suffering, she replies: \"no-one\".",

      "\"These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates.\"",
      "She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela.",
      "'Neo-crusade'",
      "While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has \"increased dramatically\" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall.",
      "Jagun, who is a babalorix\u00e1 (high priest) of the Candombl\u00e9 religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities.",
      "\"This is a form of neo-Crusade,\" he says. \"The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God.\"",
      "But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints.",
      "\"If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] \u00d2g\u00fan, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings.",
      "\"That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'.\"",
      "Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution \u2013 that of religious freedom.",
      "And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule."

    "title": "Five unanswered questions from the Pelicot trial",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 01:49:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Although the Pelicot trial is over, some questions remain over the case that shook France.",
    "story": [
      "French rape survivor Gis\u00e8le Pelicot walked out of a court in southern France for  the last time on Thursday after her ex-husband was  jailed for 20 years for drugging and raping her, and inviting dozens of strangers to also abuse her over nearly a decade.",
      "Dominique Pelicot, 72, was found guilty of all charges by a judge in Avignon. He was on trial with 50 other men, all of whom were found guilty of at least one charge, although their jail terms were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Although the trial is over, there are still questions lingering over the Pelicot case and what happens next.",
      "1. What will Gis\u00e8le Pelicot do now?",
      "When she climbed the steps of the Avignon courthouse for the first time in September, no one knew Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's name. Over the course of the next 15 weeks, her fame as a rape victim who refused to be ashamed of what had been done to her grew vertiginously.",
      "By the time she left the tribunal on Thursday, crowds of hundreds were chanting her name and her picture was on the front pages of newspapers worldwide.",
      "She is now perhaps one of the best-known women in France. This means that although she has stopped using her husband's surname, it will be impossible for her to return to the anonymity that served her so well as she tried to rebuild a life following the revelation of her husband's crimes.",
      "Gis\u00e8le is not the first person whose unimaginable suffering has turned her into an icon. At great personal cost, she has become the symbol of a fight she never chose. It seems unlikely, then, that she will want to become an outspoken activist against gender violence, or a prominent feminist figure. Rather, she may go back to what she has said has always given her solace: music, long walks and chocolate \u2013 as well as her seven grandchildren.",
      "\"At the start of the trial she said: 'If I last two weeks, that will be a lot.' In the end, she made it to three and a half months,\" her lawyer Stephane Babonneau said. \"Now, she is at peace, and relieved it's all over.\"",
      "2. What really happened to Caroline?",
      "Days after Dominique Pelicot's crimes came to light, his daughter Caroline Darian was summoned to the police station and shown photos of an apparently unconscious woman dressed in unfamiliar lingerie. Later, she said her life had \"stopped\" when she realised she was looking at photos of herself.",
      "Her father has always denied touching her, but Caroline \u2013 whose anguish and devastation were apparent in many court sessions \u2013 has said she would never believe him and accused him of looking at her \"with incestuous eyes\".",
      "But the lack of proof of the abuse Caroline is convinced was inflicted on her has led her to say she is \"the forgotten victim\" of the trial. That notion has visibly seeped into her relationship with her mother. In her memoir \u2013 published after her father's arrest \u2013 she accused Gis\u00e8le of not showing her enough support, implicitly choosing to side with her rapist ex-husband over her daughter.",
      "Although Gis\u00e8le and her children have always sat next to one another in court, often whispering huddled together, there have been signs of the toll the trial has taken on their relationship.",
      "On Friday, Caroline's brother David highlighted \u2013 as he has done before \u2013 that the trial had not just been about Gis\u00e8le but about their whole \"annihilated family\".",
      "\"Us children felt forgotten,\" he said. \"Very honestly I feel that while our lawyers did a remarkable job on the defence of our mother, we were a little bit less taken into account.\"",
      "In her memoir, Caroline lamented Gis\u00e8le's \"denial as a coping mechanism\".",
      "\"Because of my father,\" she wrote, \"I am now losing my mother.\"",
      "3. How many defendants will appeal?",
      "Apart from Dominique, all of the jail terms handed down to the defendants were less than what prosecutors had demanded.",
      "Several defence lawyers were visibly satisfied, meaning it is unlikely they will encourage their clients to appeal against their sentences. A man called Jean-Pierre Mar\u00e9chal got 12 years \u2013 five less than prosecutors had asked \u2013 and his lawyer Patrick Gontard told the BBC it was \"out of the question\" he would appeal.",
      "The months or years the men spent in pre-trial detention will count towards their total sentences, meaning that some may be freed soon if they have served their minimum term.",
      "One man who was facing 17 years ended up being sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, and his lawyer Roland Marmillot told the BBC that because he had already spent several years in jail it was likely he would be released relatively soon.",
      "Still, by the morning after the trial closed, two men each jailed for eight years had already appealed. More are expected to follow over the next ten days \u2013 the period of time appeals can be lodged for.",
      "4. What else could Dominique Pelicot be guilty of?",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted to assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris in 1999. A cloth imbued with ether was put over her mouth but she managed to fight the attacker off and he fled. It was only in 2021, after he was arrested for the crimes he inflicted on his wife Gis\u00e8le, that Pelicot's DNA was cross-checked with a speck of blood found on Marion's shoe, and he admitted to his guilt.",
      "He has, however, denied any responsibility in another cold case \u2013 the 1991 rape and murder of another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, for which there is no DNA. Investigators have argued that the two cases present too many similarities to be coincidental.",
      "Other cold cases where similar modi operandi were used are also being looked at again.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Dominique Pelicot's double life: Who is the man who plotted his wife's mass rape?",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "5. Will the trial be a turning point?",
      "\"There will be a 'before' and there will be an 'after' the Pelicot trial,\" one Parisian man told the BBC in the early days of the trial.",
      "For many, this sentiment has only grown over the last few months during which the intense media coverage of the Pelicot trial generated countless conversations around rape, consent and gender violence.",
      "\"What we need to do is have much, much harsher sentences,\" Nicolas and Mehdi, two residents of Mazan - the village where the Pelicots lived - told the BBC. They said they were \"disgusted\" when they found out one of the defendants was a man they had played football with.",
      "\"With longer sentences they'll at least they'll think twice before doing stuff like this,\" they said, adding that it was \"crazy unfair\" that some of the men could come out of jail in the next few months.",
      "It is worth noting, however, that the risk of incurring a 20-year prison sentence for aggravated rape did not deter Dominique Pelicot from offering his unconscious wife to be raped by strangers he met online.",
      "There have been calls to reform French legislation on rape to include consent, but that has stalled in the past and would take considerable work in the current divided French parliament.",
      "Some have argued that schools have a responsibility to better teach new generations about sex, love and consent. B\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, has said she believes \"change will not come from the ministry of justice but from the ministry of education\".",
      "Fran\u00e7oise, a resident of the area where Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot used to live, told the BBC she thinks a way must be found to bridge the gap between what children are taught in schools and the type of material they have access to online.",
      "\"Young people are so exposed to sex on the internet and at the same time schools are very prudish,\" she said. \"They should be much more open and frank to match and explain what kids see.\"",
      "What these exchanges show is that, while it will take time before any changes become tangible, a conversation has now started. It will continue until there are no more unanswered questions.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:11:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Army defectors say units sent to fight against Ukraine will have high morale but won't be battle hardened.",
    "story": [
      "What Haneul remembers most about his time in the North Korean military is the gnawing, continuous hunger. He lost 10kg in his first month of service, due to a diet of cracked corn and mouldy cabbage.",
      "Three months into training, he says almost his entire battalion was severely malnourished and needed to be sent to a recovery centre to gain weight.",
      "When they were later deployed as frontline guards to the border with South Korea, rice replaced corn. But by the time it reached their bowls, much had been siphoned off by rear units, and the remainder had been cut with sand.",
      "Haneul says his unit was among the best-fed, a tactic to stop them defecting to South Korea. But it failed to prevent Haneul.",
      "In 2012, he made a death-defying dash across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) \u2013 the strip of land dividing the North from the South.",
      "His experience and that of other military defectors helps shed light on the condition of thousands of North Korean troops deployed to the frontline in Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Pyongyang has reportedly sent around 11,000 troops to help Russian forces reclaim part of its Kursk region taken by Ukraine in a surprise summer offensive.",
      "Earlier this week, Seoul, Washington and Kyiv said the soldiers had now entered the fight \"in significant numbers\", and reported the first casualties, with South Korean officials estimating more than 100 had already been killed and more injured. This figure has not been confirmed.",
      "However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, most belong to the elite Storm Corps unit, and have \"high morale\", but \"lack an understanding of contemporary warfare\".",
      "Only the taller, sportier men are selected for the Storm Corps, says defector Lee Hyun Seung, who trained North Korea's special forces in the early 2000s before defecting in 2014.",
      "He taught them martial arts, how to throw knives and make weapons out of cutlery and other kitchen utensils.",
      "But even though the Storm Corps' training is more advanced than that of regular North Korean units, the soldiers are still underfed and even malnourished.",
      "Online videos, reportedly of the troops in Russia, show younger, \"frail\" soldiers, Haneul says. They are a stark contrast to Pyongyang's propaganda videos, where men are seen bursting out of iron chains and smashing blocks of ice with their bare hands.",
      "During his entire time in the army, Haneul says he fired only three bullets in a single live-fire training session.",
      "The closest he came to combat was when a hungry farmer stumbled into the DMZ looking for vegetables. Haneul says he ignored instructions to \"shoot any intruders\" and let the man go with a warning.",
      "It is difficult to know how much has changed in the decade since Haneul defected, given the scarcity of information from North Korea. It appears that the country's leader Kim Jong Un has directed much of his limited resources into missiles and nuclear weapons rather than his standing army.",
      "But according to another soldier, Ryu Seonghyun, who defected in 2019, the first three years in the military are \"incredibly tough\", even for the special forces. The 28-year-old, who worked as a driver in the air force for seven years, says that during his service, conditions deteriorated and rice gradually disappeared from meals.",
      "\"The soldiers are sent into the mountains for days with a small amount of rice, and are told it is part of their survival training.\"",
      "Given these troops have been trained to fight in the mountainous Korean Peninsula, the defectors question how well they will adapt to fighting on the flatlands and in the trenches of Kursk.",
      "Crucially, the Storm Corps are not a frontline unit. \"Their mission is to infiltrate enemy lines and create chaos deep within enemy territory,\" Ryu says.",
      "But, he adds, Kim Jong Un has no alternative to sending special forces, as regular soldiers spend most of their time farming, building or chopping wood.",
      "\"Kim Jong Un had to send men who could demonstrate at least a certain level of combat ability, to avoid damaging North Korea's reputation in Russia.\"",
      "The language barrier seems to have created an additional hurdle. On Sunday, Ukraine's defence intelligence unit said communication issues had resulted in North Korean soldiers accidentally firing on a Russian battalion, killing eight.",
      "With these assessments, it could be easy to dismiss the troops as \"cannon fodder\" and a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's desperation. But that would be a mistake, the defectors say. Their loyalty to the regime and fighting spirit will count for a lot.",
      "\"Most of the soldiers in the Storm Corps come from working-class or farming families, who are highly obedient to the party and will follow orders unquestionably,\" says Haneul, whose father and cousin were in the special forces.",
      "Intense, ideological \"brainwashing\" sessions, held every morning, will further ensure they are mentally ready, Lee adds.  He believes the North Korean troops \"will become accustomed to the battlefield, learn how to fight the enemy, and find ways to survive\".",
      "At least 100 North Koreans dead in Ukraine war, says South",
      "What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's war",
      "Although the soldiers will not have been given a choice over whether to be deployed, Ryu thinks many will have wanted to go. The ambitious will see it as an opportunity to advance their careers, he says.",
      "And given how tough it is to serve in North Korea, some will have relished the chance to experience life abroad for the first time.",
      "\"I think they'll be more willing to fight than Russian troops,\" he adds, admitting that in their situation, he too would have wanted to be sent.",
      "Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces, agrees with the defectors' appraisals. \"Just because they lack food and training, does not mean they are incapable. They will acclimatise quickly. We should not underestimate them.\"",
      "While 11,000 troops are unlikely to turn the tide of such an attritional war \u2013 it is estimated Russia is suffering more than a thousand casualties a day \u2013 experts and officials believe this could be just the first tranche, with Pyongyang potentially able to send up to 60,000 or even 100,000 if they are rotated.",
      "In these numbers, Mr Chun believes they could end up being effective.",
      "Also, Kim Jong Un will be able to shoulder big losses without affecting the stability of his regime, the former soldiers say.",
      "\"Those who have been sent will be men without influence or connections \u2013 to put it bluntly, those who can be sacrificed without issue,\" Haneul says.",
      "He remembers being shocked to learn there were no children of high-ranking parents in his frontline unit: \"That's when I realised we were expendable.\"",
      "He does not expect much resistance from the families of the deceased, whose sons, he says, will be honoured as heroes.",
      "\"There are countless parents who have lost a child after sending them to the military,\" he adds, recalling his second cousin who died. His aunt received a certificate, praising her son for his heroic contribution.",
      "The loyalty of the soldiers and their families could blunt Ukrainian and South Korean hopes that many will simply defect once they enter the fight. Kyiv and Seoul have discussed conducting psychological operations along the frontline to encourage the men to surrender.",
      "But it seems they do not have access to mobile phones. According to Ukrainian intelligence, even Russian soldiers' phones are seized before they encounter North Korean troops.",
      "So, possible infiltration strategies include broadcasting messages through loudspeakers or using drones to drop leaflets.",
      "Both Ryu and Haneul decided to defect after reading anti-regime propaganda sent across the border from South Korea. But they are doubtful this would work so far from home.",
      "They say it takes a long time to build up the desire and courage to defect.",
      "Furthermore, Haneul suspects the officers will have been ordered to shoot anyone who attempts to flee. He remembers his comrades opening fire as he made his daring sprint across the DMZ.",
      "\"Twelve bullets flew just a metre over my head,\" he says.",
      "Even capturing the North Korean troops may prove challenging for Ukraine.",
      "In the North, being a prisoner of war is considered extremely shameful and worse than death. Instead, soldiers are taught to take their own lives, by shooting themselves or detonating a grenade.",
      "Ryu recalls a famous military song entitled Save the Last Bullet. \"They tell you to save two bullets, one to shoot the enemy and one to shoot yourself.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the former special forces trainer Lee is determined to help. He has offered to go to the frontline to communicate directly with the soldiers.",
      "\"It's unlikely they will defect in large numbers, but we have to try. Hearing familiar voices like mine, and others from North Korea, might impact their psychology,\" he says.",
      "Haneul just hopes they get home to North Korea. He knows there is a chance some of his relatives are among the troops sent to help Russia.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:56:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The ex-husband - who is under investigation for other attacks - has a divided personality, a doctor finds.",
    "story": [
      "It was something in Dominique Pelicot's swagger, his \"\u00e9lan\" - as the French might put it - that immediately struck the psychiatrist as odd.",
      "There he stood. A 68-year-old pensioner who had already spent several months inside one of France's most notorious prisons, Les Baumettes in Marseilles. The prison was a grim, intimidating place, crowded with members of the port city's warring drug gangs.",
      "And yet the man in the visiting room who rose to greet Dr Laurent Layet on a cold day in February 2021 seemed \"clean, polished\u2026 He had just cut his own hair. He came towards me with this assertive attitude.\" Dr Layet was surprised, to put it mildly.",
      "The psychiatrist was the first of many people to scrutinise Dominique Pelicot. Each expert was looking for clues to explain how this apparently genial pensioner could have committed such grotesque crimes and deceived his unsuspecting victim for so long.",
      "In all his years interviewing hundreds of rapists and suspected rapists on behalf of French police and prosecutors, Dr Layet had never come across anyone quite like this grey-haired former electrician, calmly awaiting prosecution for drugging his wife Gisele and inviting dozens of strangers to rape her as she lay, unconscious, in the couple's bedroom.",
      "\"Something didn't fit. I had never encountered such an exceptional case,\" Dr Layet remembers thinking at the time.",
      "At the end of a gruelling, four-month trial that has enraged people across France and far beyond - even as they were inspired by the dignity and courage of Gisele - Dominique Pelicot's confident demeanour, a grandiose presence in the courtroom in Avignon, remained intact.",
      "One might expect a man in Pelicot's position - a globally reviled sexual predator, and rapist, facing the near-certain prospect of dying in prison - to cut a wretched figure. And there have been a handful of brief moments when he wept, openly, in court - usually for himself.",
      "But for the most part, he struck an imperious pose, courtroom microphone in one hand, his body slouched in a throne-like chair (to accommodate the accused's health issues), sometimes looking bored, occasionally interjecting like a ringmaster seeking to keep an unruly circus - the 50 other men on trial beside him - in their place.",
      "\"I am a rapist, like the others in this room. They knew everything,\" he intoned, speaking with the confidence of a man who assumed his words would put an end to all further discussion.",
      "But what are we to make of that domineering performance? And what have we really learned of this jowly, grey-haired figure, with his black cane and scarf, seated in a glass cage; this serial rapist whose cruelty has almost been eclipsed in the public imagination by the dignity and courage shown by his former wife?",
      "Dr Layet first encountered Dominique in the late summer of 2020 at a police station in the nearby town of Carpentras, immediately after his arrest for filming with a camera up women's skirts in a local supermarket. Called in to assess Pelicot, Dr Layet noted how breezily he dismissed his crime, like a genteel grandfather caught pocketing a few cigarettes.",
      "Dr Layet detected a \"dissonance\" in the man's behaviour, and the strong implication that he was hiding something more serious. He told the police that this one was worth closer inspection.",
      "In court, years later, after two long prison interviews with Pelicot and with more than 20 of the other accused, Dr Layet presented a more detailed assessment to the panel of judges.",
      "A measured and eloquent expert witness, Dr Layet stressed that Pelicot exhibited no signs of severe mental illness. He could not be dismissed as a \"monster\". Nor was he psychotic - unable to tell reality from fiction.",
      "And yet. There was a \"fissure\", a split, in Pelicot's personality.",
      "A showier witness might have borrowed from popular culture to compare him to a tormented Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or perhaps to Hannibal Lecter, stiff-backed in his prison cell in The Silence of the Lambs.",
      "Instead, Dr Layet reached for a mundane image.",
      "\"Almost like a hard drive,\" he suggested. A fitting metaphor, given that Pelicot had stored video evidence of his crimes on a computer memory card.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: How an ordinary woman shook attitudes to rape in France",
      "Who are the men convicted in the Gis\u00e8le Pelicot rape trial?",
      "Here's what you need to know about the Pelicot trial",
      "Later, in an interview with the BBC at his office in Carpentras, Dr Layet explained that Pelicot's mind had become divided, over time, like a partitioned computer disk, into two entirely separate \"water-tight parts\u2026 with no leakage between them. His split personality is very effective and very solid. We either have the 'normal Mr Pelicot' or the other Mr Pelicot at night, in the bedroom.\"",
      "Asked in court to explain that \"other\" Pelicot, Dr Layet said that he had detected a range of emotional and sexual abnormalities. They are, perhaps, most neatly captured in their original French, in a prosecution document seen by the BBC:",
      "\"Egocentrisme, fragilite narcissique, perturbations emotionnelles\u2026 une deviance paraphilique melant candaulisme, voyeurism et somnophilie.\"",
      "\"Egomania, narcissistic fragility, emotional disorders... an abnormal sexual deviancy combining candaulism [exposing your female partner to others for sexual enjoyment], voyeurism and somnophilia.\"",
      "Pelicot's own defence lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, enthusiastically embraced the \"split\" personality theory in her closing arguments at the trial. She suggested that the charming young man Gisele Pelicot had fallen in love with and quickly married back in 1973 \"was not the man that had harmed her\".",
      "But that is not what Dr Layet - or the other psychiatrists we have consulted for this article - meant.",
      "There may be two sides to Pelicot's behaviour, but there is - to stick with Dr Layet's computing metaphor - only one operating system that controls his cruel, private urges and his public demeanour.",
      "A simpler way of putting it is that Pelicot has an antisocial personality disorder - a term preferred by psychiatrists these days to words such as psychopath or sociopath. Several experts have concluded it is a reasonable diagnosis to use in the context of Pelicot's warped mind.",
      "He is not \"mad\" - he cannot claim diminished responsibility for his actions. But he does show well-established traits of a personality disorder characterised by a lack of empathy towards other humans. Those traits may have been sharpened by the sexual abuse he experienced as a child.",
      "Which brings us to another key question. Did Pelicot only become a rapist in retirement, or was he preying on women long before he began drugging his wife?",
      "Sitting towards the back of the courtroom one Tuesday afternoon late in the trial, surrounded by journalists tapping away on their laptops, Florence Rault looked at Dominique Pelicot with a particularly well-informed sense of disgust.",
      "\"It can be assumed that what happened in Mazan\u2026 is only the culmination of a long process,\" she said later, in a BBC interview.",
      "Ms Rault, a lawyer specialising in criminal cases, knew something deeply troubling about Pelicot - allegations of appalling crimes arguably more disturbing than those for which he was about to be convicted.",
      "For many years, she had been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s.",
      "More than 20 years before the rapes for which he has now been sentenced - in 1999 - Pelicot is accused of assaulting and attempting to rape a 23-year-old estate agent, known by the pseudonym Marion, in the suburbs of Paris. She fought the attacker off.",
      "He eventually admitted to being present at the scene in 2021 after DNA - a spot of blood on the victim's shoe - was finally found to match Pelicot's. But he continues to deny he attempted to rape her and the investigation continues.",
      "\"Once he was told that his DNA was found at the crime scene, he said 'Yes, it's me,'\" Ms Rault remembered.",
      "And that discovery quickly led to a link to an even older cold case. In 1991, another young estate agent, Sophie Narme, had been raped and murdered. Although crucial DNA evidence had gone missing, the similarities between the scenes were so striking that Pelicot is under investigation for the crime, which he denies. The search for other potential links to older crimes is also ongoing.",
      "If you've been affected by issues of sexual abuse, information and support is available at BBC Action Line.",
      "Ms Rault is not expecting any more confessions from Pelicot in relation to the cold cases.",
      "\"Until he's confronted with indisputable proof, he will deny [everything],\" said Ms Rault, who once sat beside Pelicot at a hearing and was struck, like Dr Layet, by his \"relaxed, rather serene\" demeanour.",
      "Ms Rault now watched him in the Avignon courtroom and saw the same behaviour. She also noted how Pelicot emphatically and tearfully denied drugging and raping his own daughter, Caroline, despite having taken deeply troubling photos of her, asleep, and without her knowledge.",
      "\"She's convinced that he sexually abused her too. But since we don't have any formal evidence like DNA to put in front of him, of course he will continue to deny it,\" said Rault, arguing that, for Caroline, the agony of uncertainty was as cruel and traumatic as the suffering of a victim who knew exactly what had happened to her.",
      "Pelicot's attitude towards his family in court was often revealing. The psychiatrist, Dr Layet, pointed out that the accused narcissistically focused on the love his wife and children once felt for him, not his betrayal of their trust.",
      "For Pelicot, this \"started out as a love story\" and he \"doesn't want this to be ignored\", said Dr Layet.",
      "But Ms Rault had come to court to look for other signs. Above all, she wanted to shore up her sense that Pelicot's crimes were highly premeditated.",
      "\"Serial rapists\u2026 usually have an impulse. They commit rape. They leave, and then they forget. This is not the case with [Pelicot] at all,\" she said.",
      "Ms Rault recalled the methodical actions of Marion's attacker inside an estate agent's office in 1999. The way he had made an excuse to return to his car - almost certainly to collect a rope and a bottle of ether to drug her. Then Ms Rault noted that the man in the glass cage in Avignon demonstrated a similar self-possession and saw it as further evidence that this was a deeply calculating criminal.",
      "\"When he says he has urges and acts on impulse, it's nothing like that. He is very calm.\"",
      "On the same day that Ms Rault was in the Avignon courtroom, I was sitting nearby. Gisele Pelicot was a few metres to our right. Dozens of the accused sat in front of us. Dominique Pelicot was over to the left side of the room.",
      "During a break in proceedings, I walked over to him. According to French law, journalists are not allowed to talk to the accused. Instead, I stood for a while and watched him as he sat in his chair, behind his glass wall, one hand on his stick. Then his head turned towards me, and he held my gaze for what must have been 20 seconds - although it felt much longer.",
      "His expression did not change. He did not seem to blink. And then, like a bored man switching between equally boring television channels, he looked away."

    "summary": "The BBC hears how roofs flew off homes as people sheltered inside in the cyclone-hit French territory.",
    "story": [
      "On the night Cyclone Chido hit the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, Zinedine was in his home, a small house made of corrugated iron and wood where he lives with eight of his relatives.",
      "Zinedine had received a warning from the authorities about the cyclone, but he didn't take it too seriously.",
      "\"I thought it was like in previous years when they warned that a cyclone was coming but it would just be a bit of rain. So we stayed home.\"",
      "This time however the island was about to be hit by winds of more than 124mph (200km/h) - the strongest cyclone to hit the island in almost a century",
      "So far 31 people are known to have died, according to French officials, and thousands more feared missing.",
      "When another, more urgent cyclone warning came through, Zinedine swung into action.",
      "\"I told my mum it's never happened before that they send a message like this so I think this time it's serious.\"",
      "He suggested they go to their neighbours' place, a bricks and mortar house not far from his, in a poor neighbourhood high up in the hills of Mayotte's Petite Terre, the smaller of its two islands.",
      "But his mum didn't want to go, and he felt he had to stay home with his family. The 20-year-old tourism student is the eldest boy in his family and feels responsible for them.",
      "When the storm started, he and his mum hid his younger siblings under a table. Then there was a loud noise.",
      "\"The iron roofing of our house flew off. We panicked and looked for shelter. There were iron sheets, wood and other big objects flying everywhere.\"",
      "He took his siblings to the neighbour's hut when he turned around he noticed his mum hadn't followed.",
      "\"I decided to go back outside to get my mother even though it was dangerous with the wind and everything. I'd rather die than leave my mum to die.\"",
      "His mother stood in the middle of their damaged house holding a one-year-old baby. She was terrified and wouldn't let the baby go. Zinedine snatched him from her arms and ran to give him to the neighbours. He eventually had to carry his mother out of the house.",
      "\"Luckily we're all safe but we've lost everything. The only things we were able to save were our papers and diplomas.\"",
      "Now he's trying to rebuild his family's home. Finding new building materials is incredibly difficult in Mayotte at the moment due to high demand, and he couldn't afford new roofing for his house so he tracked down some of the corrugated iron sheets that were blown off by the storm and plans to re-use them.",
      "\"I'm trying to do what I can. Even though I'm not a builder, I want to do it myself because I don't know if the authorities will help us.\"",
      "All across Mayotte, others like Zinedine are attempting to do the same, the sound of hammers ringing late into the night.",
      "But as resourceful as the people of Mayotte are, they're also angry at the lack of support they say they've received from the government.",
      "During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the islands on Thursday, he was booed whilst trying to make a speech. As he visited a hospital, frustrated staff complained of being overwhelmed.",
      "Most of the people we spoke to when in Mayotte were yet to receive any state aid, five days after the cyclone.",
      "\"We've only received food donations from volunteers who've also given us clothes and water. The mayor's office tried to help a bit but that's it\" says 18-year-old mother-of-three Yasmine Moussa.",
      "She took her three boys, the youngest of whom is just three months old, to the closest shelter, a secondary school in the neighbourhood of Labattoir, shortly after receiving the storm warning on Friday afternoon.",
      "\"On the day of the cyclone my children were crying because of the noise. When we  looked outside we saw corrugated iron roofs flying everywhere. They kept asking me what was happening, why everything was breaking,\" she said.",
      "\"I said to them it's just wind and rain but the next day when they saw everything was destroyed. They couldn't sleep that night.\"",
      "When she headed back home, she could hardly recognise her own neighbourhood.",
      "\"Mango trees had fallen during the storm and were blocking the roads. My neighbour had to point my house out to me because I couldn't even spot it. There was water everywhere, the toilet was broken, my TV, everything was ruined. I tried to save what I could.",
      "\"I was in tears, I never imagined this would happen.\"",
      "Now she has nowhere else to go. She says the conditions in the shelter are decent but she needs a house to take her children to. They now sleep on mattresses in one of the school's classrooms with a dozen other families.",
      "\"It's not normal to sleep like this. The doors don't lock and sometimes strangers walk in. I worry for my children's safety and that they will try to steal from us.\"",
      "The Red Cross told the BBC there are at least 100,000 people in shelters around Mayotte.",
      "President Macron has promised compensation for the uninsured, who make up the majority of the population, but he hasn't said how much they'll get.",
      "The needs are huge: almost all of the islands have to be rebuilt. But some on the political right in France argue that spending too much money in Mayotte will only encourage more undocumented migrants to come to the French territory.",

    "story": [
      "As the new Syria struggles to take shape, old threats are re-emerging.",
      "The chaos since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad is \"paving the way\" for the so-called Islamic State (IS) to make a comeback, according to a leading Kurdish commander who helped defeat the jihadist group in Syria in 2019. He says the comeback has already begun.",
      "\"Activity by Daesh [IS] has increased significantly, and the danger of a resurgence had doubled', according to General Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a mainly Kurdish militia alliance backed by the US. \"They now have more capabilities and more opportunities.\"",
      "He says that IS militants have seized some arms and ammunition left behind by Syrian regime troops, according to intelligence reports.",
      "And he warns there is \"a real threat\" that the militants will try to break into SDF-run prisons here in north-east Syria, which are holding about 10,000 of their men. The SDF is also holding about 50,000 of their family members in camps.",
      "Our interview with the general was late at night, at a location we can't disclose.",
      "He welcomed the fall of the Assad regime - which detained him four times. But he looked weary and admitted to frustration at the prospect of fighting old battles once again.",
      "\"We fought against them [IS] and paid 12,000 souls,\" he said, referring to the SDF's losses. \"I think at some level we will have to go back to where we were before.\"",
      "The risk of an IS resurgence is heightened, he says, because the SDF is coming under increasing attacks from neighbouring Turkey - and rebel factions it supports - and must divert some fighters to that battle.   He tells us the SDF has had to stop counter terrorism operations against IS, and hundreds of prison guards - from a force of thousands - have returned home to defend their villages.",
      "Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the PKK - banned Kurdish separatists who have waged an insurgency for decades, and are classed as terrorists by the US, and the EU. Turkey has long wanted a 30km \"buffer zone\" in the Kurdish region in northeastern Syria. Since Assad's fall, it is pushing harder to get it.",
      "\"The number one threat is now Turkey because its airstrikes are killing our forces,\" said General Abdi. \"These attacks must stop, because they are distracting us from focusing on the security of the detention centres,\" he said, \"though we will always do our best.\"",
      "Inside Al-Sina, the largest prison for IS detainees, we saw the layers of security and felt the tension among the staff.",
      "The former educational institute in the city of Al-Hasakah holds about 5,000 men - suspected fighters or supporters of IS.",
      "Every cell door is padlocked and secured with three bolts. The corridors are divided into sections by heavy iron gates. The guards are masked, with batons in hand. Getting access here is rare.",
      "We were allowed a glimpse inside two cells but could not speak to the men inside. They were told we were journalists and were given the option of hiding their faces. Few did. Most sat silently on blankets and thin mattresses. Two men paced the floor.",
      "Kurdish security sources say most of the prisoners in Al-Sina were with IS until its last stand and were deeply committed to its ideology.",
      "We were taken to meet a 28-year-old detainee - thin and softly spoken - who did not want to be named. He said he was speaking freely, though on the key issues he wouldn't say much.",
      "He told us he left his native Australia at the age of 19, to visit his grandmother in Cyprus.",
      "\"From there, one thing led to another,\" he said, \"and I ended up in Aleppo.\" He claimed he was working with an NGO in the city of Raqqa when IS took over.",
      "I asked if he had blood on his hands, and was involved with killing anyone? \"No, I wasn't,\" he replied, barely audibly.",
      "And did he support what IS was doing? \"I don't wish to answer that question because it might have an effect on my case,\" he replied.",
      "He hopes to get back to Australia one day, though he's unsure if he will be welcome.",
      "About three hours drive from Al-Sina, behind the wire of Roj camp, many believe that freedom is coming. Somehow.",
      "This bleak expanse of tents - ringed by walls, fences and watch towers - is home to almost 3,000 women and children. They have never been tried or convicted but they are the families of IS fighters and supporters.",
      "There are several British women in the camp. We met three of them, briefly.  All said they had been told by their lawyers not to speak.",
      "In a windswept corner we came across a woman willing to talk - Saida Temirbulatova, 47, a former tax inspector from Dagestan. Her nine-year-old son, Ali, stood quietly by her side. She hopes the overthrow of Assad will mean freedom for them both.",
      "\"The new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa [the head of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham] made an address, saying he will give everyone their freedom. We also want freedom. We want to leave, most likely for Russia. It's the only country that will take us.\"",
      "The camp manager tells us that others believe IS will come to their rescue and break them out. She asked us not to use her name as she fears for her safety.",
      "\"Since the fall of Assad, the camp is calm. Typically, when it's this quiet, it means the women are organising themselves,\" she said. \"They have packed their bags ready to go. They say: 'We will get out of this camp soon and renew ourselves. We will come back again as IS.'\"",
      "She says there's a visible change, even in the children, who chant slogans and swear at passersby. \"They say: 'We will come back and get you. It [IS] is coming soon.'\"",
      "During our time in the camp many children raised the index finger of their right hands. This gesture is used by all Muslims in daily prayer, but it's also widely used by IS militants.",
      "The women in Roj camp aren't the only ones packing their bags.",
      "Some Kurdish civilians in the city of Al-Hasakah are doing the same - fearing a comeback by the jihadis and another ground offensive by Turkey in north-eastern Syria. This would be the fourth invasion by Turkish forces. It's expected soon.",

    "title": "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 01:39:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The rebel offensive that ended Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule has left Syria facing an uncertain future",
    "story": [
      "Last week, while touring Damascus, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) was approached by a young woman who asked for a photo with him. He gently requested that she cover her hair before taking the picture.",
      "The incident quickly sparked heated debate across Arabic social and mainstream media.",
      "What happened may have been small but it was telling because it encapsulated the tightrope that Syria's new rulers Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - who are designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK - must walk.",
      "On one side is the diverse, and, in some cases more liberal, Syrian population, along with the international community, whose acceptance is crucial for HTS's survival and legitimacy. To them, the hair covering incident offered a troubling glimpse into Syria's potential future under HTS, expressing fears that conservative policies could eventually mandate the veil for all women.",
      "On the other side, Islamist hardliners criticised al-Sharaa for taking the photo at all, describing the woman as a \"mutabarijah\" - a term for a woman perceived to dress immodestly or wear makeup - and insisting his action violated religious rules.",
      "These hardliners hold significant sway over militant factions and could rally opposition within al-Sharaa's own Islamist base.",
      "HTS faces the challenge of attempting to reconcile these competing demands - balancing the expectations of the international community and the liberal parts of Syria's population with the demands of the hardline base. Both sides are closely scrutinising HTS's every statement and action.",
      "The group's ability to navigate these tensions will be critical to maintaining control and pursuing its political ambitions.",
      "In his messages, he has focused on coexistence within Syria's diverse society, granted amnesty to former military conscripts, prohibited acts of vigilante revenge against ex-government personnel and loyalists, and adopted neutral and at times conciliatory language when addressing traditional adversaries, including Israel, the US, Iran and Russia.",
      "His statements have been deliberately devoid of inflammatory rhetoric or threats, instead centring on themes of reconciliation, stability, and reconstruction, in a clear effort to neutralise opposition and push for the removal of HTS and al-Sharaa himself from international terror lists.",
      "Significant unease",
      "It is still unclear whether al-Sharaa's flexible approach represents a genuine ideological shift or a calculated strategy aimed at winning approval and consolidating power before potentially implementing a stricter and more religiously conservative agenda.",
      "But already his more progressive moves are sparking significant unease among hardliners in Syria, who insist on an Islamist government rooted in a strict and distinctive Sunni identity. While Sunni Arabs are the dominant ethnic and religious group in Syria, the country is notably diverse, with a range of minority groups including Shia Alawites, of which the ousted president Bashar al-Assad is a member, Kurds, Christians, Druze, Turkmen and Ismailis, in addition to other small groups.",
      "Even if HTS leadership is sincere in its push for change, the diverse range of Islamist and jihadist factions deeply entrenched in Syria - many of which played key roles in the recent offensive - are unlikely to tolerate anything short of a strict Islamist system. Should HTS deviate from such a path, these factions would likely be prepared to resort to armed resistance to enforce their vision.",
      "However this is not a new challenge for HTS.",
      "From IS to al-Qaeda to HTS",
      "For a decade the group, formerly known as al-Nusra Front and with roots in transnational jihadist movements, has been evolving.",
      "HTS transitioned from being a covert offshoot of the ultra-hardline IS around 2011 and 2012, to being affiliated to the relatively more flexible al-Qaeda the following year, and by 2016 to an independent faction.",
      "It consolidated its control of Idlib province in north-west Syria in 2017, running a civilian \"government\" in the area purportedly with no lasting jihadist connections or ambitions.",
      "This evolution reflects al-Sharaa's strategic vision and likely incorporates elements of opportunism and pragmatism aimed at ensuring the group's acceptance and long-term survival. HTS's strategy of signalling that it poses no external threat has already borne fruit.",
      "While its former jihadist partners, al-Qaeda and IS, were heavily targeted in Syria by the US-led coalition - resulting in the routine assassination of their leaders, often in Idlib itself - al-Sharaa has operated with relative freedom.",
      "Despite a $10m (\u00a37.8m) US bounty on his head, he has been able to frequently appear publicly, attending events and engaging with the population, much like a statesman.",
      "However, al-Sharaa's jihadist critics accuse him of being a manipulative politician, willing to compromise on key ideological principles to advance his own career and secure political gains for HTS, at the expense of other militant groups operating in the country.",
      "How rebels won hearts and minds",
      "HTS solidified its authority in Idlib through a dual strategy: winning the hearts and minds of local populations through offering some form of stability, while using force to stamp out or co-opt rivals and even former allies.",
      "The group moved away from distinctive jihadist rhetoric, fighting for religion, and the establishment of Islamic rule (Sharia) in Syria, as part of a wider interconnected global project. Instead, they adopted a more \"revolutionary\" and nationalist narrative, focusing on the singular goal of toppling Syria's president Bashar al-Assad and \"liberating\" Syria.",
      "The civilian front established by HTS in 2017 to administer Idlib was called the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG). The aim was to demonstrate HTS's governance capabilities, and bolster its legitimacy. This move was likely also aimed at alleviating fears about militants running a province, seeking to distance itself from the brutal image associated with IS's rule over territories in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The SSG operated as a mini-state, complete with a prime minister, ministries and local departments managing key sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, all while adhering to a religious council guided by Sharia (Islamic law). It also established professional-looking military and police academies, frequently showcasing their graduation ceremonies and organising military parades, typically attended by al-Sharaa.",
      "The SSG frequently showcased its achievements in reconstruction and service provision. It often contrasted these efforts with the dire conditions and rampant corruption in areas controlled by the Syrian government or rival rebel groups. Al-Sharaa even twice attended Idlib's annual book fair, giving speeches.",
      "But HTS faced significant challenges in Idlib, and its rule was far from smooth.",
      "Prior to the 27 November HTS-led rebel offensive, the group was dogged by anti-HTS protests, particularly targeting al-Sharaa's leadership. Protesters accused HTS of suppressing dissent through forced disappearances and imprisonment of opponents and critics.",
      "The group also faced criticism for allegedly colluding with foreign powers to undermine \"the jihad\" in Syria. In 2023, it was further rocked by a scandal involving spies within its top leadership, and was accused by hardliners of deliberately avoiding meaningful combat against government forces to please unnamed foreign backers.",
      "During such protests, al-Sharaa was frequently likened to Assad, while HTS's security apparatus was compared to the \"Shabiha\", Assad's notorious loyalist militia.",
      "However, it is important to note that many of HTS's critics, past and present, and some of the those imprisoned by the group, were hardliners actively inciting opposition to HTS's project in Idlib. Others were locals and activists who criticised what they described as HTS's monopolisation of power and \"authoritarian\" rule.",
      "Hardliners vs liberals: Religious restrictions",
      "Although some locals have voiced complaints about religious restrictions in Idlib, as reported by Arab media and NGOs, these grievances have not been widespread. This may be due to HTS's relative flexibility and the fact that most residents of the province are conservative Sunni Muslims who may be generally accepting of the status quo.",
      "Indeed, HTS has often come in for harsh criticism by hardliners for being too \"lenient\" and failing to impose strict Sharia rules in Idlib.",
      "Al-Sharaa has argued that the imposition of strict rules such as the morality police is an outdated idea that often causes more harm than good. In April 2023 he said: \"We don't want to create a hypocritical society that prays when we're around and doesn't when we're gone.\" He emphasised that he wanted people to adhere to Islamic teachings out of conviction, \"not through the stick [force]\".",
      "Despite these comments, the group has often responded by employing strict measures in a clear effort to appease hardliners - a pattern that offers insight into how HTS may respond to such pressures in future.",
      "For example, despite dissolving various Hisba (morality police) structures that operated under thinly-veiled names and despite the vocal objections of al-Sharaa himself, the SSG nevertheless established a \"public morality police\" under its Ministry of Interior in early 2024.",
      "These morality forces regulated shops, ensured women wore compliant religious clothing and limited the mixing of sexes in public spaces.",
      "And a few months earlier, the SSG's Ministry of Education had issued a decree mandating that all female students and staff wear \"loose Islamic dress that complies with Sharia\", which includes covering one's hair and avoiding \"fashion and trends\" deemed \"incompatible with our religious teachings\". The decree also prohibited the mixing of sexes in primary and secondary schools.",
      "Other rebel rivalries",
      "Until recently, the dominant feature of Syria's opposition groups - whether rebel or jihadist - was disunity and fragmentation, often marked by bouts of infighting. Armed factions competed over territory, revenue sources, authority and ideology.",
      "For years, this persistent disunity, among other factors, severely hampered their ability to achieve victory over Assad.",
      "The recent rebel unity that led to Assad's downfall remains a relatively new development and could still prove fragile. Also, there are internal challenges still posed by rival factions.",
      "HTS has long had a strained relationship with the other major rebel bloc in Syria, the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The SNA's focus during the recent offensive has largely aligned with Ankara's priorities - seizing Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria to eliminate what Turkey perceives as a Kurdish \"threat\" along its borders.",
      "Whether the two blocs can agree on the division of the strategic locations seized from Kurdish forces - or across Syria more broadly - remains uncertain, particularly as HTS continues to push for complete unity, clearly under its own leadership.",
      "IS, which remains active in Syria through both operatives and sleeper cells, has declared its ongoing jihad in the country and denounced the HTS-led rebel authority as \"apostates\" allegedly brought to power by \"infidel\" forces.",
      "With the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) weakening in the northeast, IS is likely to set its sights on the prisons and camps in Hasaka that hold IS-linked fighters and their families. A mass release or escape from these facilities could significantly bolster IS's ranks and ability to destabilise Syria.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011 - and Assad's brutal crackdown on the uprising - the country has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, clerics and transnational jihadist groups, facilitated by porous borders, particularly via Turkey.",
      "To consolidate its control over Idlib, and possibly as part of deals with foreign powers to contain the jihadist threat in northern Syria, HTS crushed some local and foreign factions and co-opted others, integrating them into its own structures, renaming their units to obscure their foreign origins. These include smaller factions from Central Asia, the Caucasus (Chechens) and China's Uighur minority.",
      "Many of these smaller factions, including independent jihadist groups like Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Tawhid, actively participated in the latest offensive, which highlights their potential vested interest in shaping the future of the new Syria.",
      "In terms of post-Assad messaging, groups like al-Qaeda as well as more moderate Islamist figures and scholars have reminded HTS about its \"obligation\" to ensure the set-up of an Islamic system in Syria, distinguished by a strong Sunni identity.",
      "'Power grab'",
      "When asked by a CNN correspondent on 6 December whether HTS intends to impose an Islamic system, al-Sharaa gave a characteristically evasive response. Instead of a direct \"yes\" or \"no\", he stated, \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\"",
      "This carefully worded answer suggest that HTS likely plans to implement Islamic governance, but perhaps in a more flexible and nuanced form.",
      "But already since HTS toppled the Assad government, ideological tensions have begun to resurface after the initial euphoria and unified effort to achieve a common goal. On 9 December HTS issued a decree granting amnesty to former military conscripts, but hardliners in Syria denounced the move as overly \"lenient\" and inconsistent with Sharia law, going so far as to incite disobedience and call for revenge attacks against ex-government loyalists, directly defying the HTS order.",

      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "HTS attempted to quell the uproar by issuing a statement clarifying that it would pursue former government personnel and loyalists implicated in war crimes - an apparent attempt to appease critics. At the same time, HTS sought to reinforce its authority, explicitly vowing to punish anyone who defied its decree by engaging in vigilante revenge.",
      "Another point of contention arose on 16 December when al-Sharaa announced plans to disband and disarm militant groups and militias in the country, concentrating weapons in the hands of the state and the military alone.",
      "Again, hardliners protested, urging factions to retain their arms. They argued the move would consolidate power under HTS, leaving no other groups armed to challenge its authority and paving the way for tyranny.",
      "Further discontent emerged over HTS's muted response to repeated Israeli airstrikes in Syria following Assad's fall. After days of silence, on 14 December al-Sharaa criticised the strikes but stated that his group had no intention of engaging in any new conflicts, emphasising its current focus on rebuilding Syria. He also stated that he would not allow Syria to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.",
      "Some viewed this stance as weak and a betrayal of Islamist principles. Their frustration was amplified by al-Qaeda's recent message urging HTS to prioritise the fight against Israel and fulfil its \"obligation\" to defend Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "These tensions suggest that hardliners - both within HTS ranks and external factions - may be willing to take up arms against the group if they perceive it as straying too far from their vision for a new religious Syria.",
      "Many of these individuals and factions are deeply invested in the country and are unlikely to relinquish their ambitions easily. They view Syria, much like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as a project for a strong Sunni Islamic state - one that could wield regional influence while serving as a safe haven for persecuted Muslims and jihadist fugitives.",
      "Under pressure from liberals and hardliners alike, al-Sharaa and HTS are treading a fine line in an attempt not to antagonise either side too much and the need for flexibility appears to be key.",
      "A week ago the young woman wanting a photo was asked to cover her hair.",
      "This week al-Sharaa was photographed with two British diplomats, one of whom was Ann Snow, the UK's special representative for Syria. Her hair was uncovered.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 00:07:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Leaked intelligence from military spies is helping turn the civil war in the resistance\u2019s favour, BBC finds.",
    "story": [
      "The once formidable Myanmar military is cracking from within - riddled with spies secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels, the BBC has found.",
      "The military only has full control of less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a BBC World Service investigation reveals.",
      "The junta still controls the major cities and remains \"extremely dangerous\" according to the UN special rapporteur on Myanmar. But it has lost significant territory over the past 12 months - see map below.",
      "The soldier spies are known as \"Watermelons\" - green on the outside, rebel red within. Outwardly loyal to the military but secretly working for the pro-democracy rebels whose symbolic colour is red.",
      "A major based in central Myanmar says it was the military's brutality that prompted him to switch sides.",
      "\"I saw the bodies of tortured civilians. I shed tears,\" says Kyaw [not his real name]. \"How can they be so cruel against our own people? We are meant to protect civilians, but now we're killing people. It's no longer an army, it's a force that terrorises.\"",
      "More than 20,000 people have been detained and thousands killed, the UN says, since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021 - triggering an uprising.",
      "Kyaw initially thought about defecting from the army, but decided with his wife that becoming a spy was \"the best way to serve the revolution\".",
      "When he judges it safe to do so, he leaks internal military information to the People's Defense Forces [PDF] - a network of civilian militia groups. The rebels use the intelligence to mount ambushes on the military or to avoid attacks. Kyaw also sends them some of his wage, so they can buy weapons.",
      "Spies like him are helping the resistance achieve what was once unthinkable.",
      "The BBC assessed the power balance in more than 14,000 village groups as of mid-November this year, and found the military only has full control of 21% of Myanmar's territory, nearly four years on from the start of the conflict.",
      "The investigation reveals that ethnic armies and a patchwork of resistance groups now control 42% of the country's land mass. Much of the remaining area is contested.",
      "The military now controls less than at any time since they first took control of the country in 1962, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled).",
      "Co-ordinated operations between ethnic armies and civilian militia groups have put the military on the back foot.",
      "After heavy territorial losses earlier this year Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing made a rare admission that his forces were under pressure.",
      "The leaked Watermelon intelligence from within the military is helping to tip the balance. Two years ago, the resistance set up a specialised unit to manage the growing network of spies and to recruit more.",
      "Agents like Win Aung [not his real name] collect the Watermelon leaks, verify them where possible, and then pass them on to the rebel leaders in the relevant area.",
      "He is a former intelligence officer who defected to the resistance after the coup. He says they are now getting new Watermelons every week and social media is a key recruitment tool.",
      "Their spies, he says, range from low-ranking soldiers to high-ranking officers. They also claim to have Watermelons in the military government - \"from the ministries down to village heads\".",
      "They are put through a strict verification process to ensure they are not double agents.",
      "Motivations for becoming a spy vary. While in Kyaw's case it was anger, for a man we are calling \"Moe\" - a corporal in the navy - it was simply a desire to survive for his young family.",
      "His wife, pregnant at the time, pushed him to do so, convinced the military was losing and he would die in battle.",
      "He began leaking information to the Watermelon unit about weapons and troop movements.",
      "This kind of intelligence is crucial, says pro-democracy rebel leader Daeva.",
      "The ultimate goal of his resistance unit is to take control of Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city and his former home. But they are a long way off.",
      "The military retains the majority of major urban areas - home to crucial infrastructure and revenue.",
      "\"It's easier said than done to attack and occupy [Yangon], Daeva says. \"The enemy will not give up on [it] easily.\"",
      "Unable to physically penetrate the city, Daeva from his jungle base directs targeted attacks by underground cells in Yangon using Watermelon intelligence.",
      "In August, we witnessed him making one such call. We were not given the details but were told it was to direct an assassination attempt on a colonel.",
      "\"We will do it inside the enemy's security parameters,\" he told them. \"Be careful, the enemy is losing in every direction,\" he added, telling them that this meant they were more likely to be on alert for infiltrators and spies.",
      "Daeva says several major attacks by his unit have been the result of tip-offs.",
      "\"We started with nothing and now look at our success,\" says Daeva.",
      "But it comes at a cost. Watermelons have to live in fear of both sides, as navy corporal-turned spy Moe discovered.",
      "Deployed from Yangon to Rakhine - a border region where the military is fighting an ethnic group siding with the resistance - he had to live with the terror that his intelligence could mean he himself was attacked.",
      "In March this year, his anchored ship was hit with a projectile missile, followed by open fire. \"There was no place to run. We were like rats in a cage.\" Seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in the rebel attack.",
      "\"Our ability to protect [the moles] is very limited,\" admits Win Aung. \"We can't publicly announce that they are Watermelons. And we can't stop our forces from attacking any particular military convoy.\"",
      "He says that when this is explained to the Watermelons, however, they do not falter. Some have even responded: \"When it comes to that moment, don't hesitate, shoot.\"",
      "Outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "But there are times when the spies can no longer bear the danger.",
      "When Moe was set to be sent to another dangerous front line, he asked the Watermelon unit to smuggle him out into a resistance-controlled area. They do this using an underground network of monasteries and safe houses.",
      "He left in the dead of night. The next morning, when he did not show up for duty, soldiers came round to the house. They interrogated his wife Cho, but she remained tight-lipped.",
      "After days on the run Moe arrived at one of Daeva's bases. Daeva thanked him over video call, before asking him what role he wanted to play now. Moe replied that, given his young family, he would like a non-combat role and would instead share his knowledge of military training.",
      "A few weeks later he crossed into Thailand. Cho and the children fled their home too and hope to eventually join him and build a new life there.",
      "The military is aggressively trying to reclaim lost territory, carrying out a wave of deadly bombings. With Chinese- and Russian-made fighter jets, it is in the air that it has the upper hand. It knows that the resistance is far from being one homogenous group and is seeking to exploit divisions between them.",
      "\"As the junta loses control, their brutality increases. It's getting worse. The loss of life\u2026 the brutality, the torture as they lose ground, literally and figuratively,\" says UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews.",
      "The military is also conducting sweeps for Watermelons.",
      "\"When I heard about the sweeps, I stopped for a while,\" says Kyaw. He says he always acts like a staunch supporter of the military to avoid unwanted attention.",
      "But he is scared and doesn't know how long he can stay hidden. Defecting is not an option, as he worries about abandoning his ageing parents, so for now, he will keep acting as a military spy, hoping to see a day when the revolution is over.",
      "If and when that day comes, Watermelons like Kyaw and Moe will not be forgotten, Win Aung vows.",
      "\"We will treat them with honor, and allow them to choose what they want to do next in their lives.\"",
      "The military did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "About the data:",
      "Researchers commissioned by the BBC questioned multiple sources from 12 February to 13 November 2024 for each of more than 14,000 village groups to assess the level of military control in their area.",
      "The names and boundaries of village groups were sourced from the Myanmar Information Management Unit, or MIMU, which is hosted by the UN Development Programme (UNDP).",
      "In every case, the research team spoke to at least one source with no official affiliation to the military or the opposition - such as academics, charity workers, journalists and local residents.",
      "When sources provided conflicting information for a village group, unaffiliated sources were prioritised and further cross-referenced with media reporting.",
      "Responses were divided into three possible categories of control:",
      "Military: The military is present and active in the region. It operates a local administration or provides certain public services, which are all functioning normally.Contested: The military is present in the region, but there are limits to its effective control. This could include areas where general administration and public services are not fully operational, or where the military divides administration with regional ethnic armed forces. It also covers areas where opposition forces can enter and exit, and where skirmishes between opposing forces occur.Resistance groups and ethnic armies: The military is largely absent and has not performed on-the-ground operations for more than three months. Civil services may be provided by resistance forces, ethnic armies or a civilian government, likely supported by a rebel armed militia.",

      "When I left London almost two weeks ago after the rebel coalition captured Aleppo - a stunning victory dwarfed by what followed - I thought I would be reporting a shooting war.",
      "The group known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was sweeping all before it, but I assumed that the regime would fight, as it did not stop doing as it was losing ground in the years before the Russians intervened in 2015 to bomb Syrian towns and villages to rubble.",
      "Almost a decade later, it was clear that Bashar al-Assad's Russian, Iranian and Lebanese allies had other wars to think about.",
      "But while the regime struggled with unwilling conscripts, it could always find Syrians who were prepared to fight and die for it, even at the height of the war after 2011, when rebels controlled much of Damascus outside the city centre and the road to Beirut.",
      "I visited those men on the front line many times.",
      "Many of the most effective units were led by officers from Assad's own Alawite community.",
      "In Aleppo in around 2015 an Alawite general handed out glasses of perfectly distilled arak, poured from bottles that once held Jack Daniels.",
      "Proudly, he said the arak, an aniseed based spirit popular across the Middle East, came from the Assad family's home town in the hills behind the port of Latakia. Outside, his unit was pounding the rebel-held east side of the city.",
      "Not all were Alawites. In Jobar, a district on the edge of central Damascus, a Christian officer loyal to Assad from the Syrian Arab Army took me into the tunnels they had dug under the ruins to attack rebels.",
      "He told how the rebels also had tunnels and how sometimes they would break into each other's, killing in the darkness.",
      "The young man had a crucifix tattooed on his wrist and another hanging around his neck, and he talked about how he had to fight to protect his community against jihadi extremists on the other side.",
      "My instincts about the fighting spirit of Assad's depleted band of loyalists could not have been more wrong.",
      "On Saturday 7 December I went to sleep after hearing the news that Homs had fallen.",
      "By the time I woke up Bashar al-Assad was on his way to Russia and rebel fighters were starting to celebrate on the streets of Damascus.",
      "They shot more bullets into the air in celebration than they fired in anger at Assad's loyalists, who were running for their lives.",
      "I saw hundreds of cars queuing to leave at the border with Lebanon, full of disgruntled, defeated men and frightened families.",
      "Rank and file soldiers dumped their uniforms and weapons without firing a shot and went home.",
      "The Assad regime crumpled, hollowed out by corruption, cruelty and brutal disdain for the lives of Syrians. Even Assad's own Alawite community did not fight for him.",
      "That was why on Thursday evening this week, instead of sheltering from shells and bullets on some freezing street in Homs or Hama, as I'd expected, I walked through the marble halls of the presidential palace in Damascus with Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria's de facto leader.",
      "He has given up his uniform, and swapped his wartime pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, for his real name.",
      "Many Syrians doubt his claim that he has also swapped his old jihadist beliefs for a more tolerant form of Syrian religious nationalism.",
      "It is true that he broke with al Qaeda in 2016, after a long career as a jihadist fighter in Iraq and Syria. But as I found in Assad's palace, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a tall, quietly spoken man in his early forties, is reluctant to get too specific about the Syria he wants.",
      "He comes across as highly intelligent and politically astute. Like many astute politicians, he often does not give a straight answer to a straight question.",
      "He denied he wanted Syria to become a Middle Eastern Afghanistan.",
      "Watch a longer version of Jeremy interview with al-Sharaa",

      "The Taliban, he said, ruled \"a tribal society. Syria is entirely different.\" Syria's new rulers would respect its culture and history.",
      "When I asked whether women would have the freedoms they have come to expect here, he said 60 per cent of students in universities in Idlib, his powerbase, were female.",
      "But he tried not to answer a question about mandating hijab - Islamic dress - for women.",
      "Damascus has been buzzing with rumours of bearded HTS men ordering women to cover their hair.",
      "I pointed out that there had been a big row on social media after a woman asked for a selfie with him and then pulled up her hood when the photo was taken.",
      "Conservatives criticised al-Sharaa for consenting to pose with a woman who was not part of his family. Liberals saw her hood as a dark omen of Syria's future.",

      "If he was exasperated by the question he did not show it.",
      "\"I did not force her. But it's my personal freedom. I want photos taken for me the way that suits me. I did not force her. That's not the same as having a law about it that applies countrywide. But there is a culture in this country that the law needs to recognise.\"",
      "Al-Sharaa was referring to the fact that many Syrians, not just in the majority Sunni Muslim community, are pious.",
      "Many women wear hijab. The point, secular Syrians would say, is to be able to choose.",
      "In half a century of Assad rule, Syrians developed survival strategies which often included hiding their own feelings and doing what was expected of them.",
      "Shocked, nervous, secular Syrians showed me videos on their phones of mass prayers outside universities when the students went back last Sunday.",
      "Was it, they asked, real piety or young people doing as they were told because that is how it's been here for their whole lives?",
      "It will all, al-Sharaa said, be a matter for a new constitution to be decided by a panel of legal experts.",
      "Al-Sharaa's critics will point out that as things stand, he chooses who gets on to the committee that he says will be writing new laws as well as a new constitution.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa wanted to talk most about the old regime's oppression of the people.",
      "\"The Syrian problems are far too bigger than the issues you are asking about. Half the population was kicked out of Syria or forcibly displaced from their houses.",
      "\"They were targeted with barrel bombs and unguided dumb bombs and over 250 chemical attacks. Many Syrians drowned at sea trying to escape to Europe.\"",
      "He recognised that Syria has no chance of starting to stabilise and rebuild if sanctions are not lifted.",
      "Sanctions were aimed originally at the Assad regime. To keep them, he said, meant treating the victim the same as the oppressor.",
      "He denied the group he leads is a terror organisation, which at the moment is the position of the UN and most of the world's strongest countries.",
      "Visits by foreign diplomats suggest changing both the sanctions and terrorist listings could be feasible.",
      "He was dismissive when I pointed out I knew diplomats had told him that changing that status would depend on proof he was keeping his promise to respect minority rights and run an inclusive political process.",
      "\"What matters to me is that the Syrian people believe me. We promised the Syrian people to liberate them from this criminal regime and we did that. This is what matters to me first and last.",
      "\"I don't very much care about what will be said about us abroad. I'm not obliged to prove to the world that we work seriously to achieve the interests of our people in Syria.\"",
      "During the last two weeks, I have heard many Syrians say that they want to be left alone to try to rebuild their country.",
      "That sounds like a pipe dream.",
      "The war destroyed much of the country, but it also drained away Syria's sovereignty.",
      "Bashar al-Assad became a client of Iran and Russia and fled the country when they stopped supporting him.",
      "The US is in the north-east, to hunt remnants of Islamic State and to protect its Kurdish allies.",
      "Turkey controls much of the north-west and has its own Arab-led militia.",
      "There are signs that the Turks, who have a close relationship with HTS, are preparing a renewed assault on Syrian Kurds who have a close relationship with Kurdish separatists inside Turkey.",
      "Israel, currently as aggressive as it has been for many years, has most overtly exploited the vacuum of power it saw in Syria.",
      "It continues to bomb the remains of the state's military infrastructure and taking more Syrian land to add to the Golan Heights which it has occupied since 1967.",
      "The Israelis, as ever, justify their actions as self-defence.",
      "The UN special envoy to Syria Geir Pedersen told me that Israel's actions were \"irresponsible.\" Israel, he said should not act in a manner that could \"destabilise this very, very fragile transitional process.\"",

      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's agenda is overflowing.",
      "Syria is a broken country that he says he wants to repair and revive, full of challenges that might make his task impossible.",
      "HTS is not the only armed group in Syria and there are some that want to destroy his fledgling administration. Enemies of HTS in the Islamic State network might try destabilising attacks.",
      "The desire Syrians have for vengeance against Assad's killers - and the ex-president himself - could explode into destructive public rage if HTS cannot show that it is bringing to justice the men who kept their boots on Syrian throats for so long.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, correctly, sees Syria as a fulcrum at the heart of the Middle East.",
      "\"Syria is an important country with a strategic location, very influential in the world, look how America is present in it on the one hand, Russia on the other hand and regional countries such as Turkey, Iran and Israel as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "Judges in the French city of Avignon have sentenced Dominique Pelicot to 20 years in prison for aggravated rape after he drugged and abused his then wife, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, and invited dozens of strangers to rape her.",
      "Dominique stood accused alongside 50 other men. Of the 50 co-defendants found guilty, 46 were found guilty of rape, two guilty of attempted rape, and two guilty of sexual assault.",
      "For almost a decade, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was unknowingly given sedatives by her ex-husband, who has admitted to raping her and inviting men he had recruited online to have sex with her in her bed at home while she was unconscious and unaware.",
      "Although Dominique Pelicot admitted the charges against him, most of the other men on trial denied what they did was rape.",
      "It was Gis\u00e8le's decision to waive her anonymity and throw this trial into the open - in her words, making \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist - something which has turned the 72-year-old into a feminist icon.",
      "Dominique has also been found guilty of attempted aggravated rape of the wife of one of the co-accused, Jean-Pierre Marechal - who admitted drugging and raping his own wife, Cillia, and inviting Dominique to rape her too.",
      "Marechal was found guilty of attempted rape and aggravated rape.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was further convicted of taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Aurore and Celine.",
      "\"I am a rapist,\" he previously told the judges. \"I acknowledge all the facts [of the case] in their entirety.\" He had begged his ex-wife and three children for forgiveness, but his actions have torn the Pelicot family apart.",
      "Prosecutors had asked for jail sentences for the defendants ranging from four years to 20 years, the maximum sentence for a charge of aggravated rape.",
      "One of the defendants, who has admitted the charges, previously called the trial rushed and \"botched\".",
      "Campaigners said this case proved the need for consent to be built into France's rape laws, as in other European countries.",
      "What is the case all about?",
      "From 2011 to 2020, Dominique Pelicot plied his wife with tranquilising drugs and sleeping pills without her knowledge, crushed them into powder and added them to her food and drink.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot suffered memory loss and blackouts because of the drugs and she has spoken of 10 years of her life that have been lost.",
      "He was eventually caught because a security guard reported him to police for taking photographs under women's skirts in a supermarket.",
      "\"I thought we were a close couple,\" she once told the court. Instead, her husband was going on a notorious but now banned website called Coco.fr to invite local men to their home to have sex with her while she was comatose.",
      "\"I was sacrificed on the altar of vice,\" Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said early in the trial.",

      "The average jail term for rape in France is 11.1 years, according to the French justice ministry.",
      "The other defendants come from all walks of life and most of them are from a 50km (30-mile) radius of the Pelicots' village of Mazan. The fact they are firefighters, security guards and lorry drivers has earned them the name Monsieur-Tout-Le-Monde (Mr Everyman). Most of them have children too.",

      "Therefore none of those accused has been able to challenge the allegation that they were in Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's room while she was comatose.",
      "Their defence relied on the definition of rape, because it currently involves any kind of sexual penetration \"by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise\". That means prosecutors needed to prove intent to rape.",
      "Public prosecutor Laure Chabaud told the court that no-one could say any more that \"since she didn't say anything, she gave her consent - that belongs to a bygone age\".",

    "title": "Rare accounts of life for women inside notorious Iranian prison",
    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 02:25:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Interrogations, beatings, cramped quarters and the tight bonds women forge inside Tehran's Evin prison.",
    "story": [
      "Crouched alone on the floor, in a tiny, windowless cell, Nasim could hear what sounded like other prisoners being tortured. The guard would bang on the door and say: \"Can you hear that beating? Get ready, you're next.\"",
      "She was \"interrogated for 10 to 12 hours every day\" and repeatedly threatened with execution.",
      "The bare cell, no more than two metres across, had no bed or toilet. Four months in solitary confinement was the 36-year-old hairdresser's introduction to Iran's notorious Evin prison. The only people she saw were her interrogators. She thought that she would \"die and no-one would know\".",
      "We have pieced together accounts from multiple reliable sources to build a picture of everyday life for Nasim and other women, who are currently being held in Evin prison.",
      "Many were among the tens of thousands of people arrested in connection with the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" protests that followed the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Mahsa had been arrested for allegedly breaking Iranian laws that require women to wear the hijab and she died in police custody.",
      "While people have spoken about conditions in Evin after they have been released, it is rare to get details of inmates' lives while they are still inside.",
      "What we have heard reveals not only brutality, but a place of complex contrasts where the prisoners continue to campaign for women's rights and defiantly challenge restrictions imposed on them. There are surprising moments too - one inmate, occasionally allowed time alone with her husband, has even got pregnant.",
      "Nasim - who loves rap music and make-up - was taken into custody in April 2023 after joining protests with her friends, one of whom was killed in the government crackdown. She survived interrogations \"by thinking about those who died on the street\". People who saw Nasim when she came out of solitary confinement have described cuts and bruises on her body and how she was tortured to make false confessions.",
      "Rezvaneh was also arrested following the protests, along with her husband, in 2023. They both ended up in Evin, which has separate sections for men and women. Her interrogators said they would kill her husband and \"hit him so much that he would turn black like coal, and purple like an aubergine\".",
      "After solitary confinement, interrogations and humiliation, Nasim was moved to the women's wing, that houses about 70 people, including Rezvaneh, most of whom were arrested on political charges.",
      "It is where the British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcilffe, who was allowed to return to the UK in 2022, spent nearly four years of her sentence.",
      "Most of the women there have been sentenced because of their activism, for offences including spreading propaganda, drawing arms against the regime, and endangering national security.",
      "They live in four crowded cells with up to 20 people in each one and bunk beds stacked three-high.",
      "Living together in cramped quarters often causes friction, and sometimes fights - both physical and verbal - break out. But the women also forge tight bonds.",
      "In winter, \"everyone is freezing\" and the women \"walk around with hot water bottles\" to stay warm. In summer, they swelter in the heat.",
      "There is a small kitchen area with a couple of hobs where - if they have enough money to buy food from the prison shop - they can cook for themselves to supplement the basic prison meals that are brought to their cells.",
      "A dark, dirty area at the end of a corridor serves as a place to smoke. A small cemented yard with a little area for plants and a volleyball net provides a bit of outside space.",
      "They can wear their own clothes and are free to move around their living quarters which have two bathrooms. Every evening, they queue to use the toilet and brush their teeth.",
      "It was here, after she had been in prison for about four months, that Rezvaneh found out she was pregnant.",
      "She had struggled with infertility for years and had given up on ever having a baby. But according to Evin's rules, she and her husband - who is still a prisoner in the men's wing - were occasionally allowed to meet in private and, on one of these occasions, she conceived.",
      "When she realised she was pregnant she \"cried for several days\".",
      "She found \"the worst thing was the mental pressure and tensions inside the prison\". Finding a quiet place in the crowded cells, where people spend most of their days sitting on their beds, was a constant challenge.",
      "The prison food left her craving apple juice, bread, and meat, which were hard to get hold of. When she could get some meat from the prison shop it was at least twice the price of meat on the outside.",
      "The prison eventually allowed her to have an ultrasound scan at four months, and doctors told her she was having a girl.",
      "As she listened to \"each heartbeat the sense of hope became stronger\". But she was afraid that the conditions in prison would endanger the baby's health. Rezvaneh was not just concerned about her diet - she has epilepsy and needed to avoid stress. Prison doctors told her she had a high risk of miscarriage.",
      "Vida, a journalist, loves to paint. She uses bedsheets for canvases and paints portraits of the other women.",
      "One, which was smuggled out of Evin, is of Kurdish prisoner Pakhshan Azizi who travelled to Kurdish areas of Iraq and Syria to help victims of the Islamic State group. Pakhshan has been sentenced to death, following charges of using arms to fight the Iranian regime, and there is great concern this sentence could be carried out soon.",
      "Vida has been warned not to draw anything with a hidden meaning. On one of the walls in the yard she painted crumbling bricks with a green forest behind them. The authorities sprayed over it.",
      "In a corridor she painted a picture of an Iranian cheetah running. Some of the women \"kept saying how much good energy they got from it\". But one night the authorities \"went and painted over it\" and restricted Vida's access to painting supplies.",
      "One of her murals has been left intact though - huge, blue ocean waves on the walls of the corridor where the women go to smoke.",
      "Getting medical care has been a constant battle for the women. One of the inmates, human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, has life-threatening heart and lung conditions.",
      "But in prison she has had to fight long and hard for access to a doctor. Relatives said that officials repeatedly blocked treatment because she refused to wear a headscarf to a medical appointment. The authorities only relented after fellow prisoners went on hunger strike for two weeks. Narges was released for 21 days at the start of December on medical grounds.",
      "Behind bars, she and the others have carried out protests, pushing the boundaries and continuing to fight for their rights. Although the law requires them to wear headscarves, many refuse. And after a long fight with the authorities, the women were allowed curtains around the beds so they could have some privacy, out of view of CCTV cameras.",
      "One of the toughest things for the women is waiting to hear their sentences. Nasim's interrogators had threatened her with the death penalty and she had to wait nearly 500 days to find out her fate.",
      "She found solace in her fellow prisoners - who she has described as sisters who give her life and act as \"a balm on the wounds\" of her wings.",
      "Every morning, one of her friends pulls aside the bed curtain and makes her get up for breakfast.",
      "\"Each day we think of something to do, so by the end of the day we can tell ourselves, 'We lived today,'\" one of our sources explains.",
      "Others spend their time reading poetry, singing, playing homemade card games and watching TV - there are two televisions where they can watch Iranian channels showing drama, documentaries and football.",
      "It is these small things that kept Nasim going while she waited for her sentence, under the constant threat of execution. When the sentence finally came, she was given six years in prison, 74 lashes and 20 years in exile in a small town far from Tehran. She had been charged with distributing propaganda and drawing arms against the Islamic Republic.",
      "Despite the severity of the sentence, Nasim felt she could breathe again, and embrace the life she thought she had lost.",
      "Three other women in the wing have been sentenced to death for drawing arms against the regime or affiliation to armed groups. However one of them has had her sentence overturned.",
      "More than 800 people were executed in Iran last year - the highest number in eight years, according to Amnesty International. Most were for crimes involving violence and drugs. A handful were women.",
      "So every Tuesday, the women protest against executions, chanting in the prison yard, refusing to move all night and staging hunger strikes. The campaign has spread through jails across Iran, gaining international support. On the anniversary of Mahsa Amini's death the women in Evin burned headscarves.",
      "There have been repercussions - sometimes the guards raid their cells and women have been beaten and injured. They can also be taken for further interrogations, put back in solitary confinement or have phone calls and visits blocked. Most of the guards are women and \"sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are cruel and hard-hearted, depending on what orders they receive from a higher authority\", says one of our sources.",
      "The Iranian government routinely denies allegations of human rights violations, saying conditions inside Evin prison meet all necessary standards and prisoners are not mistreated.",
      "As Rezvaneh's due date approached, the prison authorities allowed her to temporarily leave prison for the birth. In October, she had a baby girl.",
      "But her joy and relief at the safe arrival of her daughter is mingled with fear, sadness and anger. Her husband was not allowed out of prison with her, although she has been able to take their daughter to visit him in Evin.",
      "And because of the stress, Rezvaneh has struggled to produce breastmilk. She is expecting to be recalled to Evin prison soon with her baby daughter to serve the rest of her five-year sentence - if she's not granted an early release, that could be nearly four years.",
      "Babies are usually allowed to stay with their mothers in jail until the age of two. After that they are often sent to a close relative, or if that is not possible, they might be placed in a children's home.",
      "But rather than stop the inmates, one prisoner has said the challenges they face have made her  \"braver and stronger,\" supporting their belief that \"the future is clear: to fight, even in prison\".",

    "title": "United Front: China's 'magic weapon' caught in a spy controversy",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 22:15:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The UFWD is a decades-old - and increasingly controversial - arm of China's Communist Party. What does it do?",
    "story": [
      "The People's Republic of China has a \"magic weapon\", according to its founding leader Mao Zedong and its current president Xi Jinping.",
      "It is called the United Front Work Department - and it is raising as much alarm in the West as Beijing's growing military arsenal.",
      "Yang Tengbo, a prominent businessman who has been linked to Prince Andrew, is the latest overseas Chinese citizen to be scrutinised - and sanctioned - for his links to the UFWD.",
      "The existence of the department is far from a secret. A decades-old and well-documented arm of the Chinese Communist Party, it has been mired in controversy before. Investigators from the US to Australia have cited the UFWD in multiple espionage cases, often accusing Beijing of using it for foreign interference.",
      "Beijing has denied all espionage allegations, calling them ludicrous.",
      "So what is the UFWD and what does it do?",
      "'Controlling China's message'",
      "The United Front - originally referring to a broad communist alliance - was once hailed by Mao as the key to the Communist Party's triumph in the decades-long Chinese Civil War.",
      "After the war ended in 1949 and the party began ruling China, United Front activities took a backseat to other priorities. But in the last decade under Xi, the United Front has seen a renaissance of sorts.",
      "Xi's version of the United Front is broadly consistent with earlier incarnations: to \"build the broadest possible coalition with all social forces that are relevant\", according to Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.",
      "On the face of it, the UFWD is not shadowy - it even has a website and reports many of its activities on it. But the extent of its work - and its reach - is less clear.",
      "While a large part of that work is domestic, Dr Ohlberg said, \"a key target that has been defined for United Front work is overseas Chinese\".",
      "Today, the UFWD seeks to influence public discussions about sensitive issues ranging from Taiwan - which China claims as its territory - to  the suppression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang.",
      "It also tries to shape narratives about China in foreign media, target Chinese government critics abroad and co-opt influential overseas Chinese figures.",
      "\"United Front work can include espionage but [it] is broader than espionage,\" Audrye Wong, assistant professor of politics at the University of Southern California, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Beyond the act of acquiring covert information from a foreign government, United Front activities centre on the broader mobilisation of overseas Chinese,\" she said, adding that China is \"unique in the scale and scope\" of such influence activities.",
      "China has always had the ambition for such influence, but its rise in recent decades has given Beijing the ability to exercise it.",
      "Since Xi became president in 2012, he has been especially proactive in crafting China's message to the world, enouraging a confrontational \"wolf warrior\" approach to diplomacy and urging his country's diaspora to \"tell China's story well\".",
      "The UFWD operates through various overseas Chinese community organisations, which have vigorously defended the Communist Party beyond its shores. They have censored anti-CCP artwork and protested at the activities of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. The UFWD has also been linked to threats against members of persecuted minorities abroad, such as Tibetans and Uyghurs.",
      "But much of the UFWD's work overlaps with other party agencies, operating under what observers have described as \"plausible deniability\".",
      "It is this murkiness that is causing so much suspicion and apprehension about the UFWD.",
      "When Yang appealed against his ban, judges agreed with the then secretary of state's report that Yang \"represented a risk to national security\" - citing the fact that he downplayed his ties with the UFWD as one of the reasons that led them to that conclusion.",
      "Yang, however, maintains that he has not done anything unlawful and that the spy allegations are \"entirely untrue\".",
      "Cases like Yang's are becoming increasingly common. In 2022, British Chinese lawyer Christine Lee was accused by the MI5 of acting through the UFWD to cultivate relationships with influential people in the UK. The following year, Liang Litang, a US citizen who ran a Chinese restaurant in Boston, was indicted for providing information about Chinese dissidents in the area to his contacts in the UFWD.",
      "And in September, Linda Sun, a former aide in the New York governor's office, was charged with using her position to serve Chinese government interests - receiving benefits, including travel, in return. According to Chinese state media reports, she had met a top UFWD official in 2017, who told her to \"be an ambassador of Sino-American friendship\".",
      "It is not uncommon for prominent and successful Chinese people to be associated with the party, whose approval they often need, especially in the business world.",
      "But where is the line between peddling influence and espionage?",
      "\"The boundary between influence and espionage is blurry\" when it comes to Beijing's operations, said Ho-fung Hung, a politics professor at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Yang Tengbo: Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew?",
      "Spy allegations pose dilemma for UK's China policy",
      "This ambiguity has intensified after China passed a law in 2017 mandating Chinese nationals and companies to co-operate with intelligence probes, including sharing information with the Chinese government - a move that Dr Hung said \"effectively turns everyone into potential spies\".",
      "The Ministry of State Security has released dramatic propaganda videos warning the public that foreign spies are everywhere and \"they are cunning and sneaky \".",
      "Some students who were sent on special trips abroad were told by their universities to limit contact with foreigners and were asked for a report of their activities on their return.",
      "And yet Xi is keen to promote China to the world. So he has tasked a trusted arm of the party to project strength abroad.",
      "And that is becoming a challenge for Western powers - how do they balance doing business with the world's second-largest economy alongside serious security concerns?",
      "Wrestling with the long arm of Beijing",
      "Genuine fears over China's overseas influence are playing into more hawkish sentiments in the West, often leaving governments in a dilemma.",
      "Some, like Australia, have tried to protect themselves with fresh foreign interference laws that criminalise individuals deemed to be meddling in domestic affairs. In 2020, the US imposed visa restrictions on people seen as active in UFWD activities.",
      "An irked Beijing has warned that such laws - and the prosecutions they have spurred - hinder bilateral relations.",
      "\"The so-called allegations of Chinese espionage are utterly absurd,\" a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question about Yang. \"The development of China-UK relations serves the common interests of both countries.\"",
      "Some experts say that the long arm of China's United Front is indeed concerning.",
      "\"Western governments now need to be less naive about China's United Front work and take it as a serious threat not only to national security but also to the safety and freedom of many ethnic Chinese citizens,\" Dr Hung says.",
      "But, he adds, \"governments also need to be vigilant against anti-Chinese racism and work hard to build trust and co-operation with ethnic Chinese communities in countering the threat together.\"",
      "Last December, Di Sanh Duong, a Vietnam-born ethnic Chinese community leader in Australia, was convicted of planning foreign interference for trying to cosy up to an Australian minister. Prosecutors argued that he was an \"ideal target\" for the UFWD because he had run for office in the 1990s and boasted ties with Chinese officials.",
      "Duong's trial had centred around what he meant when he said the inclusion of the minister at a charity event would be beneficial to \"us Chinese\" - did he mean the Chinese community in Australia, or mainland China?",
      "In the end, Duong's conviction - and a prison sentence - raised serious concerns that such broad anti-espionage laws and prosecutions can easily become weapons for targeting ethnic Chinese people.",
      "\"It's important to remember that not everyone who is ethnically Chinese is a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party. And not everyone who is involved in these diaspora organisations is driven by fervent loyalty to China,\" Dr Wong says.",
      "\"Overly aggressive policies based on racial profiling will only legitimise the Chinese government's propaganda that ethnic Chinese are not welcome and end up pushing diaspora communities further into Beijing's arms.\"",
      "What is behind Starmer's meeting with China's president?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "A cartoon cat has been vexing China\u2019s censors \u2013 now he says they are on his tail"

      "\"They kept us goin,'\" Weir said.",
      "Grateful Dead forms",
      "The band formed in the San Francisco Bay area in the mid 1960s. Weir was 16 when he first heard Jerry Garcia playing banjo outside a music shop in Palo Alto.",
      "\"It was New Year's Eve, basically he invited us in. We had enough fun that evening that we decided it was too much fun to walk away from,\" Weir said.",
      "Kreutzmann recalled seeing Garcia and Weir play at a club.",
      "\"I was totally blown away by Jerry's ability to hold the audience in his hands. Jerry held the light for everybody,\" he said. \"That week he called me and said, 'Hey, you wanna be in a band?' I said, 'Sure.'\"",
      "Kreutzmann later brought Hart into the band in 1967.",
      "\"Bill invited me to play and sit in. When I heard the band, I go, 'Whoa.' We all got turned on to the Grateful Dead in different ways, but we really got turned on to it,\" Hart said. \"We got bit.\"",

      "Grateful Dead's legacy",
      "In their 30 years as a band, the Grateful Dead scored just one Top 40 hit with \"Touch of Grey,\" and not a single Grammy nomination.",
      "\"We've had people come up to us, say, 'You guys are never gonna make it. You play too long. You play too loud,'\" Kreutzmann recalled.",
      "But through their decades together, they built a legion of followers known as \"Deadheads,\" who started recording and sharing their concerts.",
      "\"You'd look from the stage and it looked like a forest of trees of microphones,\" Kreutzmann said of their fans recording their concerts.",
      "Their record company advised against allowing fans to record, but the band refused, saying they weren't worried about piracy.",
      "\"It was the smartest thing we ever did,\" Kreutzmann said.",
      "The Grateful Dead played more than 2,300 concerts and fans recorded most of them.",
      "\"Those cassettes went out all over the world,\" Hart said. \"They were our archivists as well.\"",

I want you to meet this song.' \u2026 What that dream did was, it solidified in me the notion that, yes when we play the songs, they're living things,\" Weir said. \"They come and visit our world and they come through us.\"",

      "The petition filed by the hip-hop star in Los Angeles Superior Court asks the judge to prevent the Canadian rapper Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, from using third parties to continue the same online harassment of Megan, whose legal name is Megan Pete, that he engaged in and encouraged before his imprisonment.",
      "\"Even now, while behind bars, Mr. Peterson shows no signs of stopping,\" the petition says. \"Despite being sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Ms. Pete, Mr. Peterson continues to to subject her to repeated trauma and revictimization.\"",
      "An email from The Associated Press seeking comment from Lanez's lawyers was not immediately returned. A court hearing on the order is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "The filing says bloggers acting on Lanez's behalf continue to cast doubt on her allegations, making false claims including that the gun and bullet fragments in the case are missing. It also comes after Pete\u00a0filed a lawsuit in October against blogger Milagro Gramz, accusing Gramz of purposely spreading false information on behalf of Lanez.",
      "That lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida against Gramz, a popular content creator who is legally known as Milagro Elizabeth Cooper. The lawsuit accuses Cooper of intentionally causing Pete emotional distress by cyberstalking, promoting and sharing deepfake pornography of Pete and questioning if she was actually shot.",

      "Megan testified during the trial that in July 2020, after they left a party at Kylie Jenner's Hollywood Hills home, Lanez fired the gun at the back of her feet and shouted for her to dance as she walked away from an SUV in which they had been riding. She revealed who had fired the gun only months later.",
      "The case created a firestorm in the hip-hop community, churning up issues including the reluctance of Black victims to speak to police, gender politics in hip-hop, online toxicity, protecting Black women and the ramifications of misogynoir, a particular brand of misogyny Black women experience.",

      "\"American Me\" (1992)",
      "In his first film as director, Edward James Olmos stars as a prison gang leader who, upon his release, tries to maintain his hold on criminal organizations and drug trafficking in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",
      "Once the Hays Office decided in the early 1930s that movies had become too violent and licentious, bad guys either had to make good for their crimes, or pay the ultimate price. No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",
      "\"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (a.k.a. \"Serpentine Dance \u2013 Annabelle\") (1895)",
      "This early Edison short film captures dancer Annabelle Moore maneuvering fabric-wings. Several versions of the film were released, including some with color tints.",
      "\"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984)",
      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",
      "\"Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt\" (1989)",
      "The origin of the NAMES Project Aids Memorial Quilt \u2014 a tapestry of stories memorializing those who died from HIV/AIDS, as well as a society that had failed them \u2014 is told in this Oscar-winning feature documentary, directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, that also earned a Peabody Award.",
      "\"Compensation\" (1999)",
      "The debut feature of director Zeinabu irene Davis tells two parallel love stories, set nearly a century apart, each involving a deaf woman and a hearing man diagnosed with a fatal disease. Michelle A. Banks (who is herself deaf) and John Earl Jelks play both couples, and their stories are illustrated with title cards and American Sign Language.",
      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze starred in the hit romance that earned the Jennifer Warnes-Bill Medley song \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" an Oscar and a Grammy.",
      "\"Ganja and Hess\" (1973)",
      "Duane Jones, who played the lead in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" stars in this horror story in which an anthropologist studying ancient African cultures becomes a vampire. A low-budget tale that served as a metaphor for drug addiction, \"Ganja and Hess\" was directed by writer and playwright Bill Gunn, and was later remade by Spike Lee as \"Da Sweet Blood of Jesus.\"",
      "\"Invaders from Mars\" (1953)",
      "When little David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) wakes up in the middle of the night and witnesses a spaceship landing nearby, he tries to convince his dad it was real. But when dad returns from investigating the landing site, there's something not quite right about him. And then, a similar change comes over his mother. What are those strange marks on the back of their necks? What's poor little David to do? Fifties paranoia blends with stylish photography, cool-looking sets, and ridiculous Martian costumes in this nostalgic sci-fi tale directed by William Cameron Menzies.",
      "\"KoKo's Earth Control\" (1928)",
      "A wild addition to the genre of apocalyptic cinema, this silent cartoon by Max and Dave Fleischer features Koko the Clown and his naughty dog Fitz, visiting the place that runs our planet's weather. Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",
      "\"My Family/Mi familia\" (1995)",
      "Directed by Gregory Nava (\"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez\"), this emotional and tearful multi-generational story of Mexican immigrants settling in East Los Angeles stars Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Elpidia Carrillo and Enrique Castillo.",
      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents. Starring Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as mom-and-pop spies, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as their budding young agents, the film was a hit, spawning a franchise (including a 3-D entry starring Sylvester Stallone).",
      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",
      "Cinematographer Jessie Maple directed this, the first independent feature helmed by an African American woman, in which a former athlete and coach (played by Obaka Adedunyo) struggles to overcome drug addiction.",
      "Zora Lathan Student Films (1975-1976)",
      "The democratic nature of the National Film Registry allows for the preservation of Hollywood studio features, independent films, industrial and advertising shorts, student films, and newsreels. The Registry has also preserved home movies, which capture American life in unfiltered and wholly revealing ways.\u00a0 During her years as a film student in Chicago, Adaora \"Zora\" Lathan shot six short 16mm films documenting her family members \u2014 whimsical vignettes which she characterized as \"artworks.\"",

      "When King asked what was going through her mind before stepping on stage, Jackson responded, \"I was just like, 'Wow, this is really gonna happen.' And I was going through my lines.\"",
      "Childhood dream",
      "In her memoir \"Lovely One,\" Jackson revealed her lifelong love for theater and shared her aspiration to become the first Supreme Court Justice to perform on Broadway.",
      "\"I just always loved theater. And I felt very comfortable on stage. You know, I was always performing from when I was really young. It just felt like the theater people were my people,\" Jackson said during an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" at the Civilian Hotel in New York just before her first rehearsal.",
      "\"My best friend was a girl named Sunny Schleifer, and the two of us would make up skits and dress up and do all of these things. When I got into high school, I did speech and debate. I had these two different loves, the law and theater,\" she said.",
      "Jackson's Broadway debut included two scenes written specifically for her in \"& Juliet,\" a musical that celebrates female empowerment and controlling one's own destiny. \"It's a wonderful message and obviously very fun,\" Jackson said.",
      "Before stepping onto the Broadway stage, Jackson participated in table reads, scene walkthroughs and vocal sessions, preparing for the performance.",
      "Reflecting on her early days as an aspiring actor, Jackson recalled a drama class at Harvard where she acted alongside a classmate who would later become famous: Matt Damon. \"We just were in a drama class together,\" Jackson said. \"I memorized my lines, and I'm ready to go and it's over and the professor says, 'Ketanji, you did such a good job. Matt, we'll talk.'\"",
      "She even debated between her two loves and which path she should pursue.",
      "\"I mean, there were times when I considered doing acting. I'd always wanted to be a lawyer, but I thought, 'Well, maybe I'm pretty good at this,'\" she said.",
      "Jackson reflected on the experience after her performance, \"I think the lesson is: don't give up and don't be deterred, that you can do it. And again, that anything is possible.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:56:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree, reflects on his groundbreaking career, the impact of family and his lasting legacy in film.",
    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "title": "Maggie Rogers on her long-form music: \"I've always loved art that takes time\"",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:07:40 -0500",
    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",

      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",

Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "title": "How a U.S. government shutdown could have impacted benefits and services",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:59:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. government faced the threat of a shutdown if Congress didn't pass a spending bill before Dec. 21, 2024. Here's a look at the potential impact.",
    "story": [
      "Update, 12:45 a.m. Saturday:\u00a0The U.S. government avoided a prolonged government shutdown after the Senate approved a\u00a0funding bill\u00a0in the early morning hours Saturday, sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature. The Senate approval came after the House on Friday night overwhelmingly approved the measure as well, just ahead of the midnight deadline.",
      "As the fight over a federal spending bill went down to the wire, the U.S. faced a looming deadline for a government shutdown that could have began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. That raised questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted if funding lapsed just days before the holidays.",
      "The threat of a shutdown stemmed from controversy over a spending bill that would have extended funding through March 14, but which fell apart after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill. A revised version also failed on Thursday before another attempt on Friday passed in the House.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Could a shutdown hurt the U.S. economy?",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers, among other impacts, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "\"A government shutdown could leave a visible mark on the economy,\" he wrote. \"Apart from the direct macroeconomic consequences of a shutdown, financial markets and private sector confidence could also be affected.\"",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The vote came down to the wire, as the Senate looked to wrap up its current session. Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order late Friday night that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",

      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",

      "Starbucks said the union wants to increase the minimum wage for hourly workers by 64% immediately and 77% over the life of a three-year contract.",

    "summary": "More than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019, according to AAA.",
    "story": [
      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S., as the House appeared to have averted a government shutdown late Friday.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \"continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\" spokesperson Diaz said. \"Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\"",
      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

    "story": [
      "Update, 6:43 p.m.:\u00a0The U.S. government looked poised to avoid a prolonged government shutdown after the House of Representatives on Friday voted to approve a\u00a0funding bill\u00a0just\u00a0hours before a midnight deadline. The bill is expected to pass in the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",
      "Air traffic controllers are also deemed essential employees and would be expected to work while foregoing a paycheck. Employees would be paid after a shutdown were to end.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group representing the industry, on Friday said a government shutdown could cost the sector $1 billion per week given that disruptions would occur during a peak travel period.",
      "\"A prolonged government shutdown threatens holiday travel disruptions that Americans won't tolerate,\" Geoff Freeman, the group's CEO, said in a statement. \"It's hard to see how anyone in Congress wins if they force TSA workers, air traffic controllers and other essential employees to work without pay during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.\"",
      "A survey by the group also found that 60% of Americans said they would consider changing their travel plans if a government shutdown occurs, including canceling flights and trips altogether, resulting in significant economic losses for travel-related businesses.",
      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",
      "In the event of a shutdown, the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the U.S. would be expected to show up to work without pay.",
      "What would a government shutdown mean for passport processing?",
      "According to the State Department's contingency plan, consular operations will continue as normal \"so long as there are sufficient fees to support operation,\" given that they are integral to national security. That includes passport and visa services.",
      "Still, some passport services could be limited, if they are located in buildings run by another agency that is inoperational.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 17:20:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what's driving up home heating costs, and how much families are expected to spend this winter.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to spend more money heating their homes this winter than on holiday gifts, according to new research.",
      "The elevated cost of staying warm indoors amid cold outdoor temperatures comes after an unusually hot summer, that led to households spending bigger shares of their budgets on cooling costs, compared with previous years, according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

      "Who will get a payment from the IRS?",
      "The tax agency said it's disbursing the funds after reviewing internal data that showed many people had filed tax returns but yet didn't claim what is known as the \"recovery rebate credit\" in 2021.",
      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",

Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",

      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",

    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

      "Legislation to expand Social Security benefits to millions of Americans cleared two procedural hurdles in the U.S. Senate this week, and is now headed toward possible passage on Friday, with the clock ticking and only days left in the current session of Congress.",
      "Senators on Wednesday voted 73-27 to approve a motion to move forward with consideration of the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, and then on Thursday voted 73-23 to proceed to the bill, with both tallies clearing the 60-vote fillibuster threshold. Only a simple majority is needed for final passage in the Senate in order to pass the bill to President Biden's desk.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure on Wednesday. Vance and fellow Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, along with Joe Manchin, an independent and outgoing senator from West Virginia, did not participate in Thursday's vote.",
      "The Senate was scheduled to reconvene on Friday, and is expected to resume consideration of the measure after votes related to confirming two judges to serve in California.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Wednesday. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican relayed having a retired teacher cry in his office, \"not understanding why she was getting less in Social Security spousal benefits than if she had never worked at all.\"",

      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "\"This stuff takes time, but 21 years is ridiculous,\" said Brown of the process. The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said last week, the Associated Press reported.",
      "That said, Braun did vote to proceed with the legislation on Wednesday.",
      "\"In the end it's going to come down to individual members are going to make their own decisions about where they want to come down on that,\" incoming Republican leader John Thune said at a press conference Tuesday. \"Obviously I am concerned about the long-term solvency of Social Security and that is an issue I think we need to address.\"",
      "Thune, who represents South Dakota, opposed Wednesday's motion to proceed.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:17:31 -0500",
    "summary": "House-hunters may want to zero in on these hot housing markets next year, according to the National Association of Realtors.",
    "story": [
      "Although 2024 is winding down, the U.S. housing crisis\u00a0lives on. But even as steep home prices and elevated mortgage rates sideline many would-be homebuyers, some real estate markets around the country continue to attract them.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) this month released a list of 10 local housing markets it expects to be hot spots in 2025, outperforming the rest of the country in sales. The locations have been chosen by NAR based on their current individual strengths across 10 key economic, demographic and housing factors that are considered predictors of future market activity.",
      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Mr. Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Mr. Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Mr. Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through the PSLF.",
      "\"From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 13:52:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about Frontier's \"GoWild!\" unlimited flight deal, an \"all you can fly\" offer that costs $499.",
    "story": [
      "Frontier Airlines has announced\u00a0an \"all you can fly\" pass for 2025-2026, with the $499 \"GoWild!\" deal including a year's worth of unlimited flights \u2014 with some restrictions.",
      "To be eligible, pass holders must be U.S. residents and members of Frontier Miles, the airline's loyalty program, before they purchase the annual membership. If they're not members, they'll automatically be enrolled.",
      "The pass had been available for $299 for a limited window, which expired yesterday. At $499, it's still discounted from its typical price of $699.",
      "\"The GoWild! Pass is perfect for spontaneous adventurers, budget-savvy travelers and anyone dreaming of limitless journeys,\" Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement. \"At $299, this is the lowest price we've ever offered, making it easier than ever to explore amazing destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Mexico and Latin America. This limited-time pricing will only be offered to those who act fast!\"",
      "Here's how the \"Go Wild!\" pass works",
      "Once you purchase the deal, you can book tickets on select Frontier flights for just a penny.",
      "The airline warns that not every flight operated by Frontier is available for booking through the GoWild! pass. Additionally, pass holders must pay any taxes and fees associated with the airfare.",
      "What kind of seat do you get?",
      "GoWild! pass holders cannot reserve seats in advance, nor do their fares include carry-on or checked baggage, although these extras may be purchased separately.",
      "That means customers could end up spending $15 or so on just one flight, after buying the pass. Experts say this is one drawback of the deal, given that Frontier often offers deals as low as $19, which are available to customers who aren't pass holders.",
      "When can I book flights?",
      "The unlimited pass allows travelers to make reservations the day before a flight's departure for domestic travel, and ten days before an international flight's departure date.",
      "The pass is valid for travel between May 1, 2025, and April 30, 2026, Frontier said.",
      "These restrictions could deter some fliers from purchasing the all-you-can-fly pass.",
      "\"For a certain subset of traveler, this to be really good value,\" said Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com. \"I think of the 22-year-old who just graduated, is a remote worker and might be able to get really good value out of this.\"",
      "For others, not being able to book seats on planes ahead on one's trip might be a deal breaker.",
      "There are also certain blackout dates around holidays and other busy travel periods, during which the GoWild! Pass cannot be redeemed for a plane ticket. Additionally, pass holders cannot purchase tickets on behalf of other travelers.",
      "The pass automatically renews for a fee of $699, according to the airline.",
      "Frontier first offered the annual pass in 2022, which was valid for travel in 2023. Low-cost carriers have struggled to attract customers of late, as fliers increasingly turn to premium travel offerings, and even legacy carriers introduce new, bare-bones ticket options to compete for budget-conscious customers.",

      "\"It's really the launch on TikTok, Instagram and other social media platforms that allow these characters or animals to blow up like crazy,\" said Richard Derr, who has owned a Learning Express Toys franchise in Lake Zurich, Ill., for nearly 30 years and is also a regional manager for the specialty toy store chain.",

      "Consumers are seeking out increasingly exotic species that they see in online videos, games and movies.

      "\"You never know exactly when they're going to hit and how big they're going to be,\" said Sharon Price John, the president and CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop, a chain of nearly 500 stores that offers an expanding menagerie of animals and characters for customers to customize, including capybaras and axolotls.",
      "The St. Louis-based company watches social media and gets ideas from talking to store employees and patrons, John said. It usually takes Build-A-Bear up to a year to introduce a new stuffed toy, she said, but the company can move faster if it spots a trend. It sometimes tests a small batch online to make sure a trend is sticking, John said.",
      "Annual trade shows in Asia, Germany and elsewhere are another place to spot new trends. Punirunes \u2013 digital, interactive pets that also come in plush varieties \u2013 are big in Japan right now and will likely take off in the U.S., toy store owner Derr said.",
      "\"Here, I can't give them away. They're too new. But give it a year or two,\" he said.",

      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",

      "The CPSC recently warned against FLIKRFIRE Tabletop Fireplaces and announced the recall of Colsen-branded firepits after a series of alarming incidents left 19 people with burn injuries, with some requiring surgery and others permanently disfigured.",
      "Fire pits that require pouring isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or other liquid fuel into an open container or bowl and then ignite the pooled liquid in the same location in which it was poured violate voluntary safety requirements.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:10:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday moved to lower its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points, but said it plans fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday\u00a0announced\u00a0its third consecutive interest rate cut of 2024, reducing its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. Yet in a blow for borrowers, the central bank also projected that it will loosen rates less next year than previously expected.",
      "The Fed lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its previous target range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The decision comes after policymakers slashed rates by\u00a00.5 percentage points in September, followed by a\u00a00.25 percentage point drop\u00a0in November.",
      "The Fed has now trimmed rates by 1 percentage point since September, offering relief to Americans carrying credit card balances and other debt.",
      "Fewer rate cuts in 2025",
      "At the same time, the Fed is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections. The central bank is now projecting that the federal funds rate may sit at median level of 3.9% by the end of 2025, up from its earlier forecast of 3.4%.",
      "The Fed is also projecting inflation could be higher in 2025, at 2.5%, than it had expected in September, when it forecast that price increases would slow to 2.1% next year.",
      "Wall Street tumbled in Wednesday afternoon trading, with the S&P 500 closing down 178 points, or 2.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 1,123 points, 2.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell even more sharply on the day, sliding 716 points, 3.6%.",
      "\"The market is forward-looking and ignored the good news of today's rate cut and instead focused on the paucity of rate cuts for next year,\" noted Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an email. \"[T]he market was underwhelmed by the likely future path of interest rates.\"",
      "Speaking in a Wednesday press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that progress in driving inflation down to the central bank's goal of a 2% annual rate has been slower than expected, with consumer prices in November rising\u00a02.7% on a yearly basis, fueled by elevated housing and food costs.",
      "\"I would say today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call\" to cut rates, Powell said about Wednesday's rate cut. \"The slower pace of cuts for next year reflects the higher inflation readings we've had this year.\"",
      "The Fed might opt to skip a rate cut in January, while resuming easing at its March meeting, said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email.",
      "\"While the Fed opted to round out the year with a third consecutive cut, its New Year's resolution appears to be for a more gradual pace of easing,\" Watson said.",
      "New monetary policy phase",
      "The rate cut, which was expected, was the \"least important component\" of today's Fed meeting, noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email. Instead, Wall Street was focused on the Fed's forecasts for 2025 and beyond, with the central bank's new forecasts signaling the Fed has entered \"a new phase of monetary policy, the pause phase,\" McIntyre added.",
      "Wednesday's move marks the Fed's final interest rate decision prior to President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While price increases have cooled from their June 2022 peak, opening the door to Fed rate cuts this year, inflation has remained sticky and well above the Fed's 2% annual target.",
      "Given that inflation has been sticky this year, many analysts have predicted that the Fed was likely to make fewer rate cuts in 2025 amid concerns that could cause the economy to overheat.",
      "Still, the Fed has so far defied forecasters' warnings that its rate hikes could trigger a recession.",
      "The Fed's first rate meeting of 2025 is scheduled for Jan. 28-29, or after Trump's inauguration. About eight in 10 economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at that meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Powell's bullish economic outlook",
      "While Powell said that the slow progress in grinding down inflation has been \"a bit frustrating,\" he also sounded an optimistic note about the U.S. economy, stressing that the nation's growth has far outpaced that of other developed economies.",
      "\"It's pretty clear we've avoided a recession \u2014 growth this year has been solid,\" Powell said. \"Again, the U.S. economy has just been remarkable,\" while other countries have contended with slow growth and \"struggles with inflation.\"",
      "He added, \"I expect another good year next year.\"",
      "As far as Trump's stated plans to enact broad-based tariffs, which many economists forecast could prove inflationary, if enacted, Powell said the Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is examining the potential impact from tariffs, but it will be \"quite some time\" until there are policies put into place by the second Trump administration for the central bank to examine, Powell added.",
      "\"We just don't know very much at all about the actual policies \u2014 we don't know how much will be tariffed, from which countries,\" he noted. \"We don't know if there will be retaliatory tariffs.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 17:07:18 -0500",
    "summary": "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" said an 84-year-old woman whose late husband's Social Security benefits were slashed. \"It's not fair.\"",
    "story": [
      "At 84 years old, Evelyn Paternostro spends her days working part time as a cashier at Dollar Tree. For decades, she dedicated her life to education, serving as a teacher and principal in Louisiana. But despite years of her public service, she now struggles to make ends meet.",
      "\"People at the store ask me all the time, 'Are you doing this for fun? Why aren't you retired?'\" she said. \"Because I need to eat.\"",
      "After her husband died, Paternostro discovered she couldn't collect his Social Security benefits due to a pair of federal policies called the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset.",
      "These provisions reduce or eliminate Social Security\u00a0benefits\u00a0for millions of Americans if they receive a public pension that didn't withhold Social Security tax. Retired teachers, firefighters and other public servants are some of the most impacted.",
      "\"I was really blindsided,\" she said. \"I knew I was going to have a teacher's retirement. I was going to be part of the Louisiana Teachers Retirement System. And I never really thought about my husband's income and what that would mean to me.\"",
      "Who is affected?",
      "Nearly 2.8 million individuals across the United States are impacted by WEP and GPO. Its effects extend to all employees of state, county, municipal and special districts in 26 states. Teachers in 13 of those states, including specific districts in Kentucky and Georgia, also feel its impact.",
      "In Massachusetts and certain districts in Rhode Island, not all municipal employees, but only teachers are impacted.",
      "The purpose of these two 1980s-era programs was \"so that there was no way you could 'double dip' into both a federal pension and Social Security,\" explains Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst.",
      "The Windfall Elimination Provision affects people who qualify for Social Security benefits through their job but also receive a pension from another job where they didn't pay into Social Security.",
      "It may decrease their Social Security payments by up to half the value of their pension.",
      "For example, Michelle Cosgrove's benefits will be cut nearly in half \u2014 reduced by $557, to $601.",
      "Cosgrove spent the first half of her career as a paralegal, contributing to Social Security, before staying home to raise her children.",
      "Later, she became a public school teacher in the San Francisco Bay Area, paying into CalSTRS, California's educator pension fund. However, her plans for retirement took an unexpected turn when she discovered the intricacies of the pension system.",
      "When she retired, Cosgrove's reduced payments affected her ability to pay bills and cover expenses.",
      "The other program, the Government Pension Offset, further impacted Cosgrove after her husband, Mike, passed away in 2022. Despite working in the private sector for decades and contributing to Social Security, his benefits were largely inaccessible to her due to the GPO. Mike, a welding supervisor, was diagnosed with a rare cancer at 52 but continued working until his health worsened. He died at the age of 63.",
      "If pension recipients are a widow or widower of someone who received Social Security benefits, that pension recipient may have reduced survivors benefits or may not receive benefits at all.",
      "\"If I'd have stayed home and done nothing, I'd have gotten all the money,\" Cosgrove said. \"Had I known this, I might not have gone into teaching. I'd have picked something different.\"",
      "The GPO mainly affects women, with 83% of those impacted by GPO being female, according data from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"When you see the numbers of the GPO elevated, it's because many of those people were probably teachers and married to somebody who worked in a Social Security job,\" said Joslyn DeLancey, vice president of the Connecticut Education Association. \"They're not going to get that spousal Social Security. \u2026 It's such a messy and nuanced thing.\"",
      "Paternostro estimates she would have received $2,500 a month in Social Security benefits \u2014 about $300,000 over the last decade.",
      "\"That's a lot of money,\" she said. \"That's more money than I can imagine.\"",
      "But these policies brought a different kind of heartache for Dede Ruel, a retired school psychologist in Illinois.",
      "She said she recently received a letter from Social Security informing her that she owed more than $13,000, reducing her Social Security checks by 21%.",
      "According to a CBS News analysis of federal data, these policies are one of the most common reasons for Social Security overpayments, which have totaled more than $450 million in fiscal years 2017-2021.",
      "\"I have been trying to appeal it through their process and I've been denied at every level,\" Ruel said.",
      "The Social Security Administration's press office provided comments after the initial publication of this story, stating that \"state and local government employers are\u00a0required\u00a0to disclose potential effects of WEP/GPO on newly hired non-covered employees.\"",
      "\"We work to pay the right people the right amounts at the right time, and Social Security issues correct payments in most cases,\" a Social Security spokesperson said. \"However, there is room to improve, as people count on the agency to prevent overpayments and underpayments from happening.\"",
      "Bipartisan support for the Social Security Fairness Act",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act, one of the most bipartisan bills in Congress this session, aims to repeal WEP and GPO.",
      "The House\u00a0voted\u00a0to pass the legislation Nov. 12. The Senate is expected to vote on the Social Security Fairness Act this week.",
      "Social Security is projected to run out of funds in 2035 unless there is a change made to the fund's cost and revenue system.",
      "Even though supporters of the Social Security Fairness Act argue it will only drain the Social Security fund six months earlier than otherwise expected, some critics believe there are better solutions, suggesting states should restructure their retirement systems to address the root causes rather than rely on federal fixes.",
      "\"A lot of the critics say this is gonna cost a lot of money, almost $200 billion dollars over the next 10 years,\" explains Schlesinger. \"Critics say there is a reason why we force people to pay into the Social Security system. These are two separate systems. If we need to fix Social Security, let's fix it. Let's not just do a repeal which is essentially a Band-Aid.\"",
      "Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who spearheaded the bill, said, \"People should receive benefits based on what they paid into the system. That's what the formula should largely be based upon. I understand the efforts back in the '70s and '80s, but the overcorrection has likely taken $600 to $700 billion in benefits from these folks.\"",
      "Devin Carroll, a financial planner, encounters many clients who are \"completely taken by surprise.\" Carroll often instructs his clients to use the Social Security Administration's WEP calculator, a tool that calculates benefits with the impact of the WEP factored in.",
      "Carroll explains that it can be challenging to figure out future Social Security benefits. The benefits formula includes \"bend points,\" which are adjusted annually based on wage inflation.",
      "These adjustments are crucial because the actual amount of the WEP reduction is determined the year a person turns 62.",
      "\"You have to make some projections, some assumptions about forward-looking inflation, both price inflation and wage inflation,\" Carroll explained. \"Once you do, then you can start to work through that and use a calculator like the SSA has that will do a lot of that for you, and it will tell you what your WEP adjusted for retirement age benefit should be.\"",
      "Carroll also gets to see the impacts of these provisions firsthand. His daughter-in-law is a teacher in Texas and his son is a firefighter in Texas.",
      "\"In essence, this money has been stolen from all of us for all these years,\" Paternostro said. \"It's not fair.\"",

      "The measure comes as personal bankruptcies\u00a0compared this year with 2023 levels. More than 400,000 Americans have filed for bankruptcy in 2024, although that figure is far below their pre-pandemic average of about 750,000 personal bankruptcy filings a year.",
      "Warren said her bill would help families \"avoid eviction, keep homes and cars and discharge local government fines.\" It would also create a repayment plan for unsecured debt, including student loans, as well as eliminate a restriction that bars people from shedding private and public student debt in bankruptcy, like other types of consumer loans.",
      "Rep. Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, are co-leading a House version of the bill, while Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse will cosponsor the measure in the Senate.

    "story": [
      "World coal use is set to reach an all-time high in 2024, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, in a year all but certain to be the hottest in recorded history.",
      "Despite calls to halt humanity's burning of the filthiest fossil fuel driving climate change, the energy watchdog expects global demand for coal to hit record highs for the third year in a row.",
      "Scientists have warned that planet-warming greenhouse gases will have to be drastically slashed to limit global heating to avoid catastrophic impacts on the Earth and humanity.",
      "Earlier in December, the European Union's climate monitor Copernicus said 2024 was \"effectively certain\" to be the hottest on record \u2014 eclipsing the mark set just last year.",
      "Published on Wednesday, the IEA's \"Coal 2024\" report does, however, predict the world will hit peak coal use in 2027 after topping 8.77 billion tons this year.",
      "But that would be dependent on China, which for the past quarter-century has consumed 30 percent more coal than the rest of the world's countries combined, the IEA said.",
      "China's demand for electricity was the most significant driving force behind the increase, with more than a third of coal burnt worldwide carbonized in that country's power plants.",
      "Though Beijing has sought to diversify its electricity sources, including a massive expansion of solar and wind power, the IEA said China's coal demand in 2024 will still hit 4.9 billion tones \u2014 itself another record.",
      "Increasing coal demand in China, as well as in emerging economies such as India and Indonesia, made up for a continued decline in advanced economies.",
      "However that decline has slowed in the European Union and the United States. Coal use there is set to decline by 12 and five percent respectively, compared with 23 and 17 percent in 2023.",

      "The energy watchdog warned that the explosion in power-hungry data centers powering the emergence of artificial intelligence was likewise likely to drive up demand for power generation, with that trend underpinning electricity demand in coal-guzzling China.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:59:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. government faced the threat of a shutdown if Congress didn't pass a spending bill before Dec. 21, 2024. Here's a look at the potential impact.",
    "story": [
      "Update, 12:45 a.m. Saturday:\u00a0The U.S. government avoided a prolonged government shutdown after the Senate approved a\u00a0funding bill\u00a0in the early morning hours Saturday, sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature. The Senate approval came after the House on Friday night overwhelmingly approved the measure as well, just ahead of the midnight deadline.",
      "As the fight over a federal spending bill went down to the wire, the U.S. faced a looming deadline for a government shutdown that could have began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. That raised questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted if funding lapsed just days before the holidays.",
      "The threat of a shutdown stemmed from controversy over a spending bill that would have extended funding through March 14, but which fell apart after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill. A revised version also failed on Thursday before another attempt on Friday passed in the House.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Could a shutdown hurt the U.S. economy?",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers, among other impacts, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "\"A government shutdown could leave a visible mark on the economy,\" he wrote. \"Apart from the direct macroeconomic consequences of a shutdown, financial markets and private sector confidence could also be affected.\"",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate early Saturday morning overwhelmingly approved a bill to avert a prolonged government shutdown, just hours after the House passed the measure with wide bipartisan support. The Senate vote came just after the Friday midnight deadline that would have marked the beginning of the shutdown.",
      "The Senate vote shortly after 12:30 a.m. was by a margin of 85-11, with most Democrats and Republicans supporting the measure. The bill now heads to President Biden for his signature. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 366 in favor to 34 against and one member voting present, with more Democrats voting to support it than Republicans.",
      "Early Saturday morning, the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement that it had \"ceased shutdown preparations because there is a high degree of confidence that Congress will imminently pass the relevant appropriations and the President will sign the bill on Saturday.\"",
      "\"Tonight the Senate delivers good news to America: There will be no government shutdown right before Christmas,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said just prior to the vote. \"This is a good bill, it will keep the government open. And helps Americans affected by hurricanes and natural disasters, helps our farmers and avoids harmful cuts.\"",
      "It capped a chaotic week in Washington that saw President-elect Donald Trump torpedo a deal that House Speaker Mike Johnson reached with Democrats, a potential glimpse at the difficulties Republicans will face when they assume control of Congress and the White House next month.",
      "The measure extends current government funding through March 14 and provides $100 billion in disaster relief funds to help with hurricane recovery and other natural disasters. It also allocates $10 billion in aid to farmers.",
      "It does not address the debt ceiling, something Trump had demanded during the tumultuous back-and-forth over the course of the week. House Republicans instead vowed to address the issue in a future tax bill once Trump is in power.",
      "Johnson painted the measure as a \"necessary step to bridge the gap\" before Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress and the White House in January.",
      "\"Trying to jam a debt ceiling suspension into the legislation at the 11th hour was not sustainable,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote. Jeffries later praised the bill's passage, saying \"House Democrats have successfully stopped the billionaire boys club.\"",
      "The White House expressed support for the legislation as House members were voting on the floor.",
      "\"While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster relief that the president requested for the communities recovering from the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to operate at full capacity,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "A tumultuous week in Washington",
      "The bill was Johnson's third attempt this week to extend government funding and avoid a politically perilous shutdown heading into the holidays.",
      "An earlier deal he crafted over several weeks of talks with Democrats collapsed when Republicans, led by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, revolted against many spending provisions that went beyond extending funding at current levels.",
      "Trump's opposition sank that version of the bill, which stretched to 1,547 pages. He simultaneously issued a new demand: Republicans should suspend or abolish the debt ceiling. Doing so would effectively eliminate a source of leverage for Democrats when he is in power next year.",
      "Johnson tried to placate Trump by bringing up a slimmed-down, 116-page version of the bill on Thursday. It included disaster relief, farm aid and the debt ceiling. Trump immediately backed it, calling it a \"SUCCESS\" and \"a very good deal.\"",
      "But many House Republicans were not as enthusiastic, and balked at suspending the debt limit after years of railing against runaway deficit spending in Washington. Thirty-eight of them bucked the incoming president and voted down the bill, sending Johnson back to the drawing board.",
      "The speaker huddled with fellow Republicans on Friday afternoon to chart a new path forward. He settled on a plan to bring up the bill without the debt ceiling suspension that irked many conservatives and nearly all Democrats.",
      "Republicans made quick work of passing the bill, and it sailed through with a strong majority.",
      "Trump, for his part, publicly stayed quiet about the third version of the bill, while Musk questioned whether it was \"a Republican bill or a Democrat bill.\"",
      "Johnson said after its passage that he was in constant communication with Trump throughout the process.",
      "\"He knew exactly what we were doing and why,\" Johnson said. \"I think he certainly is happy about this outcome as well.\"",
      "The speaker revealed he had also spoken with Musk shortly before the vote.",
      "\"We talked about the extraordinary challenges of this job,\" Johnson said. \"And I said, 'Hey, do you want to be speaker of the House?' \u2026He said, 'This may be the hardest job in the world.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned Friday that his agency could suffer \"serious\" consequences if Congress failed to pass legislation funding federal agencies and avert a government shutdown. The warning came before the House passed a last-minute stopgap funding bill with bipartisan support Friday night, sending it to the Senate ahead of the deadline.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Mayorkas said many components of the Department of Homeland Security would be affected by a lapse in funding, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA and Border Patrol.",
      "The homeland security chief added that a failure by lawmakers to pass a stopgap spending bill before Saturday would also mean staff at the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office would be redirected to other parts of his department.",
      "\"The implications and the consequences are serious, especially when it comes to Homeland Security,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "He urged Congress to approve legislation that would keep government agencies operating before midnight, when a short-term extension enacted in September will expire.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled earlier this week a legislative package negotiated with Democrats that would have extended government funding through March 14, provided more than $100 billion in disaster aid for states impacted by extreme weather events, and given members of Congress a pay raise, among other provisions.",
      "But the proposal was swiftly met with pushback from some conservative Republicans, who balked at the size and scope of the 1,550 page deal. Crucially, it was also criticized by billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, and then by the incoming president himself.",
      "Trump and Musk torpedoed the package, with Musk taking to X, the social media platform he owns, to lambaste provisions of it. The president-elect further upended negotiations over a funding deal when he called on Republicans to address the debt limit \u2014 which is set to be reinstated Jan. 1 \u2014 in their plan.",
      "Johnson unveiled a second measure Thursday, which would have funded the government for three months, suspended the nation's borrowing limit until January 2027 and provided $110 billion in disaster relief. The more tailored legislation, which Trump backed, also included health care provisions, a one-year renewal of the farm bill and funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which collapsed in March.",
      "But that package failed to pass the House with the necessary support after it was opposed by most Democrats and more than three dozen Republicans.",
      "That defeat sent Johnson and GOP leaders back to the drawing board, with the prospect of a shutdown rising with each passing hour.",
      "Mayorkas told \"Face the Nation\" that a shutdown just before the holidays \u2014 when tens of millions of Americans are traveling \u2014 would mean TSA employees at airports throughout the country would be forced to work without pay. However, they would likely receive backpay after a shutdown ends, as has happened before after previous funding lapses.",
      "\"We're going to have tens of thousands of TSA employees working an incredibly high volume of passenger traffic throughout our airports across the country, and they will be doing so keeping the American public safe without pay,\" he said.",
      "The Homeland Security secretary also said those impacted would include U.S. Border Patrol agents stationed along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"There are people in government service who are dedicating their talent and their energy to the well-being of the American people, who rely on their paychecks to make ends meet, and it is the holiday season, after all, but our men and women on the border will be guarding the border of the United States at no pay if funding doesn't come through,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "The $110 billion in disaster assistance that will likely be included in a spending deal includes money for FEMA, which has been responding to the hurricanes that devastated the southeast this fall.",
      "Mayorkas said that inaction by Congress would impact those states hit by the storms, including North Carolina and Florida.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Friday confirmed two more of President Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday, giving him a total of 235 since he took office, surpassing\u00a0the number of judges approved for lifetime appointment during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The confirmation of Benjamin Cheeks to the federal district court in Southern California was followed by the confirmation of Serena Murillo to the federal district court in Central California.",
      "As he nears the end of his presidency, Mr. Biden will close out his four years in office having appointed one Supreme Court justice, 45 judges to the federal appeals courts, 187 to the district courts and two to the Court of International Trade. His selection of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made history, since she is the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"Today, we celebrate one of the most important accomplishments of this Democratic Senate and the Biden-Harris administration: the confirmation of highly qualified, independent, and evenhanded judges to the federal bench,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, adding, \"More than one out of every four judges now serving on the judicial bench was nominated by President Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Biden has also selected a record number of public defenders to serve as federal judges on the appeals courts, and his nominees are the most diverse compared to those tapped by his predecessors.",
      "There's been heightened focus on the judiciary by presidents in recent years as gridlock in Congress has led to unilateral executive actions on a variety of issues touching on American life. But often those efforts give way to legal challenges, leaving courts as the final deciders in disputes over hot-button policies.",
      "While Mr. Biden will likely end his presidency with more judicial appointments than Trump, he did not see the same level of success as his predecessor in putting his stamp on the Supreme Court. Jackson replaced Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the court's liberal wing, following his retirement in 2022.",
      "But Trump named three justices to the high court, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal member, which locked in a 6-3 conservative supermajority.",
      "Mr. Biden also trails Trump in appointments to the 13 courts of appeals, ending his presidency with 45 judges approved to those courts, compared to Trump's 54.",
      "But Trump had an advantage when he took office in 2017, inheriting 17 appellate court vacancies after the Republican-led Senate blocked then-President Barack Obama's nominees in the last two years of his term. When Mr. Biden started his presidency, there were just two open seats on the courts of appeals.",
      "With a second Trump term on the horizon, some judges who announced their plans to retire have reversed course as it became clear their replacements wouldn't be confirmed before Jan. 3, when Republicans will assume control of the Senate.",
      "Judge James Wynn of the 4th Circuit notified Mr. Biden last week that he would no longer assume senior status, a form of semi-retirement, and the White House withdrew the nomination of his possible successor, North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park.",
      "North Carolina's Republican senators, Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, opposed Park's nomination, and Tillis lambasted Wynn's decision to walk back his retirement, calling it \"brazenly partisan\" and driven by Trump's election.",
      "Two district court judges appointed by Democratic presidents, Judges Max Cogburn and Algenon Marbley, also rescinded their plans to take senior status following Trump's victory, according to Reuters.",
      "The reversals come after Senate Democrats reached a deal with Republicans to allow for swifter consideration of Mr. Biden's district court picks. GOP senators \u2014 with Trump's backing \u2014 had been working to slow the pace of judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but under the deal, they would forego procedural roadblocks on district court nominees if Democrats would not bring four remaining appellate court nominations up for a vote.",

    "title": "Biden's top hostage envoy travels to Syria to ask for help in finding Austin Tice",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 19:59:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Hostage envoy Roger Carstens traveled to Syria Friday, making the first known U.S. in-person contact with the caretaker government, and seeking help in finding missing American Austin Tice.",
    "story": [
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top official for freeing Americans held overseas, traveled to Damascus, Syria, on Friday for a high-risk mission: making the first known face-to-face contact with the caretaker government and asking for help finding missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Tice was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago during the civil war and brutal reign of now-deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. For years, U.S. officials have said they do not know with certainty whether Tice is still alive, where he is being held or by whom.",
      "Following his trip to Syria, in an exclusive interview Friday with \"Face the Nation\" from Amman, Jordan, Carstens disclosed that the U.S. Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs today conducted a \"joint search of a facility\" with\u00a0Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS \u2014 the rebel group that recently overthrew Assad's regime and is emerging as a leading power \u2014 \"that we all thought would have some sort of relation to Austin Tice.\"",
      "He did not disclose the details of the search or its outcome, only saying that HTS was \"being helpful in the search for Austin.\"",
      "\"We had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities,\" Carstens said. \"And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time.\"",
      "Carstens said he was \"stunned\" by the number of prisons the Assad regime was operating.",
      "\"I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country, and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret,\" Carstens said. \"But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating.\"",
      "The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, accompanied Carstens to Damascus as a gesture of broader outreach to HTS.",
      "Near East Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein was also with the delegation. They were the first American diplomats to visit Damascus in over a decade, according to a State Department spokesperson.",
      "They had planned to meet with HTS representatives to discuss transition principles endorsed by the U.S. and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan, the spokesperson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Aqaba last week to meet with Middle East leaders and discuss the situation in Syria.",
      "Security for the U.S. delegation was provided by DSS Mobile Security Deployments, according to a State Department official. U.S. special operations forces also provided support as they traveled by vehicle across the Jordanian border and on the road to Damascus. The convoy was given assurances by HTS that it would be granted safe passage while in Syria, but there remains a threat of attacks by other terrorist groups, including ISIS.",
      "CBS News withheld publication of this story for security concerns at the State Department's request.",
      "While finding and freeing Tice and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime is the ultimate goal, U.S. officials downplayed expectations of a breakthrough on this trip. Multiple sources told CBS News that Carstens and Leaf's intent was to convey U.S. interests to senior HTS leaders, and learn anything they can about Tice.",
      "Rubinstein will lead the U.S. diplomacy in Syria, engaging directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria, the State Department spokesperson added.",
      "Diplomatic outreach to HTS comes in a volatile, war-torn region at an uncertain moment. Two sources even compared the potential danger to the expeditionary diplomacy practiced by the late U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who led outreach to rebels in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and was killed in a terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and intelligence post.",
      "Sending high-level American diplomats to Damascus represents a significant step in reopening U.S.-Syria relations following the fall of the Assad regime less than two weeks ago. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Damascus have been suspended since 2012, shortly after the Assad regime brutally repressed an uprising that became a 14-year civil war and spawned 13 million Syrians to flee the country in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in the world.",
      "The U.S. formally designated HTS, which had ties to al Qaeda, as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Its leader, Mohammed al Jolani, was designated as a terrorist by the US in 2013 and prior to that served time in a US prison in Iraq.",
      "Since toppling Assad, HTS has publicly signaled interest in a new more moderate trajectory. Al Jolani even shed his nom de guerre and now uses his legal name, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "U.S. sanctions on HTS linked to those terrorist designations complicate outreach somewhat, but they haven't prevented American officials from making direct contact with HTS at the direction of President Biden. Blinken recently confirmed that U.S. officials were in touch with HTS representatives prior to Carstens and Leaf's visit.",
      "\"We've heard positive statements coming from Mr. Jolani, the leader of HTS,\" Blinken told Bloomberg News on Thursday. \"But what everyone is focused on is what's actually happening on the ground, what are they doing? Are they working to build a transition in Syria that brings everyone in?\"",
      "In that same interview, Blinken also seemed to dangle the possibility that the U.S. could help lift sanctions on HTS and its leader imposed by the United Nations, if HTS builds what he called an inclusive nonsectarian government and eventually holds elections. The Biden administration is not expected to lift the U.S.\u00a0 terrorist designation before the end of the president's\u00a0 term on January 20th.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder disclosed Thursday that the U.S. currently has approximately 2,000 US troops inside of Syria as part of the mission to defeat ISIS, a far higher number than the 900 troops the Biden administration had previously acknowledged. There are at least five U.S. military bases in the north and south of the country.",
      "The Biden administration is concerned that thousands of ISIS prisoners held at a camp known as al-Hol could be freed. It is currently guarded by the Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish allies of the U.S. who are wary of the newly-powerful HTS. The situation on the ground is rapidly changing since Russia and Iran withdrew military support from the Assad regime, which has reset the balance of power. Turkey, which has been a sometimes problematic U.S. ally, has been a conduit to HTS and is emerging as a power broker.",
      "A high-risk mission like this is unusual for the typically risk averse Biden administration, which has exercised consistently restrained diplomacy. Blinken approved Carstens and Leaf's trip and relevant congressional leaders were briefed on it days ago.",
      "\"I think it's important to have direct communication, it's important to speak as clearly as possible, to listen, to make sure that we understand as best we can where they're going and where they want to go,\" Blinken said Thursday.",
      "At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had not yet met with Assad, who fled to Russia when his regime fell earlier this month. Putin added that he would ask Assad about Austin Tice when they do meet.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:12:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Government watchdog claims Americans lost hundreds of millions to fraud related to the bank-operated mobile payments network.",
    "story": [
      "Three Major banks and Zelle rushed to bring a peer-to-peer payment network to market without first ensuring users would be protected against \"widespread\" fraud, alleges a lawsuit filed on Friday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo ignored customer complaints related to Zelle, with users losing hundreds of millions of dollars in scams, the regulatory agency alleges. Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",
      "JPMorgan also accused the agency of pursuing a \"political agenda,\" stating that the agency was \"overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase said it prevents nearly $20 billion in fraud attempts each year, and that 99.95% of its transactions are completed without dispute.",
      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",
      "\"These troubling alleged practices need to be addressed by all parties as quickly as possible,\" Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's crucial that in our increasingly cashless age, we have digital financial systems that the public can trust and use without fear of losing their money.\"",
      "In 2023 Early Warning\u00a0began refunding money to an undisclosed number of fraud victims amid pressure from lawmakers. In late 2022, Sen. Elizabeth Warren issued a report that found increasing incidents of fraud and scams to be occurring on the popular payment app, with large banks typically reluctant to compensate victims, the Massachusetts Democrat said.",

    "title": "Here's a fact check on Trump's recent comments about the history of U.S. tariffs",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:10:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Historians say Trump falsely said he was the only president to collect revenue from tariffs on Chinese goods, among other claims.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump made claims about the history of U.S. tariff collection as he defended his plan to raise tariffs on goods from countries like China and Mexico in a news conference this week, claims historians say are at odds with the facts.",
      "In particular, Trump exaggerated the impact of tariff hikes during his first term, falsely claiming that \"no other president took in 10 cents\" of revenue from trade collections on Chinese imports. Trump also pointed to 19th-century tariff increases championed by former President William McKinley as evidence that his plan could benefit the economy.",
      "But data shows the federal government had been taking in billions in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports long before Trump came to office, and historians say the high tariff era of the 1890s was economically rocky for Americans.",
      "Tariffs are taxes on imports, often charged as a percentage of the price that importers pay foreign sellers. They aren't paid by foreign nations, but by U.S. companies who often pass the cost to American consumers by raising prices.",
      "In his next term, Trump has pledged to put an additional 10% levy on all Chinese goods, along with a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada. Americans spend more than $1 trillion on goods from those three countries each year, according to data from the Census Bureau.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about history of tariffs on China",
      "In his news conference this week, Trump repeated a claim he made frequently on the campaign trail: that his predecessors essentially took in no money from tariffs on Chinese goods, while his administration took in billions.",
      "Tariffs on Chinese imports have existed since the 1700s, generating billions in revenue for years before Trump came into office.",
      "During President Barack Obama's final year in office, tariff revenue from Chinese imports totaled over $12 billion, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. That amount increased after Trump's first round of tariff hikes to over $22 billion, the same federal data shows.",
      "Trump did dramatically raise the total revenue generated from Chinese imports by adding tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars'\u00a0worth of goods. However, even with that increase, tariff collections have not accounted for much more than 2% of federal revenue at any point in the last 70 years, according to the Congressional Research Service this month.",
      "The president-elect has argued his tariff plan for his next term could bring in revenue to help defray the cost of income tax cuts.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs estimated that Trump's proposed levies on goods from China, Mexico and Canada could generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year, which would be up from $77 billion in fiscal year 2024.",
      "But tariffs had not been viewed as a primary way to raise revenue since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, said Judith Goldstein, a political science professor at Stanford.",
      "\"As the U.S. became more involved in the world, the effect of tariffs on domestic production and prices were increasingly a problem,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Trump has also repeatedly argued his tariff plan will help protect U.S. companies. There's some evidence that the customs duties he imposed in his first term boosted jobs in specific industries like washing machine manufacturing, according to research from the Brookings Institution, a think tank. However, manufacturers also faced higher costs for raw materials and retaliatory tariffs from other nations, according to the Federal Reserve.",
      "What Trump gets wrong about the McKinley tariffs",
      "This week, Trump also cited McKinley's 1890 tariff hikes as evidence that these customs taxes can enrich the U.S.",
      "\"You go back and look at the 1890s, 1880s, McKinley, and you take a look at tariffs, that was when we were proportionately the richest,\" Trump said.",
      "In 1890, tariff hikes raised the average duties on foreign imports from 38% to nearly 50%. McKinley, a representative for Ohio at the time, pushed for the taxes to protect his state's steelworkers from foreign competition, according to Dartmouth College economics professor Doug Irwin.",
      "However, the decade that followed these hikes was marked by economic trouble.",
      "\"The U.S. went into a depression in 1893, and we didn't really emerge out of it until the mid-1890s. So in general the 1890s was not a great decade for the U.S. economy,\" Irwin said.",
      "Additionally, McKinley's tariff bill raised prices of goods like shoes and clothes, leading to voter backlash that cost Republicans 93 seats in the next election, according to the House of Representatives\u00a0Office of the Historian.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for clarification on why he said America was \"proportionately the richest\" after this bill passed.",
      "Historic data shows gross domestic product per capita for Americans has vastly increased from about $6,400 in the early 1890s (in 2017 dollars) to roughly $69,000 today (in 2024 dollars).",
      "\"It is unclear why he's picking on the 1890s as this golden age. It wasn't considered good times, at least by the people living through it at the time,\" Irwin said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 13:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump added a wrinkle to negotiations over a deal to fund the government when he called for an increase to the debt ceiling.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk blew up a GOP-backed deal to fund federal agencies into March, raising the pressure on Republican congressional leaders to craft a plan to avert a government shutdown just before the holidays.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Trump and Vance lambasted the original agreement for including provisions favored by Democrats. But the incoming president and vice president also added a new, significant wrinkle to negotiations when they urged Congress to raise or abolish the debt ceiling now, instead of next year.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance said in their statement. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\"",
      "House GOP leadership responded to Trump's push to address the nation's borrowing limit with a proposal that would fund federal agencies until mid-March, suspend the debt limit for two years and provide $110 billion in disaster aid, among other provisions. But the plan failed on the House floor, with 38 Republicans joining nearly all Democrats in voting against it despite Trump endorsing it.",
      "Lawmakers are returning to Capitol Hill on Friday, hours before the government shuts down absent legislative action, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"we've got a plan.\"",
      "What is the debt ceiling?",
      "Set by Congress, the debt ceiling, or limit, is the maximum amount of money the U.S. Treasury is authorized to borrow to pay debts incurred by the federal government. Lifting the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending, but instead lets the government spend money on obligations that Congress has already approved.",
      "Failing to address the debt ceiling could lead the U.S. to default on its debt, which would have devastating effects on the economy. The government has never defaulted, and the Treasury typically uses accounting moves, known as \"extraordinary measures,\" to delay breaching the debt ceiling.",
      "While raising the debt ceiling used to be routine, legislation addressing it has in recent years been used as leverage to force policy concessions and fuel debates over government spending.",
      "Congress last addressed the debt ceiling in June 2023 as part of a legislative package negotiated by President Biden and then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. That deal suspended the debt ceiling through Jan., 1, 2025, ensuring any fight over it would take place after the 2024 elections.",
      "The Treasury Department will likely implement extraordinary measures to stave off a default in the new year. It will also announce an \"X date,\" the estimated point at which the government will no longer be able to pay its obligations. The Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, projected in an analysis released Monday that it's possible the debt limit will be reached by June 16.",
      "While the Treasury Department's use of extraordinary measures would give Congress more time to address the debt ceiling, Trump is now urging lawmakers to take action now, before he takes office.",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to borrow on behalf of the U.S., and Congress has delegated that authority to the executive branch, while placing a limit on the amount of debt that can be outstanding. Lawmakers could pass a bill to repeal the debt limit, and proposals to do so were introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate in the past several legislative sessions, although they all failed.",
      "Why does Trump want to raise the debt ceiling?",
      "The president-elect will come into office with a legislative to-do list that includes securing the border and extending provisions of his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in 2017 and overhauled the tax code. But a fight over the debt ceiling could complicate efforts by the Republican-led House and Senate to focus on those legislative initiatives and pass them quickly.",
      "Trump is urging lawmakers to eliminate the debt ceiling altogether, a position that some prominent Democrats have endorsed in the past.",
      "\"Number one, the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" Trump said in a phone interview Thursday with CBS News' Robert Costa. \"Number two, a lot of the different things they thought they'd receive [in a recently proposed spending deal] are now going to be thrown out, 100 percent. And we'll see what happens. We'll see whether or not we have a closure during the Biden administration. But if it's going to take place, it's going to take place during Biden, not during Trump.\"",
      "Trump separately told ABC News that \"there won't be anything approved unless the debt ceiling is done with,\" indicating any spending deal to prevent a shutdown must address the debt limit.",
      "\"If we don't get it, then we're going to have a shutdown, but it'll be a Biden shutdown, because shutdowns only [injure] the person who's president,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Hours after the funding proposal backed by Trump failed on the House floor, the president-elect suggested that lawmakers should suspend the debt ceiling for four years, the length of his second term.",
      "\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is president,\" he wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Fiscal conservatives in the House have balked at the notion of raising or suspending the borrowing limit without spending reforms, and debates over the debt limit often give way to broader fights over the federal budget, which Republicans in Congress have said is bloated and should be reduced. Plus, Democrats still control the Senate and the White House.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Wednesday that shutting down the government would harm families and endanger services Americans rely on.",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said. \"President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance ordered Republicans to shut down the government and they are threatening to do just that \u2014 while undermining communities recovering from disasters, farmers and ranchers, and community health centers.\"",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries suggested Democrats would not go along with a plan pushed by Republicans to raise the debt limit.",
      "\"GOP extremists want House Democrats to raise the debt ceiling so that House Republicans can lower the amount of your Social Security check. Hard pass,\" the New York Democrat wrote on the social media platform Bluesky.",
      "Jeffries also told reporters \"the debt limit issue and discussion is premature at best.\"",

Only a simple majority is needed for final passage in the Senate in order to pass the bill to President Biden's desk.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure on Wednesday.

      "The Senate was scheduled to reconvene on Friday, and is expected to resume consideration of the measure after votes related to confirming two judges to serve in California.",
      "\"We will vote on taking up the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal flawed policies that eat away at the benefits of those who've worked as teachers, firefighters, postal workers, or public sector workers,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Wednesday. \"Retirees deprived of their hard-earned benefits will be watching closely.\"",
      "The New York Democrat has pushed to bring the measure up for a full vote, which would eliminate two federal policies that prevent million of Americans, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber ahead of Wednesday's vote. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican relayed having a retired teacher cry in his office, \"not understanding why she was getting less in Social Security spousal benefits than if she had never worked at all.\"",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis spoke against measure, saying that while a small percentage of people are not getting what they should from Social Security, enacting what he framed as an unfunded government mandate that would increase the federal deficit \"is not the way to fix it.\"",
      "\"This bill will take $200 billion during the 10-year period out of the Social Security trust fund without any way to pay for it,\" the North Carolina Republican added.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that broadly reduce payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "\"This stuff takes time, but 21 years is ridiculous,\" said Brown of the process. The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded some in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "At least one GOP senator who signed onto similar legislation last year, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was still \"weighing\" whether to vote for the bill. \"Nothing ever gets paid for, so it's further indebtedness, I don't know,\" Braun said last week, the Associated Press reported.",
      "That said, Braun did vote to proceed with the legislation on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Mr. Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Mr. Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Mr. Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through the PSLF.",
      "\"From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\"",
      "Still, he has fallen short of his goal to deliver widespread relief to millions of other Americans. Mr. Biden's first attempt at mass cancellation was blocked by the Supreme Court, and his second attempt remains tangled in a legal battle brought by Republican states.",
      "In October, he proposed another rule that would cancel loans for people facing various kinds of financial hardship, though it's unlikely to take effect.",
      "President-elect Trump hasn't detailed student loan plans for his second term, but on the campaign trail he called Mr. Biden's cancellation plans illegal and \"vile.\" Republicans in Congress have slammed Mr. Biden over his cancellation work, saying it unfairly transfers the burden to taxpayers who didn't go to college or already repaid their loans.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 08:24:52 -0500",
    "summary": "ICE deported more than a quarter-million unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2024, the highest tally in a decade.",
    "story": [
      "Deportations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement soared to a 10-year high in fiscal year 2024 under the Biden administration, surpassing the Trump-era high recorded in 2019, according to a government report released Thursday.",
      "ICE deported more than 271,000 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2024, the highest tally recorded by the agency since fiscal year 2014, when the Obama administration carried out 316,000 deportations. In fiscal year 2019, ICE reported 267,000 deportations, the peak under the Trump administration. Fiscal years start in October and end in September.",
      "While the incoming Trump administration has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in American history next year, the statistics released by ICE show the Biden administration has already overseen a dramatic increase in deportations in its final year in office.",
      "In fiscal year 2021, which included the first months of the Biden administration, ICE deportations plunged to 59,000, a record low for the 21-year-old agency. The drop was mainly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and rules enacted by the Biden administration that efficiently shielded most unauthorized immigrants from deportation if they were not serious criminals, national security threats or recent border crossers.",
      "ICE deportations increased to 72,000 in fiscal year 2022 and then to 143,000 in fiscal year 2023, as the Biden administration increased deportation efforts in response to record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, and as border officials relied less heavily on a pandemic-era expulsion policy known as Title 42. Expulsions of migrants under that measure were not counted as formal deportations because they were carried out under a public health law.",
      "Border crackdown fueled jump in deportations",
      "In the report it released Thursday, ICE said the sharp jump in deportations last fiscal year stemmed from increased steps to streamline the deportation process, as well as diplomatic efforts to convince countries to take back more deportees. The agency noted that it increased deportations flights to traditional migrant-sending countries in Latin America, but also to far-flung nations in Africa and Asia, including China, which did not accept U.S. deportations for years.",
      "Most of the deportations in fiscal year 2024 involved migrants who were apprehended by U.S. border officials, as opposed to those arrested by ICE in the interior of the country, the agency report shows. Roughly 82% of the 271,000 immigrants deported that year were first arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The rest were initially arrested by ICE in jails or during operations in communities.",
      "ICE's deportation numbers don't include removals and returns of migrants by Border Patrol officials at the U.S.-Mexico border. Those returns also increased this year after President Biden sharply limited asylum through a June executive order that, alongside Mexico's efforts to interdict migrants, led to a dramatic decrease in illegal border crossings.",
      "What's awaiting the Trump administration?",
      "While deportations rose significantly this past year, the Trump administration will still inherit a massive workload at ICE, which is tracking millions of unauthorized immigrants.",
      "At the end of fiscal year 2024, ICE's so-called non-detained docket of cases of immigrants facing deportation due to immigration violations had ballooned to nearly 7.7 million, up from 3.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. The spike in cases mainly reflects the record releases of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border during Mr. Biden's presidency before he announced the asylum restrictions in June.",
      "The incoming Trump administration has promised to start a wave of mass deportations as soon as the president-elect takes office on Jan. 20. Incoming border czar Tom Homan has said ICE will first target unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and the estimated 1.4 million people with pending deportation orders. But he has also stressed no one in the country illegally will be exempt from deportation.",
      "To carry out the deportations at the monumental scale that incoming Trump administration officials have outlined, ICE would need a dramatic infusion in resources and manpower, as the agency currently has 41,000 detention beds and roughly 6,000 deportation officers. There were more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in early 2022, according to the latest government estimate.",
      "Homan has suggested enlisting the Department of Defense to help ICE, including by allowing the agency to carry out deportations using military aircraft. Incoming White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has also floated a proposal to deputize National Guard soldiers to arrest and deport immigrants living in the country illegally.",

    "summary": "Biden's most recent climate initiatives are all but certain to be short-lived, mostly thanks to an obscure law that tends to come into play every four years.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election set in motion a race against time by President Biden to safeguard his environmental legacy in his remaining days as president.",
      "But his administration's stepped-up pace of climate-related announcements will likely mean little once Trump is inaugurated and the Republican-led Congress is seated in January. Mr. Biden's most recent climate initiatives are all but certain to be short-lived, mostly thanks to an obscure law that tends to come into play every four years.",
      "That law, the Congressional Review Act, allows Congress to kill any regulation issued by a federal agency in the last 60 legislative days with a simple majority vote in the House and Senate and the signature of the president.",
      "Since Election Day, the Biden administration has announced final rules that include one to dramatically curb methane emissions and another that bans all future coal mining leases on federal lands. Both rules are expected to be rolled back soon after Trump takes office.",
      "Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, after carbon dioxide, but it traps heat in the atmosphere at 28 times the rate of carbon dioxide, the Environmental Protection Agency has observed. On the upside, methane doesn't remain in the atmosphere for as long as CO2, so cutting methane emissions can have a much quicker, more dramatic impact on lowering greenhouse gases. Human sources of methane emissions include oil and gas systems, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities and a host of other industrial processes.",
      "On Nov. 12, the Biden administration announced a final rule that will charge oil and natural gas companies a hefty fee if they exceed methane emission limits. It's an effort to encourage these companies to improve their processes to reduce methane leaks.",
      "The EPA estimates that implementing the methane emissions rule would be akin to taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year.",
      "The Biden administration also recently blocked all new coal mining leases on public lands, which would affect new leases in Wyoming and Montana, the source of 40% of the nation's coal. The Associated Press pointed to government analyses that said ending federal leasing would reduce emissions by the equivalent of 293 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, roughly on par with eliminating emissions from 63 million gas-powered cars.",
      "Existing leases would still allow mining in the region to continue for decades. But coal has been losing ground in recent years, as the U.S. has steadily come to rely more on cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources \u2014 and less on coal.",
      "Republican politicians in Wyoming and Montana denounced the ban, and GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said in a statement that he's ready to work with Trump to reverse the ban and other regulations.",
      "In Trump's view, fears about climate change are overblown or premature. He's called it a \"hoax\" in the past. He opposes clean energy and EV subsidies and has said what America needs to do is \"drill, baby drill\" \u2014 that is, increase traditional oil and gas production in order to bring down energy prices for Americans. This shouldn't come as a surprise \u2014 in his first term, upon taking office, he overturned 100 environmental rules enacted by President Obama.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump promised business-friendly policies that he claimed would halve energy costs in a year by approving new drilling and slashing red tape.",
      "Some experts doubt that'll happen.",
      "\"There is no universe in which decisions by the federal government can cause that extent of a reaction from markets,\" Jonathan Elkind, senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University told CBS News. \"The oil markets, they are too big, they are too global, and the president of the United States does not have the capability to exert influence that is as strong as that.\"",
      "There are still, however, some Biden climate policies that are likely to be out of Trump's reach.",
      "Billions in clean energy investment was set aside in the 2022 climate law, the most significant climate change legislation ever signed. But the key to protecting that funding is making sure the money is spent, or allocated, before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.",
      "Once the grant money is spent, Trump and Republicans are highly unlikely to be able to claw it back.",
      "\"Legally, any obligated fund is safe,\" said Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs at World Resources Institute. \"If you listen to incoming administration officials, they are saying that they're going to go after that. I don't think they're going to have a legal leg to stand on if it's been obligated.\"",
      "The EPA says it's learned over the years that the surest way to protect climate policy is to tie a regulation directly to legislation and funding.",
      "In total, about $643.1 billion, or over 93% of funding available, has been obligated, according to a White House official. Billions remain to be spent under the climate law in the next fiscal year, and some Republicans may want to keep the climate spending in their districts and states.",
      "Trying to take the grant funding back would mean \"potentially taking away benefits to communities, both in terms of public health protections, but also economic benefits,\" EPA senior adviser for implementation Zealan Hoover told CBS News.",
      "And these grants are also far from the most expensive line-items in the climate law. The Energy Department announced almost $18 million for projects that bolster recycling programs, launch residential energy efficiency rebate programs and expand bike lanes and pedestrian walkways, among other projects. The Agriculture Department put $256 million toward the Rural Energy Program for America to expand use of wind, solar, geothermal and small hydropower energy.",
      "These kinds of projects and the grants are likely to be safe through Trump's second term.",

      "In a move that has stunned Washington, President-elect Donald Trump is now urging Congress to eliminate the debt ceiling, dramatically shaking up talks among lawmakers, who are at an impasse over federal spending and on government funding, which is scheduled to lapse this weekend.",
      "While some on Capitol Hill have balked at Trump's latest demand, the president-elect was unwavering on Thursday. He said he is determined to hold his position that lawmakers should both oppose any sweeping spending measure that includes \"traps\" from Democrats and abolish the debt limit before he takes office next year.",
      "\"Number one, the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely,\" Trump said in a phone interview. \"Number two, a lot of the different things they thought they'd receive [in a recently proposed spending deal] are now going to be thrown out, 100%. And we'll see what happens. We'll see whether or not we have a closure during the Biden administration. But if it's going to take place, it's going to take place during Biden, not during Trump.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which have sent negotiators in both parties back to the drawing board ahead of the expiration of government funding at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, came a day after he\u00a0called\u00a0a bipartisan spending deal \"ridiculous and extraordinarily expensive\" and said that any legislation to extend the federal government's funding should also include plans for \"terminating or extending\" the debt limit.",
      "Still, Trump, who built a decades-long business career as a negotiator and dealmaker, appeared to leave room for House Speaker Mike Johnson and other top Republicans to find consensus on new options that he would find sufficient.",
      "When asked how he would like to see this standoff end, Trump replied, \"It's going to end in a number of ways that would be very good.\"",
      "Trump said the discussions are ongoing and it is too soon for him to spell out more details on what the contours of a final agreement should be.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Trump said. \"It's too early.\"",
      "But Trump said he will continue to closely track how Democrats might seek to influence any revised deal and voiced displeasure at how the initial bipartisan deal had Democratic provisions.",
      "\"We caught them trying to lay traps. And I wasn't going to stand for it,\" he said. \"There are not going to be any traps by the radical left, crazy Democrats.\"",
      "In a post on his Truth Social app early Friday, Trump doubled down, saying, \"\"Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling. Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President.\"",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a billionaire who spent almost $300 million to back Trump and other Republican candidates in the November elections, also opposed the initial bipartisan spending deal, which he called \"terrible.\" When Johnson scrapped it, Musk wrote on X, \"The voice of the people has triumphed!\"",
      "Trump's focus on the debt ceiling, which caps the federal government's borrowing authority, comes as he faces a showdown over the issue during the first year of his upcoming term. That prospect, several people close to Trump say, has drawn his attention because he wants to spend his time and political capital next year on other issues and would prefer Congress address it now.",
      "While the current cap on federal borrowing is suspended until Jan. 1, 2025, the Treasury Department would be able to take steps to avoid default for a few months into next year. Nevertheless, the government could face an economically fraught default sometime early next year should the debt ceiling not be extended or addressed by Congress.",
      "When asked Thursday about Trump's call to address the debt limit, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic leader, said, \"The debt-limit issue and discussion is premature at best.\"",

      "In Thursday's filing, his lawyers wrote the former governor faced \"a cascade of harm\" as a result of Bennett's allegations.",

      "\"After carefully considering the trial court's findings in its order, we conclude that it erred by failing to disqualify DA Willis and her office,\" the court's majority found. \"The remedy crafted by the trial court to prevent an ongoing appearance of impropriety did nothing to address the appearance of impropriety that existed at times when DA Willis was exercising her broad pretrial discretion about who to prosecute and what charges to bring..\"",
      "The court, which divided 2-1, said that in this case, \"disqualification is mandated and no other remedy will suffice to restore public confidence in the integrity of these proceedings.\" But it did not dismiss the indictment, leaving it in place. The prosecution will likely be referred to a body known as the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council for reassignment.",
      "Judge Trenton Brown wrote for the majority that \"while this is the rare case\" in which Willis and her office must be removed because of a \"significant appearance of impropriety,\" the record in the case doesn't support the \"imposition of the extreme sanction\" of tossing out the indictment.",
      "Steven Cheung, spokesman for the president-elect, said in a statement that \"in granting President Trump an overwhelming mandate, the American People have demanded an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all the Witch Hunts against him. We look forward to uniting our country as President Trump Makes America Great Again.\"",
      "Steve Sadow, Trump's lawyer, praised the decision as \"well-reasoned and just.\"",
      "\"The court highlighted that Willis' misconduct created an 'odor of mendacity' and an appearance of impropriety that could only be cured by the disqualification of her and her entire office. As the Court rightfully noted, only the remedy of disqualification will suffice to restore public confidence,\" he said in a statement. \"This decision puts an end to a politically motivated persecution of the next president of the United States.\"",
      "Willis' office notified the court of appeals that they intend to ask the Georgia Supreme Court to review its\u00a0decision.",
      "In March, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis from the case over a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as a special prosecutor in November 2021 to assist in the investigation into Trump and his allies. McAfee had ruled that Willis and the Fulton County District Attorney's Office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he did.",
      "Trump and eight co-defendants\u00a0appealed McAfee's ruling. The Georgia Court of Appeals was set to hold a hearing earlier this month, but canceled the proceedings after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency in November. He is set to be sworn in for a second term Jan. 20.",
      "Raised by Michael Roman, a longtime GOP operative charged alongside Trump, the bombshell revelation of Willis and Wade's relationship roiled the prosecution and derailed proceedings in the case for months. McAfee held a multi-day evidentiary hearing examining whether Willis had a conflict of interest in the case through her relationship with Wade and travels with him.",
      "Roman had claimed the two started dating before Wade was hired to work on the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and alleged that Willis financially benefited from the relationship. Trump and seven others joined Roman's effort to remove Willis and her office from the case and have the charges against them dismissed.",
      "Willis and Wade admitted they were romantically involved but denied any wrongdoing. They testified that the relationship began after Wade was hired, and that it ended last summer.",
      "While McAfee's decision was a win for Willis, it lambasted her for what the judge said was a \"tremendous lapse in judgment.\" He criticized the \"unprofessional manner\" of her\u00a0testimony during the evidentiary hearing\u00a0earlier this year, when Wade and Willis separately answered questions from prosecutors and defense attorneys about their relationship.",
      "The judge said that while he was not able to \"conclusively establish\" when Wade and Willis' relationship turned romantic, \"an odor of mendacity remains.\"",
      "Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for Roman, said they are \"pleased\" the appeals court agreed with them that Willis shouldn't have been allowed to prosecute the case.",
      "\"We regret that Ms. Willis did not do the right thing and voluntarily recuse herself when Mr. Roman raised the issue because failing to do so put Judge McAfee in an untenable position,\" she said in a statement. \"This failure of judgment is the exact reason Mr. Roman was forced to move to disqualify her in the first place, so we are thankful that the court agreed she should not be allowed to prosecute this case any further.\"",
      "The prosecution in Fulton County was one of four pursued against Trump. He faced charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith in federal courts in Washington, D.C., and South Florida, and was charged with violating New York law by the Manhattan district attorney.",
      "The Fulton County case had moved the slowest, in part because of the allegations against Willis and Wade. Trump was initially charged with 13 felony counts, but five of them were dismissed by McAfee\u00a0for various reasons. Of the 18 original co-defendants, four\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0after reaching plea deals with prosecutors.",
      "In New York, Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records and was set to be sentenced last month. That sentencing, however, was postponed following his election.",
      "The two federal prosecutions, meanwhile, came to a close last month after Smith sought to dismiss the charges. A longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president, and the special counsel said that applied to Trump's situation.",
      "The first case stemmed from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after he left office in January 2021. The second arose from what Smith claimed was an unlawful scheme to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.",
      "Trump had denied wrongdoing in all of the cases, claiming they were brought by politically motivated prosecutors who sought to harm his campaign for the White House.",
      "Jared Eggleston, \n                                                  \n                                  Graham Kates and \n                                                  \n                                  Daniel Klaidman\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "\"My phone was ringing off the hook,\" Republican Rep. Andy Barr said. \"The people who elected us are listening to Elon Musk.\"",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump delivered a likely death blow to\u00a0bipartisan congressional budget negotiations, rejecting the measure as full of giveaways to Democrats after billionaire ally Elon Musk whipped up outrage toward the bill and cheered on Republican lawmakers who announced their opposition.",
      "Trump's joint statement Wednesday with Vice President-elect JD Vance stopped the bill in its tracks and punctuated a torrent of social media posts by Musk attacking the legislation for what he described as excessive spending.",
      "\"Stop the steal of your tax dollars!\" Musk wrote on his social media platform X as he dangled primary challenges against anyone who voted for the budget deal, a threat Trump later echoed in a post of his own.",
      "The episode showcased the growing political influence of Musk, a huge campaign donor\u00a0and promoter of Trump-friendly messaging on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he bought in 2022. Trump has selected Musk alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and reduce regulations.",
      "Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky, said his office was flooded with calls from constituents.",
      "\"My phone was ringing off the hook,\" he said. \"The people who elected us are listening to Elon Musk.\"",
      "In addition to keeping the government funded through March, the legislation included $110.4 billion in disaster aid, including $29 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund, which has been depleted in the aftermath of hurricanes Milton and Helene. The 1,500-page bill also included funding to rebuild Baltimore's collapsed Key Bridge, a variety of health care provisions, and a congressional pay raise.",
      "In his statement with Vance, Trump said Republicans should restart negotiations over the legislation, arguing that \"anything else is a betrayal of our country.\" He also called for including an extension of the debt ceiling while President Biden is in office.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" they said. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on a debt ceiling increase now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate over the debt ceiling now.\"",
      "Then, in an interview with CBS News on Thursday, Trump said he thinks \"the debt ceiling should be thrown out entirely.\"",
      "Trump's opposition to what was considered must-pass legislation reinjected a sense of uncertainty and political brinkmanship that was reminiscent of his first term in office. It was a dramatic turn of events for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who negotiated the bill and has been undermined by Trump as he faces reelection for his post in just a couple of weeks. Republicans have a slim majority, raising the possibility of a replay of leadership disputes that paralyzed the House a year ago.",
      "Many lawmakers were in the middle of holiday and year-end celebrations with staff when Trump came out against the legislation.",
      "\"I've been here 14 years, OK? So nothing up here surprises me anymore,\" said Rep. Steve Womack, a senior Republican appropriator from Arkansas. \"We shouldn't be in this mess.\"",
      "The Biden administration criticized the possibility of a shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.",
      "Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a veteran of Washington's budget battles, was concerned about the lack of a clear plan for resolving the dispute.",
      "\"There's got to be a second part of the strategy,\" he said.",
      "Norquist has been enthusiastic about Musk's ability to generate public attention for efforts to reduce the size of government. But he suggested that the owner of a space rocket company wasn't the right person to spearhead a congressional spending debate.",
      "\"He doesn't know politics like he knows physics,\" he said.",
      "But others were thrilled with Musk's involvement.",
      "\"In five years in Congress, I've been awaiting a fundamental change in the dynamic,\" posted Rep. Dan Bishop, a Republican from North Carolina. \"It has arrived.\"",
      "Musk began criticizing the measure as soon as it was released Tuesday evening, and he continuously posted about it Wednesday.",
      "\"Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!\" he wrote. He also called it \"one of the worst bills ever written.\"",
      "Sometimes Musk amplified false claims, such as the idea that the legislation included $3 billion for a new football stadium in Washington. In reality, the legislation would transfer ownership of the land from the federal government to the city, paving the way for eventual development.",
      "That followed a pattern seen in CBS News analysis of his posts during the campaign season, when Musk frequently shared false narratives about the election and amplified extreme voices from the right-wing fringe to his millions of followers.",
      "Musk appeared emboldened by the experience combatting the funding bill.",
      "\"The voice of the people was heard,\" Musk wrote. \"This was a good day for America.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 09:20:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats elect a new party chair on Feb. 1, following the loss of the presidency and the Senate and the narrow failure to win the House in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Martin O'Malley has the kind of experience that would typically benefit a Democrat who wants to guide the party's future after devastating losses in the last election.",
      "He's a former governor, former mayor and a 2016 presidential candidate who until recently was serving in President Biden's administration. Yet O'Malley is facing a difficult path in the race to try and become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee as the party reckons with the reality that key pockets of voters turned against it.",
      "Vital to O'Malley's attempt is a campaign platform, first reported by CBS News, that calls for reconnecting the Democratic Party \"to the kitchen table of every American family.\"",
      "\"We suffered a very bad loss,\" O'Malley said in an interview, urging Democrats \"to learn from it in order to win the next battles ahead.\"",
      "His vision is centered on a 57-state and territory strategy along with plans to give campaigns \"world-class AI tools for voter outreach, research, communications, and financial management, eliminating barriers to effective campaigning.\" O'Malley's pitch is also focused on \"re-investing in direct voter registration,\" as part of his pledge for the party to make \"voter protection and registration the pillars of the change we need to win.\"",
      "Democrats weathered a chaotic election cycle in 2024, punctuated by the push within the party to convince Mr. Biden to end his reelection run after a dismal debate performance in June. While Mr. Biden eventually ended his bid in July and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place at the top of the ticket, the 107-day sprint that followed resulted in Democrats losing the White House and Senate while failing, albeit narrowly, to win control of the House.",
      "Now the party is essentially leaderless and preparing for an emboldened Donald Trump to return to Washington, where he'll be able to benefit from Republicans' unified control of Congress and the White House. Those dynamics will be well in play at the time of the election for DNC chair on Feb. 1 given the unease among Democrats that has been abundantly clear in the weeks following the presidential election.",
      "\"I want to see someone who doesn't come from the Washington circuit, who actually has been out there in the tissue of the country,\" Ohio Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a battleground district Democrat, said of the DNC chair race.",
      "Failure can mean opportunity. The party's struggles means O'Malley, as well as other ambitious Democrats, have a chance to become the next chair and carry wide ranging influence during a critical time for the party as it looks to regain ground in the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. For all his apparent vulnerabilities, Trump was far more successful in this election than ever before, winning all seven presidential battlegrounds. Whether what happened in 2024 will become a tangible turning point for Democrats is likely to loom over the chair race in the coming weeks.",
      "\"That's the big shift that's happened with this election going the wrong way on us,\" O'Malley said. \"We're now in a mode of needing a changemaker, not a caretaker.\"",
      "Among those running for chair, Ken Martin, the leader of Minnesota's arm of the Democratic Party and a DNC vice chair, as well as Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, are seen as frontrunners. Martin has deep relationships within the DNC and can boast a statewide winning streak for candidates in Minnesota, while Wikler carries the political gravitas of helping lead the party in one of the nation's seven presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Earlier this month, Martin announced a framework which includes his drive for a \"Democratic infrastructure in all 3,244 counties,\" across the country, as well as taking on the branding problem evident from the 2024 election results.",
      "\"The majority of Americans now believe the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and the poor, and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and the elites,\" Martin said in his framework. \"It's a damning indictment on our party brand. We must be willing to dig deep and recenter the Democratic agenda to unite families across race, age, background, and class.\"",
      "During a brief pitch to party leaders at a meeting in Washington D.C. last week where Martin and O'Malley also spoke, Wikler told his fellow Democrats \"we need to build the battle plan to change how we communicate, so we show what we mean when we say we fight for working folks.\"",
      "This isn't the first time O'Malley has been linked to leading the party. Days after the 2016 election, he posted on social media that despite encouragement, he would not run for chair. Eight years later, he's navigating a short window to make his case as he emphasizes his lengthy career in politics.",
      "Both Martin and Wikler were deeply involved in the 2024 cycle, and voting to lead the DNC will take place a little under three months removed from Election Day. That dynamic is among the challenges O'Malley faces as he tries to quickly build support among the DNC's relatively small base of voting members. While O'Malley can tout his experience in elected office, both Martin and Wikler are able to point to their work helping lead their respective state parties in 2020 and the crucial elections that happened over the last four years.",
      "But if Democrats are eager to distance themselves broadly from what played out in the last election, O'Malley may be able to capitalize in an attempt to be seen as more of an outsider than his main competitors. And around a month after his bid began, O'Malley's campaign is adamant that he is making a compelling case that is resonating.",
      "\"As it stands today, we know Gov. O'Malley has earned the endorsement of nearly four dozen DNC Members,\" a campaign spokesman said, adding that ahead of the Feb. 1 contest \"we have the momentum in this race.\"",
      "O'Malley served as mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007 and went on to win two terms as governor of Maryland, which included a stint leading the Democratic Governors Association. His political power has faded since then however, illustrated most notably by the struggles he faced during his campaign for president in the 2016 Democratic primary. Before announcing his run for chair, O'Malley spent nearly a year working in the federal government as commissioner of Social Security.",
      "That experience is intertwined in O'Malley's platform, which also calls for creating \"a feedback loop for our local and state elected officials to ensure that they can help inform our messaging and tactics.\"",
      "\"We all know we need to restore our credibility,\" O'Malley said. \"We need to learn from our failings, as well as our candidates who succeeded. But only one of us [in the race for DNC chair] has actually proven an ability to effectuate a rapid turnaround like we need to do right now in order to win the next election.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson scrapped a last-minute measure to avoid a government shutdown late Wednesday after facing opposition from fellow Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 who objected to billions of dollars in spending that had been added to the bill.",
      "Lawmakers are facing a Friday deadline to approve new spending. The measure released Tuesday would have extended funding through March 14, but it also included disaster aid, health care policy extenders and a pay raise for members of Congress, among other provisions. The disaster relief portion of the bill alone carried a price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, confirmed that the\u00a0stopgap funding measure\u00a0is dead and that the path forward is unclear.",
      "\"There's no new agreement right now,\" Scalise said on Capitol Hill after a flurry of activity Wednesday evening.",
      "In a statement\u00a0hours earlier, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance criticized Johnson's approach and said Republicans should pass \"a streamlined spending bill that doesn't give Chuck Schumer and the Democrats everything they want.\" They also called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills.",
      "\"Republicans want to support our farmers, pay for disaster relief, and set our country up for success in 2025. The only way to do that is with a temporary funding bill WITHOUT DEMOCRAT GIVEAWAYS combined with an increase in the debt ceiling,\" they said. \"Anything else is a betrayal of our country.\"",
      "The debt ceiling has not been a part of these negotiations, and Republicans typically oppose increasing it. Trump's decision to inject the issue into shutdown talks added a new dimension to the legislative fight with just two days to go before funding lapses.",
      "\"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch,\" Trump and Vance wrote. \"If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration? Let's have this debate now.\" Under legislation passed in June 2023, the debt ceiling was suspended until the first quarter of 2025.",
      "Republicans turned against the funding plan after a barrage of social media posts by Trump ally Elon Musk lambasting it throughout the day Wednesday.",
      "At the U.S. Capitol, Vance did not answer when asked if he and Trump supported a shutdown.",
      "The Office of Management and Budget told federal agencies to start communicating with employees about shutdown procedures starting at 10am tomorrow, sources familiar told CBS News late Wednesday.",
      "Last Friday, the agencies were told to have their shutdown preparations in order and ready to go.",
      "The continuing resolution",
      "When it was unveiled on Tuesday, the spending legislation immediately sparked anger from multiple members of the House Republican conference, mostly targeted at Johnson. While the speaker had pledged to avoid the kind of massive, end-of-year spending bills that conservatives loathe, the final product resembled a scaled-down version of what the party's right flank has railed against for years now.",
      "But the Republicans' slim majority in the House means Johnson would have needed Democratic votes to pass the bill, a dynamic that gave the minority more leverage to extract concessions during negotiations. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hinted at Democrats' influence amid reports that Johnson could scale back the bill, writing in a post on X: \"You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.\"",
      "\"Republicans have now unilaterally decided to break a bipartisan agreement that they made,\" Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters Wednesday night. \"House Republicans will now own any harm that is visited upon the American people that results from a government shutdown or worse. An agreement is an agreement. It was bipartisan. And there is nothing more to say.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also called on Republicans to \"keep their word.\"",
      "\"Republicans need to stop playing politics with this bipartisan agreement or they will hurt hardworking Americans and create instability across the country,\" she said in statement.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, acknowledged that the bill was intended to be \"very skinny\" before a \"couple of intervening things\" occurred, citing the devastation left by hurricanes earlier this year.",
      "Before the text of the bill was released, Johnson dismissed Republican concerns that the continuing resolution was equivalent to an \"omnibus\" bill, a term used when Congress packages the annual appropriations bills that fund many federal government agencies into one large piece of legislation.",
      "\"This is not an omnibus, OK?\" Johnson said at his weekly news conference on Tuesday. \"This is a small [continuing resolution] that we had to add things to that were out of our control. These are not man-made disasters. These are things that the federal government has an appropriate role to do.\"",
      "Johnson had also vowed to give members 72 hours to read the bill before a vote, but lawmakers said they were expecting a vote as soon as Wednesday, which would give them less than 24 hours to get through the nearly 1,550-page text. The path forward was cast into doubt by Trump's statement, with speculation growing that Johnson would scrap the original version of the bill and bring up a narrower funding extension that includes disaster relief.",
      "Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, on Tuesday called the process \"a total dumpster fire.\" He said he was \"disappointed\" in Johnson and called on him to \"communicate better.\" Other members, like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, have dubbed the bill the \"Cramnibus.\" Rep. Kat Cammack, a Florida Republican, said the measure was \"a band-aid that is laced with fentanyl.\"",
      "\"There's a certain sandwich that's made of feces, and that's what I would compare this to,\" said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, also of Florida. She argued that pairing disaster relief with the measure puts members in a tough spot. \"This is a s**t sandwich. I don't know how else to say that we're being forced into this position.\"",
      "The fight could prompt a challenge to Johnson's speakership when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he won't support Johnson in the speaker's election.",
      "\"I'm not voting for him,\" Massie said. \"This solidifies it.\"",
      "Massie said he's spoken with other members who have a similar stance.",
      "Johnson ran into a buzzsaw of opposition outside the House as well. Musk, the co-head of Trump's advisory Department of Government Efficiency, said in a post on X that any lawmaker \"who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years.\" Musk posted dozens of times throughout the day calling for lawmakers to oppose the bill, which he called \"criminal.\"",
      "The speaker told Fox News earlier in the day that he had discussed the situation with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the other DOGE co-head, on Tuesday evening. Johnson said he emphasized to them that passing a continuing resolution now would be \"clearing the decks\" and allow the incoming GOP majorities to \"put our fingerprints on the spending\" in March.",

      "The U.S. formally submitted its new goal Thursday to the United Nations. It calls for a 61% to 66% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels, the White House said, with an overarching goal of achieving net zero emissions by no later than 2050.",
      "The new goal is part of the Paris Agreement, under which member nations must update their emission cut targets \u2014 known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs \u2014 every five years.",
      "The Paris accord requires countries to set voluntary targets for reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. The only binding requirement is that nations accurately report on their efforts. First signed in 2016 by nearly 200 nations, it seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The new climate commitment \"marks an ambitious capstone to President Biden's climate legacy,\" the White House said in a news release, adding that it will help grow a new clean energy economy focused on investment, innovation, and jobs.",
      "\"The United States' new climate commitment offers a clear path forward for states, cities, businesses, and other leaders dedicated to ramping up action over the next four years,\" said Debbie Weyl, U.S. acting director for the nonprofit environmental group the World Resource Institute, in a statement. \"Even though the Trump administration may not lift a finger to deliver on this plan, it sets a north star for what the U.S. should be aiming for and could help guide the federal government's priorities once Trump leaves office in 2029,\" Weyl said.",
      "In 2017, then-President Trump announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, a process which took until nearly the end of his first term to complete. However, Mr. Biden fulfilled a campaign vow by rejoining the Paris Agreement on the first day of his own administration in early 2021.",
      "Trump has long championed the fossil fuel industry, questioned the science of climate change and weakened other environmental protections.",
      "This year, his campaign said Trump would pull the U.S. from the Paris Agreement\u00a0a second time.",
      "Last month in Azerbaijan at the annual United Nations climate summit known as COP29, participants adopted a $300 billion annual deal that will go towards helping developing countries wean themselves off coal, oil and gas, and help them adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change's extreme weather.",

      "The House passed the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act in a bipartisan 373-33 vote Wednesday, after the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent earlier in the week. It's a cause that's personal to Hilton, who says she was abused at residential treatment facilities as a teen. Hilton lived in a series of residential treatment facilities from the age of 16, testifying before Congress in June that she had been violently restrained, stripped of clothing and tossed into solitary confinement, among other experiences.",

This moment is proof that our voices matter, that speaking out can spark change, and that no child should ever endure the horrors of abuse in silence. I did this for the younger version of myself and the youth who were senselessly taken from us by the Troubled Teen Industry.\"",

      "Last week the Commerce Department issued a notice to China Telecom Americas, the U.S. subsidiary of one of China's largest communications firms, alleging in a preliminary finding that its presence in American telecom networks and cloud services poses a national security risk. The company has 30 days to respond, although the Commerce Department has not said what action it plans to take next.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report the action, which is a direct response to China's infiltration of telecom networks earlier this year. The China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon penetrated the networks of numerous companies including Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies,\u00a0a U.S. official familiar with the matter told to CBS News in October.",
      "It's unclear what the impact on China Telecom would be, since the\u00a0FCC has already limited\u00a0China Telecom Americas' ability to operate in U.S. communications infrastructure. In October 2021, the FCC\u00a0revoked\u00a0its license to provide phone services in the US.",

    "story": [
      "Construction worker, gardener, waiter, painter, realtor \u2014 these are the jobs Mardoel Hernandez has held as a Honduran immigrant living in the U.S. for over 20 years. Hernandez, a teacher who fled his home country in the 1990s, was granted legal status and a work permit under the Temporary Protection Status program.",
      "The program, created by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, allows immigrants to temporarily remain in the U.S. if they're from countries designated as unsafe. TPS allows migrants to apply for work permits and shields them from deportation, but does not offer a pathway to citizenship.",
      "Now, Hernandez is joining other TPS holders across the country in a hunger strike to pressure Mr. Biden to extend protected status for immigrants at risk for deportation, since President-elect Donald Trump has promised to revoke the program upon taking office.",
      "\"We are asking President Biden to leave a strong legacy among the immigrant community and honor his word,\" Hernandez told CBS News. \"He promised us so much.\"",
      "As part of the hunger strike organized by the National TPS Alliance organization, immigrants say until Mr. Biden responds, they will abstain from food in sympathy with the deprivation experienced in their home countries.",
      "\"In 2017, I began packing my bags when Trump canceled TPS for Hondurans.\" Hernandez said. \"My only option now is to rally and hope that Biden will notice and act.\"",
      "During an interview in October with NewsNation, Trump was asked about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, and whether he'd revoke TPS.",
      "\"Absolutely, I'd revoke it, and I'd bring them back to their country,\" he responded. This followed debunked claims from Trump on the campaign trail that Haitian immigrants living in Springfield were killing and eating pets of local residents.",
      "\"President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump transition spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement, when asked what Trump plans to do with TPS holders and whether these immigrants would be part of his overall deportation plans.",
      "\"The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness. He will deliver.\" Leavitt said. But she did not address what the Trump administration plans to do with migrants who have temporary legal U.S. status.",
      "According to the latest data, there are over 850,000 TPS holders, as of March 2024. Around 350,000 Venezuelans, 200,000 Haitians and 180,000 Salvadorans make up the largest group of beneficiaries.",
      "Approximately 300,000 TPS holders reside in Florida, while Texas has nearly 95,000, and New York and California each have around 68,000.",
      "TPS holders are provided renewable relief for up to six, 12 or 18 months, but without an extension, many will begin losing their legal status in 2025. Protections for Salvadorans are set to expire first in March, with Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan in April, and Nicraragua in July.",
      "\"It is very important that anybody who is under Temporary Protection Status sits down with an attorney to evaluate every possible avenue to obtain a permanent status, or to change status, and figure it out,\" said Haim Vasquez, an immigration lawyer in Dallas, Texas. \"If there's anything that can be done, they must do it sooner than later.\"",
      "Since Trump won the election, Vasquez says he has been taking questions at the Salvadoran consulate in Dallas from TPS holders who will be among the first to see their status expire in March.",
      "Extensions, known as designations, for TPS are announced two months before the expiration date, Vasquez said. In this case, Biden would have to issue a new designation for Salvadorans by Jan. 9.",
      "As for how much time immigrants would have in the country before they face deportation if Trump were to fulfill his promises and revoke TPS, Vasquez says it depends on how Trump terminates the program. He could allow the status to run through expiration dates previously set; any revocation is sure to be met with lawsuits.",
      "\"A hundred percent, we expect that there will be legal challenges,\" Vasquez said.",
      "During his first administration, Trump tried to terminate TPS for beneficiaries from six countries, including Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan. Trump's attempts, however, were immediately met with legal challenges, and a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the TPS terminations.",
      "With critical deadlines looming, on Dec. 9, a group of senators sent a letter to Mr. Biden urging him to protect long-settled immigrants before Trump's inauguration with key action steps.",
      "Sens. Dick Durbin, Cory Booker, Catherine Cortez Masto, Tammy Duckworth, Mazie Hirono, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Alex Padilla asked the president to redesignate and extend TPS for all eligible countries. The senators stressed that \"worsening crises across the world,\" including in Ukraine and Nicaragua, underscore the need for continuing the protected status.",
      "Currently, the U.S. has conferred the status on nationals of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Nepa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ukraine.",
      "Soledad Miranda, a Salvadoran TPS holder, also joined the hunger strike in Washington, D.C., urging Mr. Biden to issue an extension before he leaves office. She fears deportation and being separated from her U.S.-born daughter.",

    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

      "Humans aren't alone when it comes to yawning\u00a0\u2014 all vertebrates do it too, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. But why?",
      "The \"evolutionarily ancient\" act of yawning likely serves a few purposes, according to Andrew Gallup, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\"The fact that it is conserved so widely across the animal kingdom suggests that it likely holds an evolutionary function, and research suggests that it functions in a variety of domains,\" he said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0Friday.",
      "Those findings suggest yawning may have a role in promoting changes in our state of alertness or activity patterns.",
      "\"We often yawn frequently before we go to sleep or after we wake up,\" Gallup said. \"Yawns have been shown to increase arousal and alertness as associated with these state changes.\"",
      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",
      "\"It helps promote mental awareness and alertness. So when individuals yawn in an academic setting or a boardroom, it could be an indicator that they're actually trying to pay attention,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

    "title": "\"Murder hornets\" eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials say",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Dec 2024 16:10:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Giant hornets, dubbed \"murder hornets,\" have been eradicated in the U.S., five years after the invasive species was first detected in Washington state.",
    "story": [
      "The Northern giant hornet, more commonly known as the \"murder hornet,\" has been eradicated in the U.S., agriculture officials said Wednesday.",
      "The ominously nicknamed invasive species was confirmed to be in the U.S. in 2019 after officials in Washington state received and verified two reports of the hornet. Efforts quickly began to track and get rid of them.",
      "The 2-inch-long hornet, with a stinger longer than that of a typical wasp, can deliver potent venom, but is largely dangerous to bees and other insects, not humans. Eradication efforts started because of the threat the hornet posed to bees and agriculture across the country.",
      "\"By tackling this threat head-on, we protected not only pollinators and crops, but also the industries, communities, and ecosystems that depend on them,\" Dr. Mark Davidson, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a news statement.",
      "How \"murder hornets\" were eradicated",
      "State, federal and international government agencies worked together to eradicate \"murder hornets\" in the U.S., the officials said.",
      "To do so, first entomologists had to find the hornets' nests.\u00a0Finding the nests can be a challenge, because the hornets typically build their nests in forested areas, often in an underground cavity, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In some cases, entomologists captured a live hornet, attached a radio tag to it, released it, and tracked the hornet back to its nest. Figuring out how to securely attach a radio tag to a hornet without harming it was a hurdle.",
      "After finding a nest in a tree, a team plugged the nest with foam, wrapped the tree in plastic and vacuumed out the hornets. They also injected carbon dioxide into the tree to kill any remaining hornets.",
      "In 2022, scientists said they were setting about 1,000 hornet traps in Washington. Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The previous year, Washington state officials destroyed a nest, finding nearly 1,500 hornets \"in various stages of development.\"",
      "The public also helped officials track down hornet nests. If not for help from the public, there's a good chance that the hornet could have been around for years to come, Sven Spichiger, Washington State Department of Agriculture pest program manager, said during a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"All of our nest detections resulted directly or indirectly from public reports,\" Spichiger said in a press release. \"And half of our confirmed detections came from the public.",
      "Could the hornet come back to the U.S.?",
      "While officials in Washington celebrated the eradication of the invasive hornet species, Spichiger acknowledged they could come back to the U.S. He said officials would continue to keep an eye out for the hornet and encouraged members of the community to do the same.",
      "\"They got here once and they could do it again,\" Spichiger said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that it was unclear how the hornets first arrived in the U.S., though invasive species can be \"unwitting hitchhikers\" on things like shipping containers.",
      "Even now, five years after the hornets appeared in the U.S., Spichiger said officials will never know exactly how they got to the country.",
      "What makes \"murder hornets\" unique?",
      "The hornet, an invasive species from Asia, can kill an entire hive of honeybees in as little as 90 minutes, according to agriculture officials.",
      "\"The hornets can enter a 'slaughter phase' where they kill entire hives by decapitating the bees. The hornets then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,\" according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. \"They also attack other insects but are not known to destroy entire colonies of those insects.\"",
      "The hornets typically only attack people or pets when threatened, but can sting repeatedly.",
      "The hornet species has a large orange or yellow head and black-and-orange stripes across its body.",
      "They were first detected in North America in British Columbia, Canada ,in August 2019, authorities said, and then were confirmed in Washington state by the end of 2019.",
      "When the species first arrived in the U.S., it was known as the Asian giant hornet. But in July of 2022, the Entomological Society of America adopted \"Northern giant hornet\" as the common name for the species. The organization also adopted the names Southern giant hornet as the name for a closely related species.",
      "\"Common names are an important tool for entomologists to communicate with the public about insects and insect science,\" organization President Jessica Ware said at the time. \"Northern giant hornet is both scientifically accurate and easy to understand, and it avoids evoking fear or discrimination.\"",
      "While the U.S. appears to have gotten rid of them, at least for now, scientists in Spain last month reported sightings of the hornet species in Europe. They described two sightings of the hornet in the journal Ecology and Evolution.",

      "Despite calls to halt humanity's burning of the filthiest fossil fuel driving climate change, the energy watchdog expects global demand for coal to hit record highs for the third year in a row.",
      "Scientists have warned that planet-warming greenhouse gases will have to be drastically slashed to limit global heating to avoid catastrophic impacts on the Earth and humanity.",

      "Published on Wednesday, the IEA's \"Coal 2024\" report does, however, predict the world will hit peak coal use in 2027 after topping 8.77 billion tons this year.",
      "But that would be dependent on China, which for the past quarter-century has consumed 30 percent more coal than the rest of the world's countries combined, the IEA said.",
      "China's demand for electricity was the most significant driving force behind the increase, with more than a third of coal burnt worldwide carbonized in that country's power plants.",
      "Though Beijing has sought to diversify its electricity sources, including a massive expansion of solar and wind power, the IEA said China's coal demand in 2024 will still hit 4.9 billion tones \u2014 itself another record.",
      "Increasing coal demand in China, as well as in emerging economies such as India and Indonesia, made up for a continued decline in advanced economies.",
      "However that decline has slowed in the European Union and the United States. Coal use there is set to decline by 12 and five percent respectively, compared with 23 and 17 percent in 2023.",
      "With the imminent return to the White House of Donald Trump \u2014 who has repeatedly called climate change a \"hoax\" \u2014 many scientists fear that a second Trump presidency would water down the climate commitments of the world's largest economy.",
      "Coal mining also hit unprecedented levels by topping nine billion tons in output for the first time, the IEA said, with top producers China, India and Indonesia all posting new production records.",
      "The energy watchdog warned that the explosion in power-hungry data centers powering the emergence of artificial intelligence was likewise likely to drive up demand for power generation, with that trend underpinning electricity demand in coal-guzzling China.",
      "The 2024 report reverses the IEA's prediction last year that coal use would begin declining after peaking in 2023.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate change forum in Dubai last year, nations vowed to transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "But its follow-up this year ended in acrimony, with experts warning that the failure to double down on that landmark pledge at COP29 in Azerbaijan risked jeopardizing efforts to fight climate change.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

    "story": [
      "NASA researchers combined years of data and new imaging techniques to learn more about a \"tipped over\" black hole that is moving in an unexpected way.",
      "The black hole is located in a galaxy called NGC 5084. Researchers have been aware of the galaxy for years, NASA said in a news release.",
      "New analysis techniques developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California helped researchers see four long plumes of plasma emanating from the galaxy. Most galaxies don't have plumes, and when they do, only one or two are present. The plumes suggested the galaxy might house a supermassive black hole, NASA said. Spotting both pairs, which formed an \"X\" shape, led researchers to focus more on the area.",
      "Using archived data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Telescope based in Chile, researchers found that the galaxy also had a \"small, dusty inner disk\" rotating at the center of the galaxy, again suggesting a black hole there. Even more surprisingly, both the disk and black hole were rotating at a 90-degree angle relative to the rest of the galaxy, meaning both features are essentially \"lying on their sides,\" NASA said.",
      "\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" said research scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff, who will also publish a paper about the discovery, in the news release. \"Putting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"",
      "It's not clear what caused the change in the galaxy. It may have collided with another galaxy and formed a chimney of superheated gas, creating the X-shaped plasma plumes. Further research will have to be conducted to learn more about the circumstances.",

    "story": [
      "Two NASA astronauts who flew up to the International Space Station in a Boeing Starliner capsule for a round trip that was supposed to last just over a week will be stuck in space for closer to a year before they can come home. Despite the astronauts' longer-than-expected stay at the space station, officials have insisted that Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore aren't stranded in space.",
      "Here's what we know about the stuck astronauts:",
      "Why are the astronauts stuck in space?",
      "Williams and Wilmore blasted off to the space station in June. Their mission was supposed to take between eight and 10 days, but helium leaks in the capsule's propulsion system and degraded thrusters, which are important for re-entry, upended plans for bringing the astronauts back to Earth.",
      "\"Eight days to eight months or nine months or 10 months, whatever it is, we're going to do the very best job we can do every single day,\" Wilmore told CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann in September. At the time, they were expected to leave the space station in late February 2025.",
      "The capsule safely returned to Earth in September with no one onboard.",
      "Who are the astronauts who are stuck in space?",
      "Williams turned 59 on the space station in September. She joined NASA in 1998 after serving in the Navy for over a decade, retiring as a captain. As a naval aviator, she logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. At NASA, she had set a record for women with four spacewalks lasting a total of 29 hours, 17 minutes, but it was broken by Peggy Whitson with her fifth spacewalk in 2008.",
      "Wilmore also retired from the Navy as a captain, recording over 8,000 flight hours as a naval aviator. During Operation Desert Storm in Iraq in 1991, Wilmore flew 21 combat missions. He joined NASA in 2000 and accumulated 178 days in space before the Starliner mission. Like Williams, he has also performed four spacewalks, totaling 25 hours, 36 minutes.",
      "Why did the Boeing Starliner crew go to the International Space Station in the first place?",
      "The June launch was the Starliner's first piloted test flight. NASA has funded the development of the capsule and SpaceX's Crew Dragon as the space agency looks to stop using Russian Soyuz flights to transport astronauts to and from the space station.",
      "When will the astronauts be able to return to Earth?",
      "On Tuesday, Dec. 17, NASA announced Williams and Wilmore would return to Earth after the agency's new SpaceX crew arrives at the space station. That won't happen until late March at the earliest so NASA and SpaceX can have more time to finish a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission, NASA said.",
      "Have other astronauts been stuck in the International Space Station before?",

    "story": [
      "Outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wednesday he is optimistic SpaceX founder Elon Musk's relationship with President-Elect Donald Trump will help ensure NASA receives the funding needed to support a robust agenda, including returning U.S. astronauts to the moon.",
      "Trump has nominated billionaire Jared Isaacman, veteran of two SpaceX Crew Dragon flights to low-Earth orbit, to serve as NASA's next administrator, prompting speculation Musk's connections to both men might give him even more influence over NASA space policy than he currently wields.",
      "\"On the one hand, I am optimistic because of the relationship that Musk has with Trump that NASA will get the funding that it needs because Musk will be advocating,\" Nelson said in an interview with CBS News. \"On the other hand, if Musk were to want to cut out other companies in the competition for rockets, that would not be a good thing. And I think Musk is smarter than that.\"",
      "SpaceX already delivers cargo to the International Space Station with its unpiloted Dragon capsules and ferries astronauts to and from the outpost aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Critical to the Artemis moon program, SpaceX also is building a variant of its Starship rocket to carry astronauts back to the lunar surface in 2027. It will be NASA's first such landing since the final Apollo mission in 1972.",
      "Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, also is building a moon lander for NASA, giving the agency alternatives in case one company's spacecraft is grounded for some reason.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX is \"the horse that we're going to ride, and we're expecting that horse to be able to run and run fast,\" Nelson said. \"And if not, we've got another horse and it's called Blue Origin.\"",
      "At Nelson insistence shortly after taking office, NASA held a second competition for a second lunar lander \"based on the principle that you want to have two spacecraft in case something happens to one of them,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"If ever there's been a demonstration of the wisdom of having two competitors, it was for the cargo and crew to the space station.\"",
      "NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing to build commercial crew ferry ships in the wake of the space shuttle's retirement in 2011.",
      "While SpaceX has successfully launched 10 sets of astronauts and cosmonauts to the station aboard Crew Dragon capsules, along with five purely commercial flights to orbit, Boeing's Starliner spacecraft has carried just two crew members to the lab.",
      "Commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams took off on Boeing's first piloted Starliner test flight June 5. The mission was expected to last eight to 10 days, but thruster problems and propellant leaks combined to extend the crew's stay aboard the ISS while engineers carried out extensive testing.",
      "In the end, NASA decided to bring the Starliner down without its crew, switching Wilmore and Williams to a Crew Dragon and delaying their return to Earth until mid February. On Tuesday, NASA announced launch of the next Crew Dragon, carrying a replacement ISS crew, is slipping to at least the end of March.",
      "That means Wilmore and Williams will log an additional month and a half in orbit before finally coming home after 10 months in space. Asked if he had any words of encouragement for the Starliner astronauts, Nelson said simply \"they are true professionals, as are all of our astronauts, and they meet whatever is the need of NASA.\"",
      "Future of NASA's Artemis moon program",
      "The Isaacman nomination has prompted speculation in some quarters that NASA's Artemis moon program, relying on the agency's costly Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, could face major changes, including a possible switch from the SLS to SpaceX's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Nelson said a different rocket might be used in the 2030s, but the SLS is the only choice available for moon flights through the end of the current decade.",
      "\"Understand, that there is currently one human-rated rocket that has been to the moon and back, and that is SLS,\" Nelson said.",
      "NASA launched the first SLS on the program's maiden flight in 2021, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back. The second SLS is being prepared for launch in the April 2026 timeframe to send four astronauts on a similar out-and-back-again trip around the moon.",
      "After that, the Artemis 3 mission is tentatively targeted for launch in 2027.

    "story": [
      "Two astronauts who traveled to the International Space Station aboard Boeing's troubled Starliner more than six months ago will not return to Earth until at least March 2025, NASA announced Tuesday.",
      "Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams traveled to the space station aboard the Starliner back in June. Their trip was initially only to last about eight to 10 days, but multiple issues with the Starliner prompted a concerned NASA, out of caution, to leave them behind at the space station and return the capsule to Earth empty in September.",
      "That same month, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule with a reduced two-person crew and two empty seats launched to the space station with the intention of returning Wilmore and Williams aboard it in February 2025.",
      "However, NASA said in a news release Tuesday that Wilmore and Williams' replacements, traveling aboard the SpaceX Crew-10, would be launching to the space station \"no earlier than late March 2025,\" meaning that would be the earliest that Wilmore and Williams will return to Earth.",
      "The most recent delay in the Crew-10's launch is to give \"NASA and SpaceX teams time to complete processing on a new Dragon spacecraft for the mission.\"",
      "The Crew-9 \u2014 carrying Williams, Wilmore, fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov \u2014 can only leave the space station following a \"handover period\" with the Crew-10.",
      "The handover period \"allows Crew-9 to share any lessons learned with the newly arrived crew and support a better transition for ongoing science and maintenance at the complex.\"",
      "NASA did not speculate on how long that handover might take.",
      "The Starliner, Boeing's answer to the Crew Dragon, has faced major headwinds since it went into development, including a series of technical issues and budget shortfalls.",
      "It finally launched, but after arriving at the space station with its crew, multiple helium leaks were discovered in the Starliner's propulsion system, along with a degraded thrust in five of its maneuvering jets.",
      "A return in late March or April would mean that a trip that was expected to last just over a week for Williams and Wilmore   will have been stretched to at least nine months.",
      "\"Fabrication, assembly, testing, and final integration of a new spacecraft is a painstaking endeavor that requires great attention to detail,\" Steve Stich, manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement Tuesday about the Crew-10. \"We appreciate the hard work by the SpaceX team to expand the Dragon fleet in support of our missions and the flexibility of the station program and expedition crews as we work together to complete the new capsule's readiness for flight.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

    "summary": "Scammers are using AI-powered voice-cloning tools to prey on people. But experts say there's a simple way to protect you and your family.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",
      "\"So much of it is based on psychology and hacking the limbic system,\" Chuck Herrin, field chief information security officer for F5, a security and fraud prevention firm, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They say things that trigger a fear-based emotional response because they know when humans get afraid, we get stupid and don't exercise the best judgment.\"",
      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" James Scobey, chief information security officer at Keeper Security told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The vote came down to the wire, as the Senate looked to wrap up its current session. Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order late Friday night that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class.

The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",

    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

The warning came before the House passed a last-minute stopgap funding bill with bipartisan support Friday night, sending it to the Senate ahead of the deadline.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Mayorkas said many components of the Department of Homeland Security would be affected by a lapse in funding, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), FEMA and Border Patrol.",
      "The homeland security chief added that a failure by lawmakers to pass a stopgap spending bill before Saturday would also mean staff at the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office would be redirected to other parts of his department.",
      "\"The implications and the consequences are serious, especially when it comes to Homeland Security,\" Mayorkas said.",
      "He urged Congress to approve legislation that would keep government agencies operating before midnight, when a short-term extension enacted in September will expire.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled earlier this week a legislative package negotiated with Democrats that would have extended government funding through March 14, provided more than $100 billion in disaster aid for states impacted by extreme weather events, and given members of Congress a pay raise, among other provisions.",
      "But the proposal was swiftly met with pushback from some conservative Republicans, who balked at the size and scope of the 1,550 page deal. Crucially, it was also criticized by billionaire Elon Musk, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, and then by the incoming president himself.",
      "Trump and Musk torpedoed the package, with Musk taking to X, the social media platform he owns, to lambaste provisions of it. The president-elect further upended negotiations over a funding deal when he called on Republicans to address the debt limit \u2014 which is set to be reinstated Jan. 1 \u2014 in their plan.",
      "Johnson unveiled a second measure Thursday, which would have funded the government for three months, suspended the nation's borrowing limit until January 2027 and provided $110 billion in disaster relief. The more tailored legislation, which Trump backed, also included health care provisions, a one-year renewal of the farm bill and funding for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which collapsed in March.",
      "But that package failed to pass the House with the necessary support after it was opposed by most Democrats and more than three dozen Republicans.",

The warm and above-average temperatures in the weather forecast across the continental U.S. for Christmas week of 2024 are expected to keep any precipitation that falls as rain, not snow, for many parts of the country.",

Interstate travel will be hazardous through parts of I-15, I-90, I-84, I-94 and I-75.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Friday confirmed two more of President Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday, giving him a total of 235 since he took office, surpassing\u00a0the number of judges approved for lifetime appointment during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The confirmation of Benjamin Cheeks to the federal district court in Southern California was followed by the confirmation of Serena Murillo to the federal district court in Central California.",
      "As he nears the end of his presidency, Mr. Biden will close out his four years in office having appointed one Supreme Court justice, 45 judges to the federal appeals courts, 187 to the district courts and two to the Court of International Trade. His selection of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made history, since she is the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"Today, we celebrate one of the most important accomplishments of this Democratic Senate and the Biden-Harris administration: the confirmation of highly qualified, independent, and evenhanded judges to the federal bench,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement, adding, \"More than one out of every four judges now serving on the judicial bench was nominated by President Biden.\"",
      "Mr. Biden has also selected a record number of public defenders to serve as federal judges on the appeals courts, and his nominees are the most diverse compared to those tapped by his predecessors.",
      "There's been heightened focus on the judiciary by presidents in recent years as gridlock in Congress has led to unilateral executive actions on a variety of issues touching on American life. But often those efforts give way to legal challenges, leaving courts as the final deciders in disputes over hot-button policies.",
      "While Mr. Biden will likely end his presidency with more judicial appointments than Trump, he did not see the same level of success as his predecessor in putting his stamp on the Supreme Court. Jackson replaced Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the court's liberal wing, following his retirement in 2022.",
      "But Trump named three justices to the high court, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett replaced the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal member, which locked in a 6-3 conservative supermajority.",

      "But Trump had an advantage when he took office in 2017, inheriting 17 appellate court vacancies after the Republican-led Senate blocked then-President Barack Obama's nominees in the last two years of his term. When Mr. Biden started his presidency, there were just two open seats on the courts of appeals.",
      "With a second Trump term on the horizon, some judges who announced their plans to retire have reversed course as it became clear their replacements wouldn't be confirmed before Jan. 3, when Republicans will assume control of the Senate.",
      "Judge James Wynn of the 4th Circuit notified Mr. Biden last week that he would no longer assume senior status, a form of semi-retirement, and the White House withdrew the nomination of his possible successor, North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park.",
      "North Carolina's Republican senators, Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, opposed Park's nomination, and Tillis lambasted Wynn's decision to walk back his retirement, calling it \"brazenly partisan\" and driven by Trump's election.",
      "Two district court judges appointed by Democratic presidents, Judges Max Cogburn and Algenon Marbley, also rescinded their plans to take senior status following Trump's victory, according to Reuters.",
      "The reversals come after Senate Democrats reached a deal with Republicans to allow for swifter consideration of Mr. Biden's district court picks. GOP senators \u2014 with Trump's backing \u2014 had been working to slow the pace of judicial confirmations during the lame-duck session, but under the deal, they would forego procedural roadblocks on district court nominees if Democrats would not bring four remaining appellate court nominations up for a vote.",

    "story": [
      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S., as the House appeared to have averted a government shutdown late Friday.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \"continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\" spokesperson Diaz said. \"Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\"",
      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

The bill is expected to pass in the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",

      "\"A prolonged government shutdown threatens holiday travel disruptions that Americans won't tolerate,\" Geoff Freeman, the group's CEO, said in a statement. \"It's hard to see how anyone in Congress wins if they force TSA workers, air traffic controllers and other essential employees to work without pay during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.\"",
      "A survey by the group also found that 60% of Americans said they would consider changing their travel plans if a government shutdown occurs, including canceling flights and trips altogether, resulting in significant economic losses for travel-related businesses.",
      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another.

      "Americans are expected to spend more money heating their homes this winter than on holiday gifts, according to new research.",
      "The elevated cost of staying warm indoors amid cold outdoor temperatures comes after an unusually hot summer, that led to households spending bigger shares of their budgets on cooling costs, compared with previous years, according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

      "The payments will vary by person, with a maximum amount of $1,400 per recipient, the agency said in a statement.",

      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",
      "Most taxpayers who were eligible for the stimulus payments have already received them directly, or later through the recovery rebate credit.",
      "Do you need to apply for the IRS payment?",
      "No. The IRS said it's sending the payments automatically to about 1 million people who filed tax returns and who qualified for the recovery rebate credit yet didn't claim it. The agency will send a letter to recipients to let them know they will receive the payment.",

Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",

      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",

      "Hollywood powerhouses Tyler Perry and Kerry Washington have joined forces to tell the remarkable story of the 6888th Postal Battalion, which was the only women's Army Corps unit of color to be stationed in Europe during World War II. Perry \u2014 who wrote, directed and produced the film \u2014 describes \"Six Triple Eight\" as an important chapter in U.S. history.",
      "The film centers on the women of the 6888th who were sent to Europe with the daunting task of delivering a backlog of nearly 17 million pieces of mail to U.S. soldiers and their families. The women not only completed the mission, but did so in just 90 days, defying expectations. Kerry Washington stars as Major Charity Adams, the real-life commanding officer of the unit and the highest-ranking Black female officer during the war.",
      "At Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall near Washington, D.C., Perry and Washington discussed the significance of sharing this story.",
      "Washington's portrayal of Adams was a key part of the project. Perry explained his choice of Washington for the role, saying, \"I thought, 'Let's show the world that there's something so different here from you. I know they know Olivia Pope. But when we're done, they're going to see no one but Charity Adams.'\"",
      "The film also brought intense moments of historical reflection. Perry recounted a personal encounter with Lena King, one of the last surviving members of the 6888th, who was 99 years old at the time and home on hospice.",
      "\"I actually wanted all of the surviving members to see it,\" he said. \"Lena was the only one who got a chance to. I rushed a cut together and bought it to her.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:46:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:56:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Her father John Ramsey said DNA testing on items like a blanket and a rope could point to the killer.",
    "story": [
      "The details of the murder are still shocking today, nearly three decades later. On Dec. 26, 1996, the 6-year-old daughter of John and Patsy Ramsey, a well-to-do couple living in Boulder, Colorado, was found dead in the family's basement. JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, an outgoing child who performed in local beauty pageants, had been bludgeoned and strangled.",
      "It is a story I began covering for \"48 Hours\" in 1999 and will return to in \"The Search for JonBen\u00e9t's Killer\" airing Saturday, Dec. 21 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. The program is a look back at how we covered the case in 2002. It's a television time capsule, allowing viewers to hear Patsy and John Ramsey talk about their daughter and how her death and the following investigation upended their lives.",
      "Shortly before 6 a.m. on the morning after Christmas, Patsy Ramsey called 911. She had awakened, she later told police, to find her daughter missing and a two-and-a-half-page note left on the stairs demanding a $118,000 ransom.",
      "Despite a written warning not to notify anyone, the Ramseys called Boulder police, who searched their home and recommended the family wait for a call from the kidnappers. Later that day, a Boulder detective suggested John Ramsey and a family friend look through the home to see if anything looked out of place. When John Ramsey entered a room in the basement, he found his daughter dead on the floor, with a white blanket over her body and duct tape across her mouth.",
      "The tragic discovery of the child by her own father, after officers had already searched the home, was the beginning of a yearslong, error-plagued investigation. JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey's murder was the first homicide that year in Boulder.",
      "The case, after the acquittal of football star O.J. Simpson, immediately became the next international media sensation. Pictures of the photogenic 6-year-old competing in child beauty pageants appeared in the tabloids, while armchair detectives filled the airwaves, debating the contents of the ransom note.",
      "Unidentified male DNA was left on the child and tests, performed just weeks after the murder, excluded anyone from the Ramsey family, including JonBenet's 9-year-old brother\u00a0Burke. Those results were initially kept from the press and public as investigators continued to focus mostly on John and Patsy Ramsey as suspects in their daughter's murder.",
      "While the couple gave DNA, hair, blood and writing samples in the days following the murder, they hired attorneys and didn't speak to investigators until several months later, in April 1997, and again in June 1998. Video from that 1998 interrogation, aired publicly for the first time by \"48 Hours,\" shows a combative Patsy Ramsey denying any involvement in her daughter's murder. When told that investigators had scientific trace evidence linking her, she responded, \"That is totally impossible. Go retest.\" She then added, \"I don't give a flying flip how scientific it is. Go back to the damn drawing board. I didn't do it. John Ramsey didn't do it. So we all got to start working together from here, this day forward to try to find out who the hell did it.\"",
      "In 2008, after more DNA tests again excluded the Ramsey family, the Boulder District Attorney at that time, Mary Lacy, publicly exonerated the Ramseys and sent them a letter of apology.",
      "Investigators considered the theory that JonBen\u00e9t may have been killed by an intruder, and over the years, looked at other persons of interest, including a neighbor who played Santa Claus and at least two people who confessed to the murder.",
      "The only arrest in the case was made in 2006 after a man living in Thailand by the name of John Mark Karr claimed to have drugged, sexually assaulted and accidentally killed JonBen\u00e9t. No drugs, however, had been found in the child and Karr's DNA did not match what was left at the scene. Karr was later released.",
      "Patsy Ramsey never lived to see the Boulder district attorney's apology or have her name cleared. In 2006, she died, at age 49, of ovarian cancer. But John Ramsey, who remarried in 2011, has continued to push the Boulder police to find and arrest his daughter's killer.",
      "If JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey had lived, she would have turned 34 years old in August. In an interview with \"48 Hours\" in November, John Ramsey said he can't imagine his daughter as a grown woman, but only as a 6-year-old. He said he is confident that the unknown male DNA profile in the case will ultimately lead to a suspect in her murder. He is asking investigators in Boulder to turn over that DNA to an independent private lab that can employ the same technology, genetic genealogy, that was used to identify the Golden State Killer in 2018, and countless others since.",
      "Ramsey also said there are seven items of evidence from the family's home that could still be tested for DNA including, he said, the garrote used to strangle JonBen\u00e9t, a rope found in a guest bedroom, as well as a blanket. The Boulder Police Department, however, in a release in November, disputed Ramsey's contention that they are not testing evidence.",
      "\"The assertion that there is viable evidence and leads we are not pursuing\u2014to include DNA testing \u2014 is completely false,\" read a Boulder Police statement. Still, in a nearly six-minute video that was also released, the current Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn admits, \"there were things that people have pointed to throughout the years that could have been done better and we acknowledge that is true.\"",
      "John Ramsey, who turned 81 in early December, has lived under a cloud of suspicion for nearly three decades, but he said the weight of constant public scrutiny was nothing compared to the loss of his child.",
      "\"It was just noise level stuff,\" Ramsey said, \"We were so devastated and crushed by the loss of JonBen\u00e9t \u2026 it didn't matter \u2026 it didn't matter.\"",
      "He is speaking out now, he said, because an arrest in the case would finally give some peace to his son Burke, now in his 30s, and his two older children from his first marriage.",
      "\"\u2026 identifying the killer,\" he said, \"isn't gonna change my life at this point, but it will change the lives of my children and my grandchildren. This cloud needs to be removed from our family's head and this chapter closed for their benefit.\"",
      "In addition to fighting to keep his daughter's case in the public eye, Ramsey is working to see the passage of The Homicide Victims' Families' Rights Act, which would allow a murder victim's family to request a federal review of their case.",
      "\"That would be a huge step forward to fix a fundamental problem in our system in this country,\" Ramsey said, \"not a complete solution, but it's a step forward.\"",

    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

    "title": "Biden's top hostage envoy travels to Syria to ask for help in finding Austin Tice",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 19:59:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Hostage envoy Roger Carstens traveled to Syria Friday, making the first known U.S. in-person contact with the caretaker government, and seeking help in finding missing American Austin Tice.",
    "story": [
      "Roger Carstens, the Biden administration's top official for freeing Americans held overseas, traveled to Damascus, Syria, on Friday for a high-risk mission: making the first known face-to-face contact with the caretaker government and asking for help finding missing American journalist Austin Tice.",
      "Tice was kidnapped in Syria 12 years ago during the civil war and brutal reign of now-deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. For years, U.S. officials have said they do not know with certainty whether Tice is still alive, where he is being held or by whom.",
      "Following his trip to Syria, in an exclusive interview Friday with \"Face the Nation\" from Amman, Jordan, Carstens disclosed that the U.S. Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs today conducted a \"joint search of a facility\" with\u00a0Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, known as HTS \u2014 the rebel group that recently overthrew Assad's regime and is emerging as a leading power \u2014 \"that we all thought would have some sort of relation to Austin Tice.\"",
      "He did not disclose the details of the search or its outcome, only saying that HTS was \"being helpful in the search for Austin.\"",
      "\"We had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities,\" Carstens said. \"And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time.\"",
      "Carstens said he was \"stunned\" by the number of prisons the Assad regime was operating.",
      "\"I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country, and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret,\" Carstens said. \"But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating.\"",
      "The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, accompanied Carstens to Damascus as a gesture of broader outreach to HTS.",
      "Near East Senior Adviser Daniel Rubinstein was also with the delegation. They were the first American diplomats to visit Damascus in over a decade, according to a State Department spokesperson.",
      "They had planned to meet with HTS representatives to discuss transition principles endorsed by the U.S. and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan, the spokesperson said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to Aqaba last week to meet with Middle East leaders and discuss the situation in Syria.",
      "Security for the U.S. delegation was provided by DSS Mobile Security Deployments, according to a State Department official. U.S. special operations forces also provided support as they traveled by vehicle across the Jordanian border and on the road to Damascus. The convoy was given assurances by HTS that it would be granted safe passage while in Syria, but there remains a threat of attacks by other terrorist groups, including ISIS.",
      "CBS News withheld publication of this story for security concerns at the State Department's request.",
      "While finding and freeing Tice and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime is the ultimate goal, U.S. officials downplayed expectations of a breakthrough on this trip. Multiple sources told CBS News that Carstens and Leaf's intent was to convey U.S. interests to senior HTS leaders, and learn anything they can about Tice.",
      "Rubinstein will lead the U.S. diplomacy in Syria, engaging directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria, the State Department spokesperson added.",
      "Diplomatic outreach to HTS comes in a volatile, war-torn region at an uncertain moment. Two sources even compared the potential danger to the expeditionary diplomacy practiced by the late U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who led outreach to rebels in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and was killed in a terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound and intelligence post.",
      "Sending high-level American diplomats to Damascus represents a significant step in reopening U.S.-Syria relations following the fall of the Assad regime less than two weeks ago. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Damascus have been suspended since 2012, shortly after the Assad regime brutally repressed an uprising that became a 14-year civil war and spawned 13 million Syrians to flee the country in one of the largest humanitarian disasters in the world.",
      "The U.S. formally designated HTS, which had ties to al Qaeda, as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. Its leader, Mohammed al Jolani, was designated as a terrorist by the US in 2013 and prior to that served time in a US prison in Iraq.",
      "Since toppling Assad, HTS has publicly signaled interest in a new more moderate trajectory. Al Jolani even shed his nom de guerre and now uses his legal name, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "U.S. sanctions on HTS linked to those terrorist designations complicate outreach somewhat, but they haven't prevented American officials from making direct contact with HTS at the direction of President Biden. Blinken recently confirmed that U.S. officials were in touch with HTS representatives prior to Carstens and Leaf's visit.",
      "\"We've heard positive statements coming from Mr. Jolani, the leader of HTS,\" Blinken told Bloomberg News on Thursday. \"But what everyone is focused on is what's actually happening on the ground, what are they doing? Are they working to build a transition in Syria that brings everyone in?\"",
      "In that same interview, Blinken also seemed to dangle the possibility that the U.S. could help lift sanctions on HTS and its leader imposed by the United Nations, if HTS builds what he called an inclusive nonsectarian government and eventually holds elections. The Biden administration is not expected to lift the U.S.\u00a0 terrorist designation before the end of the president's\u00a0 term on January 20th.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder disclosed Thursday that the U.S. currently has approximately 2,000 US troops inside of Syria as part of the mission to defeat ISIS, a far higher number than the 900 troops the Biden administration had previously acknowledged. There are at least five U.S. military bases in the north and south of the country.",
      "The Biden administration is concerned that thousands of ISIS prisoners held at a camp known as al-Hol could be freed. It is currently guarded by the Syrian Democratic forces, Kurdish allies of the U.S. who are wary of the newly-powerful HTS. The situation on the ground is rapidly changing since Russia and Iran withdrew military support from the Assad regime, which has reset the balance of power. Turkey, which has been a sometimes problematic U.S. ally, has been a conduit to HTS and is emerging as a power broker.",
      "A high-risk mission like this is unusual for the typically risk averse Biden administration, which has exercised consistently restrained diplomacy. Blinken approved Carstens and Leaf's trip and relevant congressional leaders were briefed on it days ago.",
      "\"I think it's important to have direct communication, it's important to speak as clearly as possible, to listen, to make sure that we understand as best we can where they're going and where they want to go,\" Blinken said Thursday.",
      "At a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had not yet met with Assad, who fled to Russia when his regime fell earlier this month. Putin added that he would ask Assad about Austin Tice when they do meet.",

    "summary": "Police say the driver is under arrest after plowing into the crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least 2 people and injuring dozens.",
    "story": [
      "At least two people were killed and dozens were injured after a car plowed into a busy Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, on Friday. Authorities said it appeared to be a deliberate attack.",
      "The driver of the car was arrested at the scene, Magdeburg police confirmed. They said their current assumption is that he was a \"lone perpetrator.\"",
      "The state premier of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff, described it as \"a lone attack.\" He said at a news conference at the scene in Magdeburg that the suspect was a 50-year-old doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006. He said the man had indefinite permission to stay and work in the country.",
      "Authorities said the driver had no criminal record, and the possible motive is unknown. The area surrounding the vehicle was sealed off by investigators.",
      "Haseloff said the two people confirmed dead were an adult and a toddler. He said at least 60 people were injured and that additional deaths could not be ruled out. Tamara Zieschang, Saxony-Anhalt's interior minister, said the number of injured was 68, with 15 hurt very seriously.",
      "\"It was a real chaotic situation,\" Lars Frohm\u00fcller, a reporter for German public broadcaster MDR, told CBS News partner BBC.",
      "\"We saw blood on the floor, we saw people sitting beside each other ... and we saw many doctors trying to keep people warm and help them with their injuries,\" he said.",
      "\"Everywhere were ambulances, there were police, there were a lot of firefighters.\"",
      "Shortly after the crash, Magdeburg's University Hospital said it was taking care of 10 to 20 patients but was preparing for more, dpa news agency reported.",
      "The sounds of sirens from first responders clashed with the market's holiday decorations, including ornaments, stars and leafy garland festooning the vendors' booths. Footage from the scene of a cordoned-off part of the market showed debris on the ground.",
      "\"This is a terrible event, particularly now in the days before Christmas,\" Haseloff said.",
      "Chancellor OIaf Scholz posted on X: \"My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. We stand beside them and beside the people of Magdeburg.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also sent condolences and\u00a0wrote, \"This act of violence must be investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Following the incident, the New York Police Department said it has deployed resources to various Christmas markets and other locations around the city \"out of an abundance of caution,\" but said it had not identified any specific or credible threats.",
      "Magdeburg, which is west of Berlin, is the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt and has about 240,000 residents.",
      "The suspected attack came eight years after an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. On Dec. 19, 2016, an Islamic extremist plowed through a crowded Christmas with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy.",
      "Christmas markets are a huge part of German culture, an annual holiday tradition cherished since the Middle Ages and successfully exported to much of the Western world. In Berlin alone, more than 100 markets opened late last month and brought the smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and bratwurst to the capital. Other markets abound across the country.",
      "German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said late last month that there were no concrete indications of a danger to Christmas markets this year, but that it was wise to be vigilant. She said Friday on social media, \"The news from Magdeburg is deeply shocking. The emergency services are doing everything they can to care for the injured and save lives. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.\"",

    "story": [
      "France's anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted eight people of involvement in the beheading of teacher Samuel Paty outside his school near Paris four years ago, a horrific death that shocked the country.",
      "Paty, 47, was killed by an Islamic extremist outside his school on Oct. 16, 2020, days after showing his class cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a debate on free expression. The assailant, an 18-year-old Russian of Chechen origin, was shot to death by police.",
      "Those who have been on trial on terrorism charges at a special court in Paris since the end of November were accused, in some cases, of providing assistance to the perpetrator and, in others, of organizing a hate campaign online before the murder took place.",
      "The 540-seat courtroom was packed for the verdict, which marked the final chapter of the Paty trial. Heavy surveillance was in place, with more than 50 police officers guarding the proceedings.",
      "Seated in the front row was Paty's 9-year-old son, accompanied by family members. As the lead judge, Franck Zientara, delivered sentences one after the other, emotions in the room ran high.",
      "\"I am moved, and I am relieved,\" said Ga\u00eblle Paty, Samuel Paty's sister, as she addressed a crowd of reporters after the verdict. \"Hearing the word 'guilty' \u2014 that's what I needed.\"",
      "\"I spent this week listening to a lot of rewriting of what happened, and it was hard to hear, but now the judge has stated what really happened, and it feels good,\" she added, her voice breaking as tears filled her eyes.",
      "Families of the accused reacted with gasps, cries, shouts, and ironic clapping, prompting the judge to pause multiple times and call for silence.",

      "Na\u00efm Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, friends of the attacker, were convicted of complicity in murder and sentenced to 16 years in prison each. Neither can be paroled for two thirds of their term, about 10 years. Boudaoud was accused of driving the attacker to the school, while Epsirkhanov helped him procure weapons.",
      "Brahim Chnina, 52, the Muslim father of the schoolgirl whose lies sparked the events leading to Paty's death, was sentenced to 13 years for association with a terrorist enterprise. Prosecutors had sought 10 years for him.",

      "The shocking death of the 47-year-old teacher left an indelible mark on France, with several schools now named after him.",
      "The trial had begun in late November. The defendants were accused of assisting a perpetrator or organizing a hate campaign online in lead-up to the murder.",
      "At the time of the attack, there were protests in many Muslim countries and calls online for violence targeting France and the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The newspaper had republished its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad a few weeks before Paty's death to mark the opening of the trial over deadly 2015 attacks on its newsroom by Islamic extremists.",
      "The cartoon images deeply offended many Muslims, who saw them as sacrilegious. But the fallout from Paty's killing reinforced the French state's commitment to freedom of expression and its firm attachment to secularism in public life.",
      "Chnina's daughter, who was 13 at the time, claimed that she had been excluded from Paty's class when he showed the caricatures on Oct. 5, 2020.",
      "Chnina sent a series of messages to his contacts denouncing Paty, saying that \"this sick man\" needed to be fired, along with the address of the school in the Paris suburb of Conflans Saint-Honorine. In reality, Chnina's daughter had lied to him and had never attended the lesson in question.",
      "Paty was teaching a class mandated by the National Education Ministry on freedom of expression. He discussed the caricatures in this context, saying students who did not wish to see them could temporarily leave the classroom.",
      "An online campaign against Paty snowballed, and 11 days after the lesson, Anzorov attacked the teacher with a knife as he walked home, and displayed the teacher's head in a post on social media. Police later fatally shot Anzorov as he advanced toward them, armed.",
      "Chnina's daughter was tried last year in a juvenile court and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Four other students at Paty's school were found guilty of involvement and given suspended sentences; a fifth, who pointed out Paty to Anzorov in exchange for money, was given a 6-month term with an electronic bracelet.",
      "Sefrioui, the preacher on trial, had presented himself as a spokesperson for Imams of France although he had been dismissed from that role. He had filmed a video in front of the school with the father of the student. He referred to the teacher as a \"thug\" multiple times and sought to pressure the school administration via social media.",

This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours.",
      "Ten days later, a pregnant Carmel, her husband and their toddler boarded a flight to Australia, which was looking for people in her husband's profession. And they spun the explanation to friends and family as something other than permanent \u2014 \"relocation\" is the easier-to-swallow term \u2014 acutely aware of the familial strain and the shame that have shadowed Israelis who leave for good.",
      "\"We told them we're going to get out of the line of fire for awhile,\" Carmel said more than a year later from her family's new home in Melbourne. \"It wasn't a hard decision. But it was very hard to talk to them about it. It was even hard to admit it to ourselves.\"",
      "Thousands of Israelis have left the country since Oct. 7, 2023, according to government statistics and immigration tallies released by destination countries such as Canada and Germany. There's concern about whether it will drive a \"brain drain\" in sectors like medicine and tech. Migration experts say it's possible people leaving Israel will surpass the number of immigrants to Israel in 2024, according to Sergio DellaPergola, a statistician and professor emeritus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.",
      "Thousands of Israelis have opted to pay the financial, emotional and social costs of moving out since the Oct. 7 attack, according to government statistics and families who spoke to The Associated Press in recent months after emigrating to Canada, Spain and Australia.",
      "Israel's population continues to grow toward 10 million people. But it's possible that 2024 ends with more Israelis leaving the country than coming in. That's even as Israel and Hezbollah reached a fragile ceasefire along the border with Lebanon and Israel and Hamas inch toward a pause in Gaza.",
      "Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated in September that 40,600 Israelis departed long-term over the first seven months of 2024, a 59% increase over the same period a year earlier, when 25,500 people left. Monthly, 2,200 more people departed this year than in 2023, the bureau reported.",
      "The Israeli Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, which does not deal with people leaving, said more than 33,000 people have moved to Israel since the start of the war, about on par with previous years. The interior minister refused to comment for this story, a spokesperson said.",
      "Other clues, too, point to a notable departure of Israelis since the Oct. 7 attacks. Gil Fire, deputy director of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, said some of its star specialists with fellowship postings of a few years in other countries began to waver about returning.",
      "\"Before the war, they always came back and it was not really considered an option to stay. And during the war, we started to see a change,\" he said. \"They said to us, 'We will stay another year, maybe two years, maybe more.'\"",
      "Fire says it's \"an issue of concern\" enough for him to plan in-person visits with these doctors to try to draw them back to Israel.",
      "Michal Harel, who moved with her husband to Toronto in 2019, said that almost immediately after the attacks, the phone began ringing \u2014 with other Israelis seeking advice about moving to Canada. On Nov. 23, 2023, the couple set up a website to help Israelis navigate moving, which can cost at least 100,000 Israeli shekels, or about $28,000, Harel and other Israeli relocation experts said.",
      "Not everyone in Israel can just pack up and move overseas. Many of those who have made the move have foreign passports, jobs at multinational corporations or can work remotely. People in Gaza, where local health officials say more than 45,000 people have been killed, have even less choice. Harel reported that the site has received views from 100,000 unique visitors and 5,000 direct contacts in 2024 alone.",
      "Aliya \u2014 the Hebrew term for used for immigration, literally the \"ascent\" of Jews into Israel - has always been part of the country's plan. But \"yerida\" \u2014 the term used for leaving the country, literally the \"descent\" of Jews from Israel to the diaspora, emphatically has not.",
      "A sacred trust and a social contract took root in Israeli society. The terms go \u2014 or went \u2014 like this: Israeli citizens would serve in the military and pay high taxes. In exchange, the army would keep them safe. Meanwhile, it's every Jew's obligation to stay, work and fight for Israel's survival.",
      "\"Emigration was a threat, especially in the early years (when) there were problems of nation-building,\" said Ori Yehudai, a professor of Israel studies at Ohio State University and the author of \"Leaving Zion,\" a history of Israeli emigration. \"People still feel they have to justify their decision to move.\"",
      "Shira Carmel says she has no doubt about her decision. She'd long objected to Netanyahu's government's efforts to overhaul the legal system, and was one of the first women to don the blood-red \"Handmaid's Tale\" robes that became a fixture of the the anti-government protests of 2023. She was terrified as a new mom, and a pregnant one, during the Hamas attack. This was not the life she wanted.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia beckoned. Carmel's brother had lived there for two decades. The couple had the equivalent of a green card due to Carmel's husband's profession. Basic logic, she says, pointed toward moving. They were able to catch a free flight out on seven hours' notice.",
      "And yet, Carmel recalls the frenzied hours before the flight out in which she said to her husband in the privacy of their bedroom: \"My God, are we really doing this?\"",
      "They decided not to decide. They packed lightly. But weeks in Australia became months, and the couple decided to have the baby there. They told their families back in Israel that they were staying \"for now.\"",
      "\"We don't define it as 'forever,'\" Carmel said on Tuesday. \"But we are for sure staying for the foreseeable future.\"",

      "Malaysia announced on Friday it has agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared 10 years ago in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.",
      "The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.",
      "Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has never been found. Malaysia's prime minister said 17 days after the plane disappeared that, based on the satellite data, his government had\u00a0concluded that the plane crashed down\u00a0in a remote corner of the Indian Ocean, and that there were no survivors.",
      "Transport Minister Anthony Loke said Malaysia had agreed to a new search operation by maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, which also carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.",
      "The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.",
      "Loke said a new 5,800 square mile area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity, which is based in the United Kingdom and United States.",
      "\"The new search area proposed by Ocean Infinity is based on the latest information and data analysis conducted by experts and researchers,\" Loke said.",
      "\"The proposal for a search operation by Ocean Infinity is a solid one and deserves to be considered,\" he told reporters.",
      "The government said it agreed to Ocean Infinity's proposal \"in principle\" on December 13, with the transport ministry expected to finalize terms by early 2025.",
      "The new search will resume \"as soon as the contract is finalized and signed by both parties,\" Loke said.",
      "\"They have informed us that the ideal time for the search in the designated waters is between January and April. We are working to finalise the agreement as quickly as possible,\" he added.",

      "Among the other victims was a celebrated group of 24 Chinese calligraphy artists coming from an exhibition of their work. Two young Iranian men on the plane, 18-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad and 29-year-old Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, were traveling on stolen passports to seek better lives in Europe.",
      "Two of the U.S. citizens on the plane were young children, Nicole Meng, 4, and 2-year-old Yan Zhang.",
      "Philip Wood was the only\u00a0American adult on the flight. The IBM executive had been living in Beijing and was planning to relocate to the Malaysian capital with his girlfriend, Sarah Bajc.",
      "\"No find, no fee\"",
      "The new search will be on the same \"no find, no fee\" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if they find the aircraft.",
      "The contract is for 18 months and Malaysia will pay $70 million to the company if the plane is found, Loke said.",
      "He said the decision to agree to a fresh search \"reflects the Malaysian government's commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure to the families of the MH370 victims.\"",
      "The original Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometers in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane, with only some pieces of debris picked up.",
      "In July 2015, an airplane fragment later\u00a0confirmed to be a flaperon\u00a0from MH370 was found washed ashore on the western Indian Ocean island of Reunion. It was the first hard evidence that the plane had gone down in the area. More debris was later found washed up on the coast of eastern Africa.",
      "The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories \u2014 including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.",
      "A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the course of the plane was changed manually.",
      "Asked if he was confident the plane will be found during the new search, Loke said: \"At this point, no one can provide guarantees.",

    "summary": "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said she had no regrets, but hope for the future after a judge sentenced her ex-husband to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping her for years.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in France on Thursday found the former husband of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who\u00a0admitted\u00a0to drugging and raping her repeatedly over the course of almost a decade and inviting dozens of other men to assault her as well, guilty of aggravated rape. Forty-nine men whom Dominique Pelicot brought into his home to assault his wife were also convicted Thursday as part of the same landmark trial.",
      "The man convicted of orchestrating the sustained assaults over the years was given the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while his co-accused were handed sentences ranging from three to 15 years.",
      "Over the course of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \u2014 who insisted that her full name be published and the court\u00a0proceedings be made public \u2014 was praised for her courage and became a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France and around the world.",
      "\"I want to express my gratitude, very profound, to all the people who supported me during this difficult time. Your witness, your statements, have really moved me and they have given me the strength to come back every day for these long days of the trial,\" Pelicot told journalists outside the court Thursday.",
      "\"I wanted to open the doors of this trial last September so that society could see what was happening. I'll never regret this decision. I have confidence in our capacity, collectively, to find a better future, in which men and women alike can live harmlessly together with mutual respect,\" she said.",
      "Roger Arata, the lead judge at the court in Avignon, southeast France, read out the verdicts for Dominique Pelicot and the 49 other men convicted of raping his former wife in her own bed at his invitation. One other man was accused of aggravated sexual assault. All the men were found guilty, but one had his conviction reduced from rape to sexual assault, and two of their sentences were suspended.",
      "\"The children are disappointed by these low sentences,\" one of Pelicot's family members, who asked not to be named, told the French news agency AFP.",
      "Pelicot was greeted as she arrived at the court Thursday by crowds holding signs with slogans such as: \"Thank you for your courage.\" She and her daughters sat in the courtroom as the verdicts were read out, resting their heads against a wall, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The trial began on Sept. 2 and, almost every day, Pelicot came face to face with her former husband, Dominique, or one of the 50 other men charged with assaulting her. She insisted that videos submitted as evidence, made by her ex-husband and showing men assaulting her while she appeared unconscious, be shown in the court.",
      "Her ex-husband was also found guilty of the attempted aggravated rape of a woman named Cillia, the wife of another man, Jean Pierre Marechal, who was one of the co-accused, as well as taking indecent images of his daughter, Caroline, and his daughters-in-law, Celine and Aurore, BBC News reported. Sitting in court, he showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out, according to the BBC. After the verdict and sentencing, his lawyer said he would have ten days to make an appeal, which he was considering.",
      "What happened to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot?",
      "The assaults took place between 2011 and 2020, when Dominique Pelicot was taken into custody. Police found thousands of photos and videos of the abuse on his computer drives, which helped lead them to other suspects. Some of the men said in court that they believed the unconscious woman was okay with it, or that her husband's permission was sufficient.",
      "Speaking in court during the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who is 72, talked about how she had thought she was in a loving marriage with her husband and would never have guessed what was happening.",
      "\"We would have a glass of white wine together. I never found anything strange about my potatoes,\" Pelicot told the court. \"We finished eating. Often when it's a football match on TV, I'd let him watch it alone. He brought my ice cream to my bed, where I was. My favorite flavor \u2014 raspberry \u2014 and I thought: 'How lucky I am. He's a love.'\"",
      "She said she never had any inkling that he was drugging her with the snacks.",
      "\"I never felt my heart flutter. I didn't feel anything. I must have gone under very quickly. I would wake up with my pajamas on,\" Pelicot told the court, adding that she would sometimes wake up \"more tired than usual, but I walk a lot and thought it was that.",
      "\"I'm trying to understand,\" she said, \"how this husband, who was the perfect man, could have got to this.\"",
      "Her then-husband recruited the other men to come and assault his wife via online chat rooms. The 50 other men accused in the case come from all walks of life and professions, and most were residents of the area.",
      "\"It's not for us to feel shame \u2014 it's for them,\" Pelicot declared during the trial, referring to the attackers. \"Above all, I'm expressing my will and determination to change this society.\"",
      "Pelicot continued attending the hearings throughout the trial, in part, because she \"felt she was somehow representing the victims of these kinds of abuses,\" her lawyer, St\u00e9phane Babonneau, said ahead of the verdicts being delivered on Thursday. \"There are very many victims that are going to trial, facing their aggressors without having anyone outside, lining up for them, offering flowers. So she felt that she needed to continue to keep focus, because she didn't elect to, but she felt that she was somehow representing the victims, and she felt responsible for that.\"",
      "Controversial French laws",
      "Pelicot's case triggered protests across France, and there was hope among some demonstrators that the case could lead to changes in controversial French laws governing sexual consent.",
      "France introduced a legal age of sexual consent in 2021 after a public outcry over the rape of an 11-year-old schoolgirl by a man who was initially convicted on a lesser charge. Since then, sex with anyone under the age of 15 has been viewed as non-consensual, but French law does not refer to consent in cases involving older victims.",
      "Under French law, rape is defined as penetration or oral sex using \"violence, coercion, threat or surprise,\" without taking consent into account, according to the Reuters news agency. Prosecutors must, therefore, prove an intention to rape if they are to be successful in court, legal experts told Reuters.",
      "Just 14% of rape accusations in France lead to formal investigations, according to a study by the Institute of Public Policies.",
      "\"Why don't we manage to obtain convictions? The first reason is the law,\" French legal expert Catherine Le Magueresse told Reuters. \"The law is written in such a way that victims must comply with the stereotype of a 'good victim' and a 'true rape': an unknown attacker, use of violence, and the victim's resistance. But it is only true for a minority of rapes.\"",

The humanitarian crisis in Gaza after more than a year of the Israel-Hamas war remains dire.",
      "Israeli officials say about 200 trucks cross from Israel into Gaza via the Kerem Shalom checkpoint every day, on average, carrying desperately needed supplies for Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire of the ongoing conflict.",
      "But a pressing question persists: Is the aid reaching those who need it most?",
      "At the distribution center, truck drivers and aid workers told CBS News about the struggles they face, including the looting of humanitarian goods, which they said remained a significant problem in Gaza. The chaos and lawlessness in the region often prevents supplies from reaching the intended recipients.",

      "He said that of 100 trucks that went out from this site, \"only 70 or 60 reached their destinations.\" The rest, he said, were looted.",
      "\"The only guarantee to get aid delivered safely is that there would [be] some stability in Gaza,\" he said. \"They [the gangs] take up positions near the border \u2026 near the [Israeli] army \u2026 and they don't face any problems.\"",

Since the start of the war in Gaza, at least 44,580 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, and most of its residents have been internally displaced.",
      "Danger was palpable during our visit, with the sound of shelling echoing nearby. Aid truck drivers risk their lives to navigate the perilous conditions created by shattered infrastructure and security threats inside Gaza, highlighting the immense challenges faced by both aid agencies and Gazan civilians.",
      "There has been cautious hope recently, however, as reports suggest ongoing negotiations for a hostage release deal could lead to a temporary ceasefire, and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.",
      "If such a deal does materialize, distribution centers like the one on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing may soon be overwhelmed with additional supplies, offering a lifeline to those in desperate need.",

      "Ukraine has been linked to previous attacks in Russia, including the August 2022 car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina and an explosion in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April 2023 that killed high-profile military correspondent Maxim Fomin, known as Vladlen Tatarsky.",
      "Putin was addressing the killing of Kirillov for the first time, more than 48 hours after the blast in a residential part of the Russian capital. Questions have been asked in Moscow about the security protocols for such a high-ranking and public figure involved in the military offensive on Ukraine.",
      "Kyiv claimed responsibility for the attack, saying explosives were packed into an electric scooter left by the door of a residential building.",
      "When Kirillov and his assistant left the building, it detonated, killing them both.",
      "Russia has detained an Uzbek citizen born in 1995, suspected of carrying out the attack, the Investigative Committee said Wednesday.",
      "It claimed he said he had been \"recruited by Ukrainian special forces.\"",
      "Putin on Thursday called the attack \"terrorism\".",
      "A source in Ukraine's SBU security services called Kirillov a \"legitimate target\" and has accused him of being behind the mass use of banned chemical weapons on the frontline in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Putin says he'll meet Trump \"any time\" about Ukraine",
      "Putin said Thursday he was ready for talks \"any time\" with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has touted his ability to strike a Ukraine peace deal within hours of coming to office.",
      "Trump, who will return to the White House in January, has stoked fears in Kyiv that he could force Ukraine to accept peace on terms favourable to Moscow.",
      "Holding his annual end-of-year press conference, the Kremlin leader said his troops held the upper hand across the battlefield, but was forced to admit he does not know when Russia will take back the western Kursk region where Ukrainian troops launched an incursion in August.",
      "The traditional annual question and answer sessions, often lasting hours, are largely a televised show while also being a rare setting in which he is put on the spot and answers some uncomfortable questions.",
      "Asked about Trump's overtures regarding a possible peace deal, Putin said he would welcome a meeting with the incoming Republican.",
      "\"I don't know when I'm going to see him. He isn't saying anything about it. I haven't talked to him in more than four years. I am ready for it, of course. Any time,\" Putin said.",
      "\"If we ever have a meeting with President-elect Trump, I am sure we'll have a lot to talk about,\" he said, adding that Russia was ready for \"negotiations and compromises.\"",
      "The Kremlin recently welcomed Trump's sharp criticism of President Biden's decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-supplied missiles to strike Russian territory \u2014 a major escalation in the nearly three-year conflict that Mr. Biden's administration said was necessitated by Putin drafting in thousands of North Korean soldiers to bolster his own ground forces.",
      "Russia's troops have been advancing in eastern Ukraine for months, with Putin repeatedly touting their prowess on the battlefield.",
      "\"We are moving towards resolving the primary aims that we set at the start of the special military operation,\" Putin said, using Russia's term for the conflict. \"Our guys are fighting heroically. The capabilities of the armed forces are growing.\"",
      "Moscow's army in November advanced at its fastest pace in east Ukraine since the first month of its 2022 attack.",
      "But asked by a woman from the Kursk region when residents will be able to return to their homes there, after thousands were evacuated from frontline areas amid the Ukrainian assault, Putin said he could not name a date.",
      "\"We will absolutely kick them out. Absolutely. It can't be any other way. But the question of a specific date, I'm sorry, I cannot say right now,\" he admitted.",
      "Putin challenges West to shoot down powerful new Russian missile",
      "Putin appeared to repeat his threat to strike Kyiv with Russia's powerful new multiple-warhead ballistic missile, dubbed Oreshnik. Russia has touted the Oreshnik as a hypersonic weapon virtually impossible to intercept, but an official at the U.S. Defense Department told CBS News it was assessed to be a variant of Russia's existing RS-26 rocket, an \"experimental\" intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM.",
      "Asked Thursday by a military journalist if the weapon had any flaws, Putin suggested a \"high-tech duel\" between the West and Russia to test his claims that it is impervious to air defenses.",
      "\"Let them set some target to be hit, let's say in Kyiv. They will concentrate there all their air defenses. And we will launch an Oreshnik strike there and see what happens,\" Putin proposed.",
      "Assad's ouster in Syria no \"defeat\" for Russia, Putin says",
      "In his first public comments since the fall of ex-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Putin rejected claims that his toppling was a \"defeat\" for Russia.",
      "\"You want to present what is happening in Syria as a defeat for Russia,\" Putin said in response to a question from a journalist. \"I assure you it is not... we have achieved our goals.\"",
      "Putin said he has not yet met Assad, who fled to Moscow as rebels closed in on Damascus, but plans to soon.",
      "Putin came to Assad's rescue more than once over the course of the grueling civil war in Syria, and he stands to lose a significant military foothold in the volatile Middle East with his long-time ally now decisively out of power.",
      "Putin says Russia's economy \"stable, despite external threats\"",
      "Putin was also pressed Thursday on the economic headwinds facing Russia \u2014 the fallout from a huge ramp up in military spending and deep labor shortages caused by the conflict.",
      "He insisted that the situation was \"stable, despite external threats,\" citing low unemployment and industrial growth.",
      "Asked about soaring inflation, Putin said that \"inflation is a worrying signal,\" and that price rises for foods such as butter and meat were \"unpleasant.\"",
      "He acknowledged that Western sanctions were also a factor \u2014 \"while they do not have key significance\" \u2014 and criticized his country's central bank, saying it should have taken measures beyond raising rates to lower inflation.",

    "summary": "A new Pentagon report says China is continuing to expand its nuclear force and has strengthened its ties with Russia over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "China is continuing its nuclear expansion, is strengthening its ties with Russia, and has increased military pressure against Taiwan over the past year, according to a new Defense Department report that examines actions accelerating key areas of conflict with the U.S.",
      "The report, released Wednesday, also noted that the recent rash of corruption allegations within China's powerful Central Military Commission, which oversees the People's Liberation Army, is hurting Beijing's military growth and could slow its modernization campaign.",
      "A senior defense official said China has made progress in some of its programs but slid back in others.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. assessment, warned that Beijing is working toward developing a more diverse and technologically sophisticated nuclear force. While the expected number of nuclear warheads has maintained consistent growth, China is broadening its targeting abilities.",
      "Beijing is going to be able to go after more and different types of targets, do greater damage and have more options for multiple rounds of counterstrikes, the official said. The U.S. is urging China to be more transparent about its nuclear program, while also warning that America will defend its allies and take appropriate steps in response.",
      "According to the report, which provides the annual U.S. assessment of China's military power and is required by Congress, By mid-2024, China had over 600 operational nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon expects it will have more than 1,000 by 2030. The Pentagon's estimate of China's current stock of nuclear warheads is about 100 higher than disclosed in last year's report, but that is a reflection in the change in the estimate, not the pace of production.",
      "The Biden administration has worked to maintain a balance with China, building up the U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region to be ready to counter Beijing while also encouraging increased communications between the two countries at the diplomatic and military levels.",

      "EXCLUSIVE: A conservative legal watchdog is expected to file a brief with a Kentucky court to urge a judge against blessing a consent decree forged by Attorney General Merrick Garland and the city of Louisville and Jefferson County, Ky., that would reform police practices after the controversial 2020 death of Breonna Taylor.",
      "The Oversight Project is placing its amicus brief on the docket of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on Friday morning as a judge prepares a schedule to rule on activating the agreement.",

      "A hail of return fire followed, fatally wounding Taylor, and five officers were later involved in legal cases where one was found guilty of deprivation of rights under the color of law for reportedly firing blindly through a window amid the chaos.",
      "Walker later alleged he mistook the police for intruders and did not hear them announce themselves. Louisville wound up paying Taylor\u2019s family $12 million in a wrongful death settlement.",
      "Last week, Garland announced the consent decree with Louisville, saying it will bring about needed systemic reforms to policing to prevent a repeat of what happened to Taylor.",
      "Howell said, however, that the decree will only hamstring the police department and also defy the will of Kentucky voters who elected new Republicans on the Louisville council on the issue of law and order.",
      "\"[The decree] basically limits the ability for officers to react quickly and in a strong way. It's very heavy on the de-escalation techniques, particularly as it relates to this category of people who they call \u2018behaviorally impaired\u2019 or something to that effect,\" Howell said.",

      "One of the most glaring issues with the agreement is the fact Louisville councilmen, Kentucky lawmakers and the general public will all be prevented from making further adjustments to policing policies for five years, if the judge signs the decree.",
      "In a consent decree system, an official monitor appointed by the judge, and not the relevant legislature, is the arbiter of policies that fall under said agreement unless both parties that forged it agree to change them.",

      "Greenberg said any decree must build on reforms made in recent years, cannot \"handcuff police as they work to prevent crime\" and also be financially responsible and have a clear sunset date.",

      "\"Most of these police consent decrees are more of an activist wish list than effective means to remedy constitutional violations by police agencies. The Justice Department is trying to impose burdensome rules that far exceed their authority under law,\" Johnson said.",
      "He suggested that technical assistance letters, which aim to encourage reforms without imposing a judicial arbiter, are generally preferred in most cases.",
      "\"But, the activist lawyers in the Biden administration prefer to use a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel. This approach has proven counterproductive time and again \u2014 hurting public safety, police morale, and police-community relations more than it helps.\"",

      "What\u2019s new?",
      "Apple has introduced an Inactivity Reboot feature in iOS 18.1, which automatically reboots your iPhone if it has been idle and unlocked for more than three days. This feature uses the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) to monitor when your iPhone was last unlocked.",

      "The main benefit of the inactivity reboot is better data protection. By forcing a reboot after prolonged idle time, the iPhone essentially wipes encryption keys from memory. Once rebooted, the phone enters an \"at rest\" state. This makes it nearly impossible for cybercriminals to decrypt the data.

      "His project, DartSolar, harnesses solar energy while the car is parked, potentially adding up to 20 extra miles of driving range each day without ever needing to plug in. As he gets ready to roll out the next iteration, Beta2, let\u2019s explore what makes this innovation so groundbreaking.",

      "The concept behind DartSolar",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) often spend significant time parked in open spaces, making them ideal candidates for solar energy collection. Sadeghpour's vision is simple yet effective: why not utilize the sun's energy to charge EVs while they are stationary? This concept forms the foundation of the DartSolar project.",
      "DartSolar isn\u2019t just about innovation; it\u2019s also about practicality. Imagine a rooftop solar panel that\u2019s aerodynamic, weatherproof, theft-resistant and easy to use. It opens in just 10 seconds with the same effort required to open your car door. These panels are tough, too, built to withstand wind, rain, sand and snow, ensuring reliable performance in all conditions.",

      "YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW FAR VOLVO'S NEW ELECTRIC SEMI-TRUCK GOES ON A SINGLE CHARGE",
      "The beta 1 prototype",
      "Omid Sadeghpour's initial prototype, known as Beta 1, was built in collaboration with Jeran Bruce at California's Forged Makerspace. This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Advancements with beta 2",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about the future. Beta 2, the fifth iteration of DartSolar, takes innovation to the next level. This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

First, it provides a viable charging solution for those venturing into remote areas where charging stations are scarce. Additionally, it acts as a backup energy source during power outages, allowing electric vehicles to remain operational even when traditional charging methods are unavailable.",

      "Scammers have become skilled at creating convincing fake websites.",
      "Online financial scams have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting unsuspecting individuals through various deceptive techniques. Cybercriminals exploit trust and create convincing scenarios to steal personal and financial information, often using well-known platforms like PayPal as their hunting ground.",
      "Take Paul from Massachusetts, for example. He recently wrote to us about his disturbing experience. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of online financial transactions. Here's his account in his own words.",
      "\"I wanted to sign up for PayPal and used Google to get the website.

      "Key takeaways from Paul's experience",
      "Paul's unfortunate encounter with online fraud offers several important lessons. First, scammers have become adept at creating highly convincing fake websites that can easily fool unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate platforms down to the smallest details, making it crucial to verify the authenticity of any site requesting personal information.",
      "Second, fraudulent transactions can occur with alarming speed once scammers obtain sensitive data. In Paul's case, the thieves attempted to make purchases within minutes of acquiring his credit card information.",
      "Third, credit card companies have developed sophisticated systems to detect suspicious activity rapidly, which can help mitigate potential losses. Paul's credit card company quickly alerted him to the unauthorized transaction and took swift action to prevent further fraud.",

      "Protecting your financial information online is crucial. Here are some important steps you can take to safeguard yourself against cyber threats:",
      "Verify the website's authenticity: Before entering any personal information online, always double-check the URL of the website you're visiting. Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the address and a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates a secure connection. To ensure you're on the correct site, type the web address directly into your browser instead of relying on search engine results or clicking on links from emails.",
      "Be wary of unsolicited communications:\u00a0Legitimate companies will never send unsolicited emails asking for sensitive information. Avoid clicking on links in emails claiming to be from financial institutions, as these could be phishing attempts. Hover over the links to see the actual URL before clicking, as this can help you identify suspicious or misleading addresses. If you're unsure about a communication, log in to your account directly through the official website or app to check for any notifications or requests.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Use strong authentication methods:\u00a0Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your financial accounts to add an extra layer of security. Create unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding the temptation to reuse passwords across multiple sites. Consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely.",
      "Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Make it a habit to check your financial accounts frequently for any unauthorized activities or suspicious transactions. Set up alerts for transactions on your credit cards and online payment accounts so you can be immediately notified of any activity on your accounts.",
      "Be cautious with personal information: Never share your passwords or answers to security questions with anyone, no matter how trustworthy they may seem. Be skeptical of any requests for personal information, especially those that create a sense of urgency. Legitimate organizations will not pressure you to provide sensitive data immediately.",
      "Use secure payment methods: When making purchases from unknown sellers, use protected payment options that offer buyer protection. Consider using credit cards for online purchases, as they often provide better fraud protection than debit cards. If a website offers multiple payment options, choose the most secure method available.",
      "Use caution with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks for financial transactions, as these can be easily compromised. If you must access financial accounts while away from home, use a secure VPN connection to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\u00a0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "As reported\u00a0by Guardio, the fake CAPTCHA scam is a sophisticated malvertising campaign that lures you into unknowingly installing malware under the guise of routine CAPTCHA verification. The cyberattack starts when you\u2019re browsing websites, often those offering free streaming, downloads or pirated content. These sites are used by hackers to present you with what appears to be a legitimate CAPTCHA verification page.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The page mimics a real CAPTCHA, asking you to confirm you are human. However, the instructions are designed to trick you into initiating harmful actions, like triggering the Windows \"Run\" dialog.

      "Who\u2019s to blame for this?",
      "The fake CAPTCHA scam shows how messy the internet\u2019s ad system has become, with everyone involved passing the buck. Guardio Labs points to ad networks like Monetag as a big part of the problem. They distribute malicious ads that are disguised during moderation using tricks like cloaking. Publishers, especially those offering free or pirated content, add to the issue by running these shady ads on their sites, often without checking what they\u2019re actually showing users.",
      "Then there are services like BeMob, which lets scammers hide their bad links behind harmless-looking URLs. These companies call themselves analytics tools, but they\u2019re helping the scams stay hidden. Hosting providers don\u2019t escape blame either. They\u2019re where these fake CAPTCHA pages live, and they often don\u2019t bother to check what\u2019s being hosted.",
      "Of course, the scammers themselves are the ones pulling the strings. But because they spread their operations across so many platforms, they\u2019re almost impossible to track down.

      "2. Enable browser protection features:\u00a0Modern browsers offer built-in security features, such as Safe Browsing and phishing protection, which warn you about potentially dangerous sites. Make sure these features are enabled in your browser settings. These tools can alert you to malicious links or fake CAPTCHAs trying to trick you into downloading malware.",
      "3. Be cautious with \"free\" content:\u00a0There\u2019s a saying that goes, \"If something is free, you\u2019re what they are selling.\" Websites that offer free downloads, streaming services or pirated content are often associated with malvertising campaigns. Fake CAPTCHA scams are commonly spread through these types of sites, where users are tricked into clicking on malicious ads or links. Even if a site seems tempting, it\u2019s important to be cautious. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or using \"free\" services, as they could be traps designed to infect your device with malware.",
      "4. Avoid clicking on suspicious ads:\u00a0Always be wary of ads that appear out of nowhere or seem too good to be true.

Never interact with pop-up ads or unfamiliar banners, especially those that claim to give you something for free, as they may lead to malicious pages or trigger malware downloads.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Check for HTTPS and look for signs of a legitimate site:\u00a0Before entering any personal information or interacting with a CAPTCHA, ensure that the website is secure. Look for \"https://\" in the website\u2019s URL, which indicates the connection is encrypted. Legitimate websites also tend to have a professional appearance, so if something feels off or the design looks poor, trust your instincts and leave the site.",

What\u2019s even more concerning is that ad networks, publishers and hosting services continue to allow malicious campaigns to spread through their platforms despite the widespread awareness of the problem.

      "Data breaches happen all the time, and while no data breach should be ignored, those involving health care institutions require special attention.",
      "These breaches can be very damaging and haunt people for life. Recently, hackers leaked the personal data of around 500,000 Americans.",
      "They breached the databases of the Center for Vein Restoration (CVR), which claims to be \"America\u2019s largest physician-led vein center,\" stealing not just personal data but also medical records.",

      "What you need to know",
      "CVR, a clinic headquartered in Maryland, experienced a massive data breach where hackers stole highly sensitive personal information, including lab results and health insurance details, as reported by\u00a0Cybernews. The breach occurred in early October, with the clinic detecting \"unusual activity\" in its systems on Oct. 6.",
      "CVR has more than 110 branches across the country, from Alabama to Alaska. This breach has affected hundreds of thousands of individuals. According to a\u00a0notice filed by CVR with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, more than 445,000 people had their personal information compromised.",
      "As the name suggests, CVR specializes in vein restoration, a very specialized procedure aimed at improving the health and function of veins. This means the clinic keeps a very elaborate record of its patients\u2019 health, and now all that is in the hands of hackers, along with copious amounts of personal information.",
      "The full list of exposed data includes addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical record numbers, diagnoses, lab results, medications, treatment information, health insurance information, provider names, dates of treatment and financial information.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The risks associated with the CVR data breach",
      "The risks of data breaches depend on the type of company affected. For instance, breaches involving companies like Ticketmaster are generally more manageable because they often expose information like contact details, addresses and, in some cases, identification documents. Even if financial data is leaked, it can typically be mitigated by replacing or blocking compromised accounts.",
      "Health care data breaches, however, are far more severe. When companies like CVR are targeted, hackers gain access to sensitive medical records that cannot be altered. Your medical history is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals can use this information to commit identity fraud, such as obtaining prescription drugs through false insurance claims. Plus, detailed knowledge of medical treatments, lab results and medications allows attackers to create highly targeted phishing scams, exploiting victims\u2019 vulnerabilities with alarming precision.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication: Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6. Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7. Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it's crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CVR data breach is deeply troubling, affecting nearly half a million individuals and exposing highly sensitive medical and personal information. What makes this breach particularly concerning is the lasting impact health care data leaks can have on victims, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. Whether or not you\u2019ve been directly affected, it\u2019s a stark reminder to take proactive steps, such as monitoring your accounts, enabling multifactor authentication and staying alert to phishing attempts.",

    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "The holiday season is the best time of the year. Many of us spend quality time with our families, enjoy delicious food and even go on vacations. For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "A woman shopping on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "Shopping scams are becoming harder to detect, but it\u2019s easy to stay ahead of them. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself while shopping on your phone.",
      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",
      "A woman shopping on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase. However, you can keep yourself safe by staying informed about potential threats, choosing apps with robust security measures and practicing good mobile hygiene.

      "1) Package delivery scam",
      "With the holiday season in full swing, the end-of-year sales have begun, and you probably have already started your holiday shopping and are expecting packages coming via different types of delivery services like FedEx, UPS or USPS. So, if you receive a text that mentions a package delivery, you may be likely to easily fall for a scam. I was expecting a package recently and received this text out of the blue (see image).",

      "Even though the text says the sender is not in my contact list and that it may be junk, I almost clicked the link because I was so focused on the fact that there may have been a typo in my delivery address. But once I looked a little closer, there were a few red flags in this text message that tipped me off to it being a scam.",
      "First, the link does not lead you to usps.com. It's a fake link that scammers hope you won't notice.\u00a0Notice it is uspsts.top and not\u00a0usps.com. This is a common scam going around called typosquatting wherein a scammer uses a domain that looks close to a real website. Next, the text says \"pls,\" which is lingo for \"please\" that you likely wouldn't see in correspondence from the USPS. Scammers often make typos or use poor grammar when communicating, so always double-check.Scammers are sending emails, texts and even occasionally there could be a phone call that is regarding an issue with package delivery. It may be something like this text I received that has a link where they'll end up asking for information, or you may be asked to pay a \"shipping fee\" to get your package.Be sure to always have strong\u00a0antivirus software running on your devices to prevent any disasters from happening if you were to click on a malicious link.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

You most likely received an email regarding your package, and if you go to that email to get your order number, you should be able to look up the status of your order directly on any website.",

      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",

      "3)\u00a0Social media gift exchange scam",
      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",

      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",
      "A woman shopping on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The website address does not match the name of the store or brand.The website has poor design and/or spelling and grammar errors.The website does not have a secure connection\u00a0(https) or a padlock icon in the address bar.The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",

      "The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.",
      "The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",
      "How to avoid falling victim to this scam",
      "By following a few simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scams and ensure a safer shopping experience.",
      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1) If you can regain control of your accounts, change your passwords and inform the account provider",
      "2) Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started",
      "3)\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4)\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5) Get the professional advice of a lawyer",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theftIf being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft",
      "If being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "6)\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7) Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",

We can take violence off the street. We can try to deter other people from being drivers of gun violence.

      "President-elect Trump responds to a question about whether he is considering a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "The Islamic Republic of Iran has continued its pursuit of obtaining a nuclear weapon by not only stockpiling enriched uranium to near-weapons grade purity, it has expanded its covert actions in developing its weaponization capabilities.",
      "According to information obtained by sources embedded in the Iranian regime and supplied to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition organization based out of D.C. and Paris, there are indications that Tehran has once again renewed efforts to advance its ability to detonate a nuclear weapon.",
      "At the head of Iran\u2019s detonators program is an organization the NCRI has dubbed METFAZ, which is the Farsi acronym for the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies on Explosions and Impact, and its recent movements at a previously deactivated site, known as Sanjarian, has drawn immense speculation.",
      "The Foundation for Defense of Democracies has analyzed where Iran's nuclear infrastructure is located. (Foundation for Defense of Democracies)",
      "IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS",
      "\"Our information shows the METFAZ has expanded its activities, intensified activities, and their main focus is basically the detonation of the nuclear bomb,\" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI in the U.S., told Fox News Digital. \"When you make a bomb, you have the fissile material at the center of it, but you need to be able to trigger it, to detonate it, and that\u2019s a sophisticated process.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to see what METFAZ does and follow their activities because that is sort of like a gauge on figuring out where the whole nuclear weapons program is,\" he added.",
      "Iran has at least a dozen sites across the country dedicated to nuclear development, weaponization, research and heavy water production, but information shared with Fox News Digital suggests that there has been an increase in covert activity in at least two of these locations, including Sanjarian, which was once one of Iran\u2019s top weaponization facilities.",
      "The Sanjarian site, located roughly 25 miles east of Tehran and once central to Iran\u2019s nuclear program under what is known as the Amad Plan, was believed to have been largely inactive between 2009 and late 2020 after stiff international pushback on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "The Sanjarian site in 2017, when the NCRI announced that its activities had moved to Plan 6 in Parchin. (Image provided by the NCRI)",
      "Though by October 2020 renewed activity had returned to the area under the alleged guise of a filming team, first captured through satellite imagery and which the Islamic Republic used to justify why\u00a0vehicles had reportedly been regularly parked outside the formerly top nuclear site.",
      "In 2022, trees were planted along the entrance road to the compound, effectively blocking satellite imagery from monitoring vehicles stationed there, before a security gate was then believed to have been installed in May 2023, according to information also verified by the Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "Sanjarian in 2024 (Image provided by the NCRI)",
      "Now, according to details supplied by on-the-ground sources to the NCRI this month, top nuclear experts have been seen regularly visiting the site since April 2024 and are believed to be operating under the front company known as Arvin Kimia Abzaar, which claims to be affiliated with the oil and gas industry, a sector in which Iran has long attempted to conceal its activities.",

      "METFAZ falls under Iran\u2019s Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is widely known to security experts as the organization spearheading Iran\u2019s nuclear development and is suspected of using the Sanjarian site for renewed research on exoloding bridgewire (EWB) detonators.",
      "Iran has previously attempted to conceal its EBW detonators program, a system first invented in the 1940s to deploy atomic warheads but which has expanded into non-military sectors, under activities relating to the oil industry.",
      "In a 2015 report, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), noted that Iran\u2019s detonator development was an \"integral part of a program to develop an implosion-type nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "It also highlighted how Iran attempted to conceal its program by alleging during a May 20, 2014, meeting that the detonator program dating back to 2000-2003 was related to Tehran\u2019s aerospace industry and was needed to \"help prevent explosive accidents\" but which the IAEA determined was \"inconsistent with the timeframe and unrelated to the detonator development program.\"",

      "\"The Iranian regime has really basically, over the years, used deceptive tactics \u2013 lies, stalling, playing games, dragging [their feet], wasting time,\" Jafarzadeh said when asked about this report. \"That\u2019s the way they\u2019re dealing with the IAEA, with the goal of moving their own nuclear weapons program forward without being accountable for anything.\"",
      "The IAEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on the NCRI\u2019s most recent findings, which were shared with the nuclear watchdog this week, and it remains unclear what advancements or research Iran continues to pursue in the detonator field.",

      "\"While the international community and the IAEA have mainly focused on the amount and the enrichment level of uranium Tehran possesses, which would provide fissile material for the bomb, the central part, namely the weaponization, has continued with little scrutiny,\" Jafarzadeh told Fox News Digital.",
      "The NCRI also found that METFAZ, which operates out of a military site known as Parchin some 30 miles southeast of Tehran, has expanded its Plan 6 complex where it conducts explosive tests and production.",
      "Parchin, which is made up of several military industrial complexes, was targeted in Israel\u2019s October 2024 strikes.

      "Iran\u2019s layered approach to its nuclear program, which relies on networks operating under the guise of privately owned companies, false operations and immense ambiguity, has made tracking Tehran\u2019s nuclear program difficult for even agencies dedicated to nuclear security, like the IAEA, Jafarzadeh said.",
      "\"The regime has used deceptive tactics to prevent any mechanism for verification, and it has yet to provide an opportunity or the means for the IAEA to have a satisfactory answer to the inquiries it has raised,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Our revelation today shows that the regime has no transparency related to its program for building an atomic bomb and is moving towards building the bomb at a rapid pace.\"",

The PA knows Iran will keep supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and this is the challenge they face.

      "\"Since October 7th, there has been an increased push\u00a0from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, with significant Iranian involvement,\" said Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Forum for Palestinian Studies at Tel Aviv University who further emphasized the shift in the situation since Oct. 7, noting the influence of Iranian-backed forces. \"They're trying to push operations in the West Bank, and there have been attempts to manufacture rockets and fire them at Israeli cities\u00a0from Jenin. While it\u2019s still in the early stages and these efforts are unsuccessful, it\u2019s a troubling development that signals how Jenin is evolving into a central hub for terrorists.\"",

This was the third death in Jenin within a week, following the killing of 19-year-old Rahbi Shalabi during gunfights between PA forces and local militants. The deaths have further fueled the discontent in the city, particularly among residents of the Jenin refugee camp. \"The entire refugee camp is now against the PA,\" said Daraghmeh.",
      "On Sunday, reports surfaced that the PA had positioned its forces outside the refugee camp, but attempts to enter were met with resistance.

The PA has lost control of these regions, and for years, Israel has treated Jenin and the surrounding areas like Gaza- without PA control mechanisms, and essentially, there\u2019s a real vacuum.\"",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, and President Biden shake hands in the West Bank town of Bethlehem on Friday, July 15, 2022. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)",
      "The timing of the PA\u2019s operation is significant, with many observers noting that it coincides with the broader regional context, including the ongoing war in Gaza and the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Milshtein believes that the events in Syria played a role in the PA\u2019s decision to act. \"People in the West Bank say that when one dictator (PA President Mahmoud Abbas) saw what happened to the other (Bashar al-Assad), he decided he would not follow the same fate,\" Milshtein explained. \"Mahmoud Abbas likely felt that he needed to act before the PA\u2019s authority in the West Bank completely erodes.\"",
      "The operation, which is part of a larger crackdown in the northern West Bank, also reflects the PA\u2019s desire to assert itself as a capable authority ahead of potential political developments in Gaza. The PA has long struggled with its ability to govern Gaza, which it lost to Hamas in 2007. Now, with the region in turmoil, it is hoping to prove that it can restore order in the West Bank, which it argues will bolster its legitimacy in any postwar political scenario for Gaza.",

For 17 years, they have been ruled by Hamas, and 60% were born after Hamas took control. They were educated to view the PA as collaborators with Israel and enemies. Giving the PA two hours in Gaza is a known failure from the outset.\"",
      "Despite the violence in Jenin, Daraghmeh does not foresee the conflict spreading beyond. \"People in Ramallah, Hebron and other cities don\u2019t want the West Bank to turn into another Gaza,\" Daraghmeh said. \"The situation in Jenin is contained, but it remains a test for the PA\u2019s ability to control its own territory.\"",

      "\"Russia\u2019s ties with Iran and its support for Hezbollah and Hamas make it clear Russia is no neutral player for Israel,\" Korniychuk explained. \"Now that Russia\u2019s role in Syria is diminishing,\u00a0Israel has no excuse \u2013 it should seize the opportunity to work more closely with Ukraine.\"",
      "The ambassador added, \"Both our countries face the same threats. Israel has the expertise we need in air defense, and we have the experience in defending ourselves against Iranian drones. These drones are becoming a growing problem for both Ukraine and Israel.\"",

      "Edelstein noted, \"I\u2019m not suggesting we should open a war with Russia. But when it comes to cooperation with the Ukrainians, the Israeli interest is a close cooperation in anything related to defense, especially regarding missiles and drones. Look at what\u2019s happening in Israel,\" he said referring to recent events, when Iranian drones were able to penetrate the airspace of Israel, which is protected by highly advanced systems like the Iron Dome and Arrow.",
      "However, against what is perceived as a simpler threat, a drone strike took the lives of four soldiers at an Israeli base. \"If, together with the Ukrainians, two years ago we had entered the defense field when the problems began here, we could have been better prepared.\"",
      "An Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that while Israel is advancing its own technology to combat Iranian drones, it takes time. \"The Iron Dome, for example, is crucial for air defense, but it wasn\u2019t designed to handle mass drone attacks, which is a challenge both Israel and Ukraine are facing,\" the official said. \"Israel\u2019s systems are effective against rockets, but drones are another story. Ukraine has become a testing ground for real combat conditions, and we missed the chance to take advantage of that.\"",

An Israeli government official speaking on background said, \"The intelligence cooperation between Ukraine and Israel has been far more advanced than our political relations.\" A Ukrainian official confirmed that, saying, \"The intelligence communities in Ukraine and Israel have close and productive relations, and I hope that on the military level, Israel will now agree to sell Ukraine technologies and equipment that can assist it in the war against Russia.\"",

      "Rebekah Koffler, strategic military intelligence analyst and author of\u00a0\"Putin\u2019s Playbook,\" said Israel\u2019s primary concern should be its regional security, particularly in relation to Iran, and that the collapse of Assad\u2019s regime and the weakening of Russia\u2019s influence in Syria has not changed that. \"As much as there is pressure for Israel to support Ukraine, strategically, Israel has more to gain by remaining neutral with Russia. Russia still holds significant leverage in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"A stable relationship with Russia offers Israel a strategic advantage,\" Koffler continued, \"especially in managing the Iranian threat and maintaining influence with key regional actors like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey, where Putin has leverage. Ukraine, on the other hand, offers little to Israel. While Ukraine is highly dependent on Western support, Israel does not derive significant benefits from this relationship.\"",
      "Daniel Vajdich, a Republican foreign policy expert and president of Yorktown Solutions, which advises Ukrainian state entities, highlighted that Israel is now in a stronger position to support Ukraine, given the changing security landscape. \"Israel\u2019s strategic focus has always been on its own security, especially after 14 months of multifront war. But now, there is certainly room for more support for Ukraine,\" Vajdich explained. \"Israel\u2019s defense capabilities, especially in air defense, are exceptional, and Ukraine could benefit significantly from that expertise.\"",

      "Vajdich also pointed out that a shifting geopolitical landscape could provide Israel with more freedom to support Ukraine without facing the same level of external pressure. \"The Trump administration likely won\u2019t pressure Israel to increase its support for Ukraine, unlike the Biden administration,\" he said. \"However, more U.S. support to Israel, particularly under a future Trump administration, could allow Israel to feel more secure in providing additional help to Ukraine. Israel will likely continue to prioritize its security, but the space for collaboration with Ukraine is expanding.\"",

In Idlib, HTS created a bureaucratic system and various ministries to administer some public services, including public safety.",

President Trump came back from the political dead and on the shoulders of the most powerful populist movement in the history of the world \u2026 won a landslide victory.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have nothing else to discuss,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only about the execution of President Trump\u2019s plan.\u201d",

(Technically, the speaker does not need to be a sitting member of Congress.)",
      "The speakers at AmericaFest also called for the Senate to confirm Trump's Cabinet picks. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host and a Trump ally, described opponents of Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s nomination for director of national intelligence as threats to the nation.",
      "Any Republican senator who votes against Gabbard is \u201can enemy of the United States. Period,\u201d Carlson said.",
      "Gabbard is one of several Trump picks who have come under tough scrutiny. Dozens of former national security officials signed a letter criticizing her selection, saying she lacked the necessary experience and questioning whether she could offer unbiased intelligence analysis.",
      "When Gabbard ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, Russian state propaganda often portrayed her candidacy favorably while denigrating that of Joe Biden and other Democratic candidates at the time, according to research from the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a think tank in Philadelphia.",

      "Among the measures being debated by Congress to avert a government shutdown is increasing the debt ceiling \u2014 or eliminating it entirely.",
      "It's arguably the most unusual demand from President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans seeking to ward off a major government disruption just as the holidays arrive.",
      "That's because, in recent decades, Republicans were the ones who sought to use debt-ceiling increases to extract concessions from Democrats, arguing that government spending was getting out of control.",
      "What is this unusual limit, and why have Republicans' views on it suddenly changed?",
      "Debt limit and default",
      "Like many other entities, the U.S. government borrows money to help pay its bills. The debt ceiling establishes that, at a certain point, the U.S. Treasury can no longer continue to borrow money to pay the government's fiscal obligations.",
      "But because those spending requirements will nevertheless continue to accrue, the failure to raise the debt limit would put the U.S. in technical default, meaning it could no longer pay its bills.",
      "The U.S. pays many of its bills through borrowing, so without that mechanism in place, whoever the government owes money to will, in an overwhelming number of cases, fail to be paid.",
      "That would send shockwaves through the U.S. economy and global financial markets. Current White House officials have said a default would likely cause a recession while also affecting everything from Social Security benefits to child tax credit payments to paying U.S. service members and contractors.",
      "A soft brake on government borrowing",
      "The debt ceiling is a relatively new instrument in the U.S.'s economic toolkit. For the first 128 years of the nation's existence, Congress directly authorized individual borrowing efforts.",
      "That changed in 1917, when Congress decided to impose a debt ceiling to replace separate borrowing votes and streamline the massive financial obligations imposed by World War I.",
      "In 1939, the government officially decided to use the debt ceiling in order to manage its debt obligations on an aggregate basis.",
      "Since then, the debt ceiling has served as a nominal brake on federal spending, allowing Congress to reflect on the debt load the U.S. is carrying at any given moment.",
      "Yet overall, most of that reflection hasn't gone very far. Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been raised 78 times \u2014 49 times under Republican presidents, and 29 times under Democratic administrations.",
      "Debt growth and gridlock worries",
      "Today, the U.S. has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, meaning it is borrowing more than it is producing.",
      "There remains debate among economists about whether that matters. Compared to other countries with large debt loads, the interest rates the U.S. pays to borrow money are relatively low. And until very recently, they had even been declining over a period of decades.",
      "That has changed since the pandemic, as financial markets have grown increasingly wary of both ongoing U.S. spending outlays, as well as overall political gridlock \u2014 especially fights over debt ceilings \u2014 which have created something of a vicious cycle.",
      "Financial authorities would prefer that the rate of U.S. spending slow down. Beyond that, the greater hope is that government officials stop fighting over whether to fund spending obligations that were already put on the books during the regular budgeting process.",
      "\"One day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a 2021 interview. \"It\u2019s all politics.\u201d",
      "Bipartisan support",
      "So what if the debt ceiling were to simply go away entirely? It's something Democrats have long called for. Ultimately, they argue, there's neither a real legal reason nor, for now, a financial rationale for why the government can't continue to borrow money.",
      "Now, for the first time, the head of the Republican Party seems to be taking up that argument.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge,\u201d Trump exclusively told NBC News on Thursday. The debt limit, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean anything, except psychologically.\u201d",
      "The idea quickly gained support among some prominent Democrats.",
      "\u201cI agree with President-elect Trump that Congress should terminate the debt limit and never again govern by hostage taking,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Yet the reasons Trump wants to get rid of it now are likely twofold: First, it is already set to hit during the first few months of his second term in office. And second, his plan to cut taxes is expected to reduce federal revenues by trillions of dollars, meaning government spending obligations already signed into law would have to be covered by more borrowing.",
      "Despite the smattering of Democratic support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries from New York's 8th District, has said elimination of the debt ceiling is a nonstarter.",
      "And fiscal conservatives continue to be opposed to debt ceiling elimination.",
      "\"My position is simple \u2014 I am not going to raise or suspend the debt ceiling (racking up more debt) without significant & real spending cuts attached to it,\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said in a post on X. \"I\u2019ve been negotiating to that end. No apologies.\"",
      "Roy has already drawn the ire of Trump for taking that position.",
      "\u201cThe very unpopular \u2018Congressman\u2019 from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual, of having yet another Great Republican Victory \u2014 All for the sake of some cheap publicity for himself. Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "This time, it seems, the Democrats are positioning themselves as the guardians of fiscal responsibility."

    "title": "How false claims that the Madison school shooter was transgender spread online",
    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 02:31:51 GMT",
    "summary": "It\u2019s become common for anti-trans social media users to quickly spread false or unverified claims about the gender identities of shooting suspects.",
    "story": [
      "Only 38 minutes after a Madison, Wisconsin, teacher called 911 to report Monday\u2019s school shooting, the lies began to spread.",
      "The first one, in a post on X, said simply: \u201cTaking bets on another trans shooter.\u201d The post didn\u2019t pick up much traction.",
      "But 57 minutes later, the false claims about the shooter\u2019s gender identity found their footing.",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who regularly spreads unfounded claims after shootings, posted on X: \u201cIf the statistical trend continues with this tragic event, there is a 98% chance the shooting is trans or gang related.\u201d Jones has 3.4 million followers on the site, and his post was viewed 282,000 times in a day.",
      "Jones was tapping into a trend on the conservative internet that now plays out after many high-profile crimes: People hunt for clues to try to connect a given crime to transgender people, or they jump to the conclusion that a suspect is transgender regardless of whether evidence points that way or is relevant to the crime.",
      "Conservative news website Townhall followed one minute after Jones, posting a clip of Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes giving a hurried initial news conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a male or female,\u201d he said in the clip.",
      "The Townhall clip was eight seconds long and did not show the context of Barnes\u2019 comment. Reporters had asked him several questions and he didn\u2019t know the answer to many of them, such as what type of gun the shooter used. It wasn\u2019t clear from the clip whether the shooter\u2019s gender was ambiguous or whether the chief simply didn\u2019t have the information.",
      "Without the context, dozens of X accounts used the Townhall video to speculate that the shooter was transgender. The video received more than 650,000 views, and, after other accounts reshared the video with speculation of their own, the number of views ballooned to more than 1.5 million. For hours afterward, other conservative accounts with millions of followers, including @EndWokeness and Ian Miles Cheong, joined in the speculation about the shooter\u2019s gender and whether it might be nonconforming.",
      "But the speculation was wrong: Police eventually identified the shooting suspect as a 15-year-old girl, with no evidence that she was transgender.",
      "At a subsequent news conference Monday night, hours after his initial remarks, Barnes was asked by a reporter about the transgender rumors. He said he didn\u2019t know how she identified and that he believed the answer was inconsequential.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish people would kind of leave their own personal biases out of this.\u201d",
      "Later, the EndWokeness account said in a direct message on X that they shared the video of Barnes\u2019 initial news conference because they found his statement about not knowing the gender hard to believe.",
      "\u201cIf the guy giving the press conference (police chief) didn\u2019t know and others knew, he should find a new job,\u201d the account posted on Thursday.",
      "Alex Jones did not respond to a request for comment sent to his media outlet, Infowars. Townhall, Cheong and X did not respond to requests for comment either.",
      "The trend of trying to link crime to transgender people is a potential distraction and time-wasting exercise for law enforcement, the news media and social media users who, in the wake of a mass shooting, are trying to sort through fact from fiction. And LGBTQ advocates say the false claims spread irrational fear throughout the community.",
      "A similar dynamic of falsely saying a mass-shooting suspect is transgender or nonbinary has played out before, including after shootings in Houston in February, in Philadelphia last year and in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022.",
      "The Gun Violence Archive, which maintains a database of shootings, estimates that 0.11% of known suspects in mass shootings were transgender over the past decade, said Mark Bryant, the archive\u2019s executive director. The archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed, not counting the shooter. There were many more instances in which trans people were victims, Bryant added.",
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., added to the baseless speculation Monday afternoon when he asked on X why \u201ctrans control\u201d wasn\u2019t being considered as a response to the shooting, rather than gun control.",
      "That prompted a response from Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus.",
      "\u201cYour ignorance speaks volumes. Your hate is consuming your brains (or what\u2019s left of them),\u201d he posted on X late Monday. His post received only about 47,000 views, compared to the millions of views the false claim got on the platform.",
      "The attempts to connect trans people with criminal tendencies are not rooted in fact, experts say.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that trans people are any more dangerous than cisgender people,\u201d said Henry Fradella, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University who has studied the subject.",
      "Some researchers have looked for a potential correlation, and one study \u2014 conducted in Sweden with data collected since the 1970s, in a broader effort to measure the mortality of trans people \u2014 showed mixed evidence. But an author of that study, Mikael Land\u00e9n, cautioned against interpreting his work as implying that transgender people cause increased crime. Land\u00e9n, in an email to NBC News, said that even if there were a correlation between the two, other factors could be at play, including substance use disorders, socioeconomic stressors and neurodivergent conditions.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge, no research has attempted to disentangle these effects,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Trans people are four times as likely to be the victim of a crime as others, according to a study published in 2021 in the American Journal of Public Health.",
      "Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said the anti-trans speculation Monday was a \u201csmoke screen\u201d to hide measures to reduce gun violence.",
      "\u201cGun violence remains the number one cause of death for children, yet social media extremists routinely exploit these horrific crimes to distract from that fact with more of their harmful rhetoric about vulnerable and marginalized communities,\u201d Ellis said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "In the case of Monday\u2019s shooting, the speculation about gender competed for attention with the search for her actual motives. The shooter, Natalie Rupnow, who went by Samantha, died en route to a hospital of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Many of the posts speculating that Rupnow was transgender came from accounts that have an anti-trans slant in other contexts. Those accounts include Libs of TikTok, which is devoted to sharing videos of trans, queer or progressive people in an attempt to expose what it sees as wrongdoing. Libs of TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The speculation about the Wisconsin shooter happened mostly on X, the app owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk. X conducts minimal content moderation, especially around transgender issues, and Musk has expressed opposition to trans rights. Musk has a trans daughter, from whom he remains estranged. Musk has also made changes to X\u2019s operation \u2014 including revenue-sharing with accounts based on viewership \u2014 that have changed the incentives on the platform.",
      "Some of the speculation also occurred on other apps including Instagram, where a post saying falsely that the shooter was transgender received more than 2,100 likes. Instagram\u2019s parent company, Meta, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The X posts from Monday included a decade-old image that has been recycled on a regular basis for alleged transgender shooting suspects: an altered photo of comedian Sam Hyde holding a rifle.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why people on X thought that Rupnow was transgender. One X account said \u201cthe trans thing is obvious\u201d from comments on an X account that appeared to belong to her. Other accounts focused on her appearance, calling it \u201cambiguous,\u201d despite her being a minor. Some cited a Discord account with no confirmed connection to her that used they/them pronouns. And one account cited \u201cunconfirmed social media postings\u201d from alleged classmates of Rupnow.",
      "After the posts by Jones and Townhall, other accounts picked up the speculation and spread it. One post alleging that the shooter was trans and \u201con testosterone\u201d received 3.2 million views and, eventually, a user-generated fact-check from X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d feature debunked it. Most other posts on the subject did not have community notes."

      "\u201cThe literacy that is required to understand a meme can be very, very intense and complex, because you need to know five different memes throughout internet history to even get the joke,\u201d Caldwell said.",
      "Memes nowadays tend to emerge as references or reactions to something else, such as pop culture or news events, digital culture researcher Jamie Cohen said.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically online or terminally online, a lot of these ways of reading media are almost like making translations in real time,\u201d said Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at City University of New York-Queens College. \u201cCultural savviness is more required for memes today than they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d",

      "Brat summer",
      "From green walls to presidential campaigns, \u201cBrat,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s sixth studio album, was inescapable this year. The album redefined the word \u201cbrat,\u201d serving as a rejection of perfection. To be \u201cbrat\u201d is to be, as Charli XCX put it, \u201chonest, blunt and a little bit volatile.\u201d It\u2019s fitting that a record so hedonistic and vulnerable would soundtrack a chaotic year full of elections, celebrity beef, unprecedented natural disasters and more.",
      "Charli XCX had hovered in pop music\u2019s \u201cmiddle class\u201d for years, but her latest release unexpectedly catapulted her to previously unknown heights. The virality most likely helped her snag multiple Grammy nominations, including one in the coveted album of the year category.",
      "The great X-odus",
      "First it was Mastodon. Then Threads. Now Bluesky (again). Former Twitter users have been intermittently fleeing what is now X ever since Elon Musk bought it in 2022, but its largest user exodus began right around this year\u2019s election. Over the last month, millions of users \u2014 including many celebrities and brands \u2014 have flocked to alternative text-based social media apps like Bluesky and Threads, both of which had significant spikes in user signups after the election.",
      "Many X users have pointed to growing issues such as bots, partisan advertisements and harassment. Following previous waves of users\u2019 abandoning the app for a coveted but still-elusive Twitter replacement, the discontent reached another tipping point this year when Donald Trump was re-elected president with Musk\u2019s support. Meanwhile, Musk has been touting X as a replacement to news media outlets.",
      "The Paris Olympics",
      "The Olympics were arguably the cultural moment of the year. The 19-day event featured lavish opening and closing ceremonies and a slew of athletic triumphs (including some by Team USA, which took home 125 medals). Many buzzworthy moments gained traction online, turning some competitors into even bigger stars and energizing people watching at home.",
      "Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen captivated the world with his TikTok videos about the muffins at the Olympics Village; Kim Ye-ji, a South Korean pistol shooter, and Turkish shooter Yusuf Dike\u00e7 impressed viewers with their skills and style; Team USA gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik (aka \u201cpommel horse\u201d guy) and Team USA rugby player Ilona Maher became so popular during the Games that they got cast on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d",
      "It was also a star-filled affair. C\u00e9line Dion closed out the opening ceremony with her first performance since she announced her diagnosis with stiff-person syndrome in 2022. The Games closed with the literal and figurative passing of the torch to Los Angeles, where the Summer Games will take place in 2028.

      "As the clip gained traction, Welch was launched into overnight stardom, propelled by a Barstool-esque crowd of internet users who lauded her bold, unapologetically sexual humor. Though many online snarked on the merits of her newfound fame, \u201cHawk Tuah girl\u201d has leveraged the attention to build a brand off the slogan, including her podcast, \u201cTalk Tuah,\u201d and other business ventures.",
      "\u2018Very demure\u2019 and an effort to trademark virality",
      "In 2024, everyone became obsessed with being \u201cvery mindful\u201d of their actions and acting \u201cvery cutesy\u201d or \u201cvery demure.\u201d The phrases became online phenomena after a TikTok user named Jools Lebron made a video explaining how she handles a wide variety of daily situations.",
      "With the viral fame came an unexpected trademark battle for Lebron after a surprise trademark application in August sparked a frenzy over the legal rights to the viral phrase. Lebron documented the struggle to gain control over the \u201cDemure\u201d trademark, showcasing just how difficult it is for creators to monetize their sudden internet fame.",

Their back-and-forth continued throughout the summer as the rappers churned out track after track. Drake took their beef to court \u2014 claiming in a filing last month that Universal Music Group, the distributor for both rappers\u2019 labels, \u201cartificially inflated\u201d numbers for Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on Spotify.",

      "The term has primarily been linked to Gen Alpha, defined as children born after 2010, who have created their own language within their online communities. Brain rot lingo is often associated with words like: \u201csigma,\u201d someone who is cool or a leader; \u201cgyatt,\u201d which is an exclamation for a curvaceous woman; and \u201cSkibidi,\u201d as in \u201cSkibidi Toilet,\u201d a term derived from a\u00a0YouTube series\u00a0that is now used to mean basically anything."

    "summary": "The choice of Patel signaled to current and former officials that Trump\u2019s campaign trail talk about seeking vengeance was more than just that",
    "story": [
      "The first signs of alarm came hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced what could prove to be one of his most consequential Cabinet picks.",
      "Less than a day after Trump named Kash Patel as his choice for FBI director, a former federal law enforcement official asked me a question: \"curious if I'm on that list?\"",
      "He was referring to a list of roughly 60 people who Patel had said were members of the \u201cdeep state\u201d in a memoir last year, \u201cGovernment Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth and the Battle for Our Democracy.\"",
      "Days later, a former intelligence official reached out to ask the same question. After checking the book, I told them they hadn\u2019t made the list.",
      "But even for those not on the list, their absence hasn\u2019t quelled the fears of a dozen current and former Justice Department, FBI and intelligence officials have expressed to NBC News their fears that Patel, if confirmed, would use his power as FBI director to criminally investigate Trump\u2019s perceived adversaries, including them.",
      "The choice of Patel, who has used claims of \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies against Trump to fuel his rise in Trumpworld and apparently gain the president-elect\u2019s trust, signaled to current and former officials, as well as many observers, that Trump\u2019s campaign trail talk about seeking vengeance was more than just that.",
      "On Wednesday, those fears deepened when the head of a Republican-controlled House subcommittee formally requested that the FBI criminally investigate former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., for her work on the House committee that investigated Trump\u2019s actions before and during the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. capitol.",
      "The announcement came ten days after Trump said in an interview with NBC News that members of the Jan. 6 committee were \u201cpolitical thugs and, you know, creeps,\u201d and that, \u201cfor what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.\u201d",
      "Cheney dismissed the calls for her to be criminally investigated in a post on Bluesky and said Trump and his allies were fabricating \"lies and defamatory allegations in an attempt to cover up what Donald Trump did... No reputable lawyer, legislator or judge would take this seriously.\u201d",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old lawyer who grew up on Long Island, has worked as a federal public defender in Florida, a Justice Department prosecutor and a congressional staffer. While he was working for former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., Patel\u2019s standing with Trump and Trump loyalists soared after he wrote a memo accusing FBI officials of political bias and abuse of power during their investigation of possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.",
      "The memo accurately described what were later found to have been abuses by the FBI relating to surveillance of Trump aide Carter Page.\u00a0But the DOJ inspector general uncovered no evidence of political bias driving the FBI's Russia investigation.",
      "Patel then worked in the White House as a senior director for counter-terrorism before briefly serving in the Pentagon as the Defense Secretary's chief of staff.",
      "Critics say that Patel does not have managerial experience to run the FBI and that his rise has been primarily fueled by his willingness to spread unproven conspiracy theories that paint Trump as the victim of plots engineered by Democrats. But Patel has so far received strong support from Republican senators in his bid to direct the FBI.",
      "If he gets the job, Patel has made no secret of what his priorities might be, and who could face investigation.",
      "In \"Government Gangsters,\" he describes the \u201cDeep State\u201d as a corrupt cabal of Republican and Democrats, elected officials and civil servants, and senior FBI, DOJ and Pentagon officials who he says have committed crimes against Trump.",
      "\u201cThe Deep state is continuing to weaponize the power of the state against internal dissidents,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cThey are the ones who covered up their own crimes. \u2026 They are the criminals.\u201d",
      "Patel\u2019s list of Deep State members ranges from top Trump political adversaries, such as Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, to lifelong Republicans who served in Trump\u2019s first administration but declined to support his false claims that he won the 2020 election, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former national security adviser John Bolton.",
      "His definition of the 'deep state' appears to include the organization he hopes to lead.",
      "\u201cOne of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State is the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe FBI is now the prime functionary of the Deep State.\u201d",
      "The dozen current and former officials who have spoken to NBC News said that the various federal investigations of Trump were fueled by his statements or actions and that they were all conducted properly. They said they do not fear going to jail because they committed no crimes.",
      "Echoing legal experts, they said they expected federal judges, who are lifetime appointees, to throw out meritless charges filed against them. They said they expected juries to throw them out as well \u2014 though they do worry about the impact protracted federal investigations could have on their lives and finances.",
      "They contend that Patel is simply accusing anyone who declines to carry out Trump\u2019s wishes, Republican or Democrat, of being corrupt or committing crimes. And some have noted that, by having written this book, Patel has likely made it much easier for anyone on his list to have a case against them dismissed on grounds of vindictive prosecution.",
      "Patel and other pro-Trump Republicans say that Democrats, along with DOJ and FBI officials, have weaponized law enforcement agencies against Trump. They say the criminal investigations into whether Trump cooperated with Russia and paid hush money during the 2016 election, tried to reverse the results of the 2020 election and declined to return classified documents after leaving office were all meritless.",
      "Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, said that Patel would end politically motivated criminal investigations, not launch them. \u201cKash Patel is going to end the weaponization of law enforcement,\u201d Pfeiffer said. \u201cThe FBI will target crime, not individuals with Kash leading the bureau.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cKash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director.\u201d",
      "Democrats have said that claims that the Justice Department and FBI during the Biden administration have been politically biased are false, citing recent prosecutions of some prominent Democrats, as well as Biden\u2019s son Hunter.",
      "\u201cThis Department of Justice has brought charges against a Democratic U.S. senator in New Jersey, a Democratic congressman in Texas,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee, said in a CNN interview earlier this month, referring to Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.",
      "\u201cI mean, the deep state, nobody\u2019s ever defined it,\u201d Raskin added. \u201cApparently, it just means anybody who doesn\u2019t do the will of Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Fear among current and former officials",
      "In interviews with NBC News, multiple people whom Patel declared members of the \u201cdeep state\u201d expressed alarm at being publicly labeled as possible criminals by a potential FBI director. All of them said they were not part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and were not part of any secret effort to undermine Trump or any other president.",
      "The former federal law enforcement official who first asked about Patel\u2019s list urged senators to not confirm Patel as FBI director, citing fear that Patel would use the bureau for intimidation and retribution, as longtime bureau director J. Edgar Hoover did.",
      "\u201cKash Patel is a political extremist who has no business coming anywhere near the FBI, let alone serving as its director,\u201d said the former official, who asked not to be named because of concerns about potential retaliation. \u201cUnder no circumstances should he be confirmed for such a position.\u201d",
      "Rod Rosenstein, who served as deputy attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term and who is on Patel\u2019s list, noted that senior DOJ officials, including the FBI director, are supposed to follow longtime Justice Department procedures that call for the facts and the law to drive criminal investigations, not politics.",
      "\u201cWhen I was deputy attorney general, President Trump regularly expressed his opinion about who should be fired or prosecuted,\u201d Rosenstein said. \u201cI didn\u2019t treat his opinions as orders. Lawyers who take leadership positions at the Department of Justice know they need to base prosecution decisions on the facts and the law.\u201d",
      "In addition to his memoir, Patel has written three children\u2019s books in which he appears to portray himself as a truth-seeking wizard \u2014 \u201cKash the Distinguished Discoverer\u201d \u2014 who uncovers plots against a character named \u201cKing Donald,\u201d who appears to be Trump. The characters plotting against King Donald are \u201cHillary Queenton,\u201d \u201cBaron Von Biden,\u201d \u201cComma-la-la\u201d and \u201cthe Shifty Knight,\u201d apparent references to Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Adam Schiff.",
      "In Patel\u2019s third children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Plot Against the King 3: The Return of the King,\u201d the Dragon of Jalapenos, an apparent reference to the Department of Justice \u2014 indeed the dragon is sometimes just referred to as \u201cDOJ\u201d \u2014 is deceived by the \u201cShifty\u201d Knight into believing that Trump is an enemy.",
      "The dragon tries to eat King Donald, but the Kash character helps rescue him and the dragon learns he has been lied to. The book ends with King Donald riding the Dragon of Jalapenos, chasing Baron Von Biden and Comma-la-la out of the kingdom as the dragon breathes fire at them.",
      "A mass exodus from the FBI?",
      "One former FBI official predicted a mass exodus of agents who are eligible for retirement from the bureau if Patel is confirmed.",
      "\u201cI have received calls from lifers who are putting in their papers,\u201d said the former FBI official, who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation. \u201cAgents will continue to do their jobs. They will follow the rule of law and the Constitution. It is the circus that they want to avoid.\u201d",
      "A staffer on the Jan. 6 committee defended its work but asked not to be named because he feared being investigated by Patel. The staffer said the panel's work was fully legal and \u201cconstitutionally protected Congressional activity\u201d but that they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they were criminally investigated by Patel regardless.",
      "They said Patel could \"launch an investigation just to make our lives miserable,\u201d and added that they believe Trump and Patel are trying to send a message: \u201cIf you try to hold Trump accountable for his bad behavior, you\u2019re going to face retribution.\u201d",
      "The former intelligence official said that some members of the intelligence community are concerned about being investigated by a Patel-run FBI and by the GOP-led Congress.",
      "As various individuals are named as potential targets, people are left to wonder, \u201cWhere in the hierarchy of retribution are you?\u201d said the former intelligence official.",
      "A former DOJ official who worked in the first Trump administration said that Patel and Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s current choice for attorney general, in the end would be on a mission impossible if confirmed. He said that Trump will make clear what he wants Bondi and Patel to do and then push them out if they don\u2019t do it.",
      "\u201cIf the Attorney General and the FBI Director seem to resist doing what he makes clear he wants, he will attack them publicly in social media posts and through conservative media pundits, to bring pressure on them,\u201d said the official. \u201cWe saw that with Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, and he will do it again. Ultimately, he will fire the Attorney General and the FBI Director or force them out if they don\u2019t do what he wants.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 22:25:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. is set to remove a $10 million bounty it had previously placed on de facto Syrian leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to remove the $10 million bounty\u00a0it had placed\u00a0on\u00a0de facto\u00a0Syrian leader, Ahmed Al-Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre,\u00a0Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. Sharaa is the head of rebel group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), which\u00a0led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad earlier this month.",
      "The decision follows meetings between U.S. diplomats and\u00a0HTS in Damascus\u00a0on\u00a0Friday\u00a0in which\u00a0Sharaa committed to ensuring terrorist groups in Syria do not pose a threat to the U.S. and its allies,\u00a0Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said.\u00a0The\u00a0high-level\u00a0U.S. delegation\u2019s visit to the Syrian capital was the first\u00a0such trip\u00a0since the fall of the regime.",
      "Leaf, who led the delegation,\u00a0described the meetings with the interim government as \u201cquite good, very productive,\u201d and \u201cdetailed,\u201d covering a wide range of issues both domestic and external. Leaf said Sharaa himself came across as \u201cpragmatic.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing this for some time, some very pragmatic and moderate statements on various issues, from women\u2019s rights to protection of, you know, equal rights for all communities, etc,\u201d\u00a0Leaf told reporters. \u201cAgain, it was a good first meeting. We will judge by deeds, not just by words. Deeds are the critical thing.\u201d",
      "The U.S. diplomats also stressed the Biden administration\u2019s continued focus on determining the fate of detained or missing Americans in Syria including Austin Tice and\u00a0Majd Kamalmaz.\u00a0Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, who\u00a0traveled to Damascus in 2020\u00a0for secret negotiations about Tice during the first Trump administration, was also part of the delegation. Carstens said the information\u00a0available\u00a0thus\u00a0far does not confirm whether\u00a0Tice, an\u00a0American journalist who was abducted in Syria 12 years ago,\u00a0is still alive.",
      "\u201cWhat I can tell you is this, the president the United States said recently that he believes Austin to be alive, and it\u2019s our duty to keep pressing and pushing to see if we can find all the information that we possibly can, to get a sense of, with certainty by the way, what happened to him, where he is, and to bring him home,\u201d Carstens told reporters following the meetings.",
      "Carstens said the U.S. was focused on six particular prison sites where they believed there was a high possibility Tice had been held at one point or another, and that in the weeks ahead it will be the duty of the U.S. to search them thoroughly and \u201cfine tune the evidence gathering in a way that only the FBI can do.\u201d",
      "In addition to HTS, the diplomats met with members of civil society, activists, members of different communities and other Syrians \u201cabout their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cWe met with the quite heroic White Helmets to affirm our continued support for their life-saving efforts and tireless work to transform Syria for the better of all Syrians,\u201d Leaf told reporters. \u201cWe also held a commemorative event to honor the\u00a0tens of thousands,\u00a0Syrians and non-Syrians\u00a0alike,\u00a0who were detained, tortured, forcibly disappeared or missing and who brutally perished at the hands of the former regime.\u201d",
      "Daniel Rubinstein, a senior adviser for the State Department\u2019s Middle East bureau who will lead the department\u2019s diplomatic engagement on Syria\u00a0from Washington,\u00a0said the U.S. hopes to have more regular diplomatic missions to Damascus.",
      "\u201cObviously we need to look at the operational conditions,\u201d Rubenstein said. \u201cWe were able to have a successful visit today, and we\u2019re going to try to do them prudently and as frequently as practical.\u201d",
      "The U.S. delegation\u2019s visit follows trips by diplomats from France, the U.K. and Germany to Damascus this week as Sharaa calls for the lifting of international\u00a0sanctions against HTS, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist group.",
      "Current\u00a0U.S. sanctions,\u00a0including\u00a0the\u00a0terrorist designation, do not prevent the\u00a0government\u00a0from meeting or speaking with HTS, but\u00a0they do restrict\u00a0the provision of material support,\u00a0creating complications for humanitarian aid groups working to assist both the refugees flooding back to\u00a0Syria\u00a0and those displaced within it for the last decade.",
      "The Biden administration is exploring removing HTS from its terrorist list,\u00a0NBC News has reported, but the administration has also laid out a list of conditions\u00a0the group\u00a0must meet before the United States would formally recognize the Syrian government.",
      "\u201cOur view is that when whatever government arises out of this transition, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to protect the rights of all Syrians, including women and minorities, like all governments, it needs to preserve critical state institutions and deliver essential services,\u201d deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday. \u201cAnd perhaps most important, we want to see a Syria that does not pose a threat to its neighbors or the regions or being a place that\u2019s going to serve as a base for terrorism or allying with groups like ISIS.\u201d"

That investigation led reporters to North Texas, where officials had come to treat the unclaimed dead not as an expensive burden but as a free resource.

So Abby and Libby, thank you.\u201d",

      "Defense attorneys also wrote in a sentencing memorandum that Allen has a long history of mental health illness and that he had been treated for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder throughout his life.",
      "Allen, who was a CVS clerk at the time of the killings, was not a suspect\u00a0until a file clerk organizing thousands of tips\u00a0discovered a mislabeled \u201clead sheet\u201d in September 2022.",
      "The document, which had incorrectly been marked \u201cclear,\u201d showed that Allen reached out to investigators days after the killings and said he had been at the same location as the girls on the day they disappeared.",
      "Defense attorneys have said that Allen often walked on that trail and that he voluntarily went to police because he wanted to help in any way he could."

      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Los Angeles health officials are investigating a norovirus outbreak after around 80 people were sickened after eating raw oysters at an event to showcase the city\u2019s best restaurants.",
      "The Los Angeles County Department of Health said that people got sick after attending an event on Dec. 3, and that oysters have been recalled.",
      "Those sickened attended the Los Angeles Times \u201c101 Best Restaurants\u201d event at the Hollywood Palladium, a theater on Sunset Boulevard, the newspaper reported.",
      "The Times event was to be attended by the some of the city's best chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants, the newspaper announced in promoting it.",
      "The recalled oysters are Fanny Bay Select oysters and Fanny Bay XS oysters from Pacific Northwest Shellfish Co. with a pack date of Nov. 25 or later, the health department said.",
      "The recall was issued on Dec. 13. A recall notice from the California Department of Health said that the oysters were harvested from multiple sites in British Columbia. It said the oysters were also under the brand name Buckley Bay and Royal Miyagi.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 18 warned restaurants and retailers in 14 states and the District of Columbia to not serve or sell oysters recently harvested in parts of British Columbia because of potential norovirus contamination.",
      "The Los Angeles County health department said it is continuing to investigate the outbreak.",
      "Norovirus causes vomiting and diarrhea. Other symptoms can include stomach pain, body aches and fever. Symptoms usually appear 12 to 48 hours after exposure, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. It's the most common foodborne illness in the United States, it said.",
      "Oysters and other shellfish absorb the virus in their bodies when sewage gets into oceans and the virus is introduced into the water that the shellfish live in, the Washington state Department of Health says in its warnings about the illness.",
      "A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Times did not immediately respond to a NBC News request for comment late Friday afternoon, but spokesperson Hillary Manning told the Times in its own report on the issue that a Santa Monica shellfish company sourced the oysters and provided it to one of the restaurants.",
      "\"We have produced culinary events for many years and take food safety very seriously,\u201d Manning wrote in an email to the Times. \u201cAs is the case with each of our events, we had protocols in place and, based on an inspection from the L.A. County Department of Public Health, we were in compliance with all relevant safety standards. We also know the care that each chef and restaurant takes in preparing and serving food to our community.\u201d",
      "The 101 Best Restaurants List was created in 2014 by the newspaper\u2019s restaurant critic Jonathan Gold, who won a Pulitzer Prize and who was a local celebrity himself. Gold died in 2018 at the age of 57."

      "Elon Musk has been a constant companion to President-elect Donald Trump as Trump meets with foreign leaders \u2014 an ever-present personality at Mar-a-Lago since November, even accompanying Trump to Paris on his first foreign trip since winning the election.",
      "Musk\u2019s proximity to the incoming president has given him invaluable access to heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron at the ceremonial reopening of Notre Dame and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in New York, referring to her as a \u201cprecious genius\u201d and \u201ceven more beautiful on the inside than she is on the outside\u201d in introductory remarks at a black-tie gathering.",
      "More notably, Musk joined Trump\u2019s pivotal first call after the election with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions with world leaders alongside Trump are raising questions about the tech leader\u2019s potential influence on U.S. foreign policy over the next four years and the potential for conflicts of interest, Washington insiders say. Musk maintains extensive worldwide investments, especially in China, America\u2019s most powerful adversary, and has openly supported far-right political movements around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on a level that is so foreign to me I can\u2019t get my head around it,\u201d a former national security official in President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet said. \u201cBeing in these meetings alone or with Trump, who knows what ethics violations are taking place.\u201d",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said \u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency. The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "Musk holds over $15 billion in federal contracts \u2014 principally through his SpaceX rocket company that NASA has come to rely on for aspects of its rocket program. The Pentagon depends on Musk for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite services, which are critical for U.S. military operations around the world.",
      "Behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Since 2014, Trump has traveled to China at least eight times where he had meetings with senior Chinese officials. In one meeting, he was even offered a Chinese green card by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk met directly with Xi at an exclusive 2023 dinner in San Francisco when he visited the U.S. for a daylong summit in 2023.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla electric vehicles, which account for almost 50% of all EV sales in the U.S., are largely manufactured in China, where the company opened its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d Especially troubling to some is Musk\u2019s prospective role recommending ambitious cuts in federal jobs. The former intelligence official added, \u201cWhen he\u2019s one of the arbiters of government efficiency, and how many thousands of people he can fire, he has all these government conflicts.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s government contracts involve more than 17 U.S. government agencies. This week, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is looking into whether Musk complied with disclosure rules for his top-secret security clearance requiring him to report meetings with foreign officials, citing unnamed sources.",
      "\u201cI think he has incredible conflicts,\u201d the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, told NBC News, adding, \u201cHis association with the president-elect has already profited him as far as his personal assets are concerned.\u201d",
      "When asked if he thinks Musk\u2019s meetings with foreign leaders create problems because of his businesses in China and other countries, Cardin said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a transactional person who\u2019s going into a country to see if he can make a deal.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about Musk\u2019s influence in shaping Trump\u2019s foreign policy, told NBC News: \u201cWe have one president at a time. That president is President Biden.\u201d",
      "Clearly eager to smooth over any friction in the transition, Blinken quickly added praise for his likely successor, veteran Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, whom Trump has announced as incoming national security adviser.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in close communication with the incoming administration,\u201d Blinken said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural on one level for them to have conversations, communications, and in some ways, it\u2019s helpful to us, because we want to make sure that, as I said, we are handing over the baton in a way that the next administration can come in and be running at full speed.\u201d",
      "He did not directly answer the question about Musk\u2019s unofficial role.",
      "Musk has previously expressed an interest in affecting the trajectory of foreign affairs, which could further affect his dealings with world leaders.",
      "For months, Musk has clashed with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling Britain a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d endorsing calls for a new election and boosting a video from a jailed far-right activist. In August, Musk stoked tensions there by saying the country was on the verge of civil war following days of far-right violence.",
      "Musk has supported far-right movements around the world, including in Italy and most recently in Germany, where on Friday he expressed support for the country\u2019s AfD party, saying it could \u201csave Germany.\u201d",
      "In the last several days, consternation and excitement around Musk\u2019s potential influence under Trump reached a fever pitch after Musk initiated a movement that quickly torpedoed funding legislation supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",
      "As some Republicans have celebrated Musk\u2019s successful effort to intervene, suggesting he should be made speaker of the House, many critics have raised concerns that Musk could be acting as a sort of \u201cshadow president\u201d or \u201cco-president\u201d to Trump."

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Heart disease death rates in rural America are rising among younger people, increasing the rural-urban divide, according to research in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.",
    "story": [
      "When Ephraim Trembly found his brother in rural Maryland, John had already been dead for three days.",
      "According to their father, John Trembly Sr., how he died remained unclear, since John\u2019s body was so decomposed that they could only identify him from a tattoo. The coroner found traces of fentanyl, so it stood to reason that John had overdosed, his father said. But the autopsy also showed something else, something more unusual: At 20 years old, John\u2019s cardiovascular system had been destroyed.",
      "Before his death last year, John had spent most of his life in Terra Alta, West Virginia, a town of fewer than 1,500 people.",
      "A fifth of Americans reside in rural areas, and on average they live three years less than their urban counterparts, largely due to heart disease and strokes. And this disparity widened between 2010 and 2022, driven by a 21% increase in cardiovascular deaths among working-age rural adults, according to research published last month in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.",
      "This is the first national analysis of rural cardiovascular health during Covid-19, said Dr. Rishi Wadhera, a cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and the senior author of this study. While heart disease and stroke deaths had been decreasing in both rural and urban communities before 2019, they shot up with the arrival of the pandemic in 2020, reversing decades of progress.",
      "\u201cIt is inexcusable for young adults to be experiencing an increase in cardiovascular death rates anywhere in this country,\u201d Wadhera said.",
      "Dr. Chris Longenecker, director of the global cardiovascular health program at the University of Washington in Seattle, said the findings aren\u2019t necessarily surprising, as cardiovascular mortality has always been worse in rural areas due to a collision of factors, including drug use, poor health and limited access to care. But the study renews questions about what\u2019s driving these widening disparities and what, if anything, can stem the bleeding.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to see their son at 20 years old pass away, when they have their entire life in front of them,\u201d Trembly Sr. said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just not fair.\u201d",
      "Drivers of the rural-urban divide",
      "In Wadhera\u2019s study, he and his team examined death certificate data by age for over 11 million adults. Between 2010 and 2022, cardiovascular deaths increased among 25- to 64-year-olds but decreased among people ages 65 and up. In rural communities, those increases occurred at a faster rate and the decreases at a slower rate than in their urban counterparts.",
      "On some level, these disparities come down to differences in underlying risk factors. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity have all been rising among younger adults over the past decade, with rural areas disproportionately affected, said Longenecker. That\u2019s tied to systemic issues, including lower health education, higher unemployment and not having easy access to gyms and fresh food.",
      "Small towns and rural areas have also been hit particularly hard by the opioid crisis, not only worsening people\u2019s economic conditions but also directly contributing to heart disease deaths, according to Dr. George Sokos, the chair of the cardiology department at West Virginia University. Stimulant overdoses \u2014\u00a0from methamphetamine and cocaine \u2014 have also been on the rise, increasing nearly ninefold between 2012 and 2022.",
      "John used to clean rental houses during the day and businesses at night, his father said. To keep up with the grueling schedule, he turned to methamphetamine to stay awake and work faster. When his girlfriend was in the hospital for a month, John took on her cleaning job as well, all while driving two and half hours every day to visit her.",
      "\u201cHe was keeping up with the workload of two people,\u201d the senior Trembly said. \u201cHis boss had no idea she was in the hospital.\u201d",
      "However, meth is also associated with heart disease and stroke. Chronic use likely ravaged John\u2019s cardiovascular system and perhaps contributed to his death, his father said.",
      "These challenges are all exacerbated by limited access to health care in rural communities.",
      "\u201cWe have a difficult time attracting primary care physicians in our state,\u201d Sokos said, noting that makes it more difficult to prevent cardiovascular disease or intervene early. And that\u2019s not to mention the lack of cardiologists to manage these conditions and treat complex cases. \u201cWe\u2019re unable to get to some of these younger patients earlier enough,\u201d he added.",
      "The Covid pandemic further magnified these issues, with Wadhera\u2019s study finding that cardiovascular mortality rose by 3.6% in urban areas but by 8.3% in rural areas between 2019 and 2022.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic is an external stressor that just made all of those underlying social determinants worse,\u201d Longenecker said.",
      "For example, overdose deaths skyrocketed during the pandemic, as treatment resources were disrupted and people turned to drugs as coping mechanisms. With hospitals stressed by Covid patients and, in rural areas, shutting down at record rates, preventive screenings declined precipitously, as did hospitalization rates for heart attacks and strokes.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just disruptions because hospitals were strained,\u201d Wadhera said. \u201cMany people just feared coming into the hospital or health care settings to receive care.\u201d",
      "Telehealth was supposed to bridge this gap, but evidence suggests that it actually may have worsened disparities, as rural communities without internet access were left behind. Indeed, over a third of West Virginians don\u2019t have access, and of those who do, less than half have high-speed internet.",
      "\u201cMy patients will drive to the gas station parking lot, hook up to the internet, and do a telehealth visit from the phone,\u201d Sokos said. \u201cThe patients want the care; it\u2019s just they\u2019re unable to get that.\u201d",
      "Solutions ahead",
      "In rural America, reversing the rise in heart disease and strokes isn\u2019t a question of innovation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing cutting-edge medical things here; we\u2019re doing robotic surgery that no one else in the country is doing,\u201d Sokos said. \u201cBut what\u2019s just as important is getting to the ground and getting to the patients to deliver basic care.\u201d",
      "West Virginia University has tried to tackle some of these issues by hiring more physician assistants and nurse practitioners, as well as sponsoring visas for foreign-trained doctors that come to the state, said Dr. Jeremiah Hayanga, a cardiothoracic surgeon at WVU.",
      "During the pandemic, the university also stepped in to purchase struggling rural hospitals to maintain health care access across the region, Hayanga said.",
      "For Longenecker, any path forward requires a community-driven approach. To that end, he heads a research network that takes lessons from health care delivery around the world and seeks to apply them to rural communities in the U.S.",
      "One project involves training people who have received addiction treatment to go into the community and do heart failure tests among people who use meth.",
      "Another supplies ultrasound machines to community health workers so that they can check patients for heart disease.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been using this approach in Uganda\u201d to identify cases early and prevent progression, Longenecker said. So, he continued, why couldn\u2019t it work on Native American reservations as well?",
      "In general, the idea is to bridge geographic barriers and bring cardiovascular care closer to where people are, Longenecker said. African countries have done that to great effect, providing HIV care in community settings, and in the United States, blood pressure services are increasingly being provided in barbershops for Black Americans.",
      "\u201cWhat is rural America\u2019s barbershop equivalent?\u201d Longenecker asked. \u201cHypertension care is not rocket science; you can really do a lot of it in the community,\u201d whether that\u2019s the library, church or someplace else.",
      "At the heart of this work is active engagement with rural communities, he said. After all, the experiences of people in the Cherokee Nation will be completely distinct from the Alaskan frontier, or from Black Americans in the rural South \u2014\u00a0a region sometimes called the stroke belt. One key limitation of Wadhera\u2019s paper is that it doesn\u2019t examine race and ethnicity data, or geographic differences among states. But that\u2019s where the work on the ground comes in.",
      "\u201cCan we do actual rigorous implementation science with rural communities? To say, how can we structure health services delivery differently in your community to address these disparities?\u201d Longenecker asked.",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Better health care delivery will certainly help address rural cardiovascular disparities but won\u2019t necessarily address the underlying socioeconomic drivers.",
      "\u201cThis is previously a community that\u2019s steeped in coal mining,\u201d said Hayanga, noting that West Virginians are now struggling as those jobs have disappeared without much to replace them. \u201cWe need to support the local community so that they are able to make a living.\u201d",
      "Still, both Hayanga and Longenecker have hope, seeing new interest and research funding into rural-urban disparities, as well as a greater national spotlight on this issue.",
      "\u201cIn Congress, you have many of these more rural states represented by the Republican Party, which is now in power,\u201d Longenecker said. \u201cI\u2019ll be curious to see how this influences policy decisions around rural health.\u201d",
      "But any change will come too late for John Trembly Sr. and his late son.",
      "\u201cWhat can we do? How can we help? All you can do is just stand back and watch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be nice to have a way where we could help our loved ones more.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Restrictions on gender-affirming care proposed by Republicans in Congress and President-elect Donald Trump could be devastating for transgender youths, doctors say, especially for teens with eating disorders.",
    "story": [
      "Restrictions on gender-affirming care proposed by Republicans in Congress and President-elect Donald Trump could be devastating for transgender youths, doctors say, especially for teens with eating disorders.",
      "Gender-affirming care \u2014 which includes mental health counseling and sometimes puberty-suppressing medication and hormone therapy \u2014 is a critical part of care for trans teens with eating disorders, said Jessie Menzel, a psychologist and vice president of development at Equip Health, which provides virtual mental health care for people with eating disorders.",
      "Eating disorders are pervasive among young people who identify as trans. Many starve themselves or develop other harmful eating behaviors to make their bodies conform to a masculine or feminine ideal. Studies estimate that 25% to more than 50% of trans people have had eating disorders, compared with 9% of the overall population.",
      "Yet transition-related care is increasingly out of reach for minors struggling with gender dysphoria, the acute distress that results from a mismatch between one\u2019s sex assigned at birth and one\u2019s gender identity. Most U.S. medical associations consider transition-related care to be essential for minors struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "Twenty-six states already ban such care for people under 18, and Trump said he will implement nationwide restrictions. Trump has vowed to \u201cstop\u201d gender-affirming treatments for minors and punish doctors who provide them. A massive spending bill the House and Senate passed this month includes a ban on using military health insurance for gender-affirming care for children of service members.",
      "Public opinion polls show that Americans are divided over transition-related care for minors. A Gallup survey published in June found that 51% of respondents agreed that \u201cchanging one\u2019s gender is morally wrong,\u201d although 60% also oppose laws banning transition-related care.",
      "Many people who oppose such care say that minors are too young to understand the risks of hormonal therapies and that they are concerned about the lack of long-term data on potential side effects. Although the effects of puberty-blocking medications are largely reversible, they can cause a temporary reduction in bone density. Taking the hormones estrogen or testosterone, which many trans teens eventually receive, restores most of that bone loss. Gender-affirming surgery is rarely performed on patients under 18, and hospitals require parental consent before they provide any transition-related care.",
      "But forbidding that type of care can also cause harm, and state bans have been linked to increased suicide attempts by trans youths. Additional restrictions could lead more kids to develop eating disorders and make it harder for people with eating disorders to recover, Menzel said.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely going to see an increase in eating disorders amongst these individuals,\u201d Menzel said.",
      "Carsen Rhys Beckwith, 27, of Kansas City, Missouri, said they developed an eating disorder around age 14, as they began developing the curves typically associated with female bodies.",
      "But Beckwith didn\u2019t feel female. They wanted to look muscular and more masculine.",
      "\u201cMy body was developing in a way that didn\u2019t match how my identity was developing,\u201d said Beckwith, who identifies as nonbinary and transmasculine.",
      "Beckwith began trying to change their body the only way they could: by losing weight and constantly working out at the gym.",
      "\u201cIt started with counting calories,\u201d said Beckwith. After a while, Beckwith was subsisting on a single piece of fruit a day. \u201cI would give most of my lunch away to my friends and think, \u2018I don\u2019t need to eat until dinner.\u2019\u201d",
      "Feeling more at home in their bodies",
      "For trans teens with eating disorders, receiving gender-affirming care \u2014 a comprehensive approach that validates a young person\u2019s feelings, provides psychological support and, in many cases, includes hormonal therapies \u2014 can reduce their need to lose weight, Menzel said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for them to be able to have access to somebody who is willing to listen to them,\u201d Menzel said. \u201cJust having someone who is willing to affirm who they are can make such a big difference.\u201d",
      "Puberty-blocking hormones can give trans teens a temporary reprieve from developing more adult bodies, giving them time to explore their gender identities with therapy, Menzel said. Other hormonal therapies, such as estrogen and testosterone, typically taken later in the teen years, can help children grow into bodies that match their gender identities.",
      "Dr. Ellen Rome, a pediatrician and head of the center for adolescent medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s Hospital, said gender-affirming care can help teens feel better about their bodies and their relationships with food.",
      "\u201cWhen a kid is living as who they want to be,\u201d Rome said, \u201coften the eating disorder symptoms are relatively easy to eradicate.\u201d",
      "Although Ohio\u2019s ban allows children currently receiving gender-affirming care to continue the treatments, doctors are no longer allowed to prescribe the medications for new patients under 18.",
      "\u201cThey have taken that tool out of our toolbox,\u201d Rome said.",
      "Starvation as a coping strategy",
      "Gender-affirming care \u2014 like trans rights in general \u2014 has become a hot-button political issue.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump falsely claimed that children were undergoing gender-affirming surgery during the school day.",
      "Tiffany Justice, a co-founder of the influential conservative group Moms for Liberty, dismisses gender-affirming care for minors as \u201cchild abuse\u201d and \u201csnake oil,\u201d and she said her organization is working to ban gender-affirming care for minors in every state.",
      "Gender-affirming care is endorsed by every major U.S. medical association, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Child\u00a0 and Adolescent Psychiatry. The AMA notes that trans teens who receive gender-affirming care have \u201cdramatically reduced rates of suicide attempts, decreased rates of depression and anxiety, decreased substance use, improved HIV medication adherence and reduced rates of harmful self-prescribed hormone use.\u201d",
      "Children who are desperately unhappy \u2014 and unable to delay puberty in any other way \u2014 may take matters into their own hands, said Dr. Jason Nagata, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.",
      "Trans boys, for example, sometimes avoid eating, because they know that without enough daily calories, they won\u2019t begin menstruation, Nagata said.",
      "\u201cSome people will intentionally restrict their food intake to get rid of their periods,\u201d Nagata said. \u201cWe have seen that a lot, particularly when people can\u2019t get gender-affirming care.\u201d",
      "Trans girls also sometimes try to delay the effects of puberty through starvation, Nagata said. \u201cIf they really restrict their food intake, they can prevent themselves from developing facial hair or Adam\u2019s apples.\u201d",
      "Eating disorders can be life-threatening, Nagata said.",
      "Anorexia, a condition in which people severely restrict their calorie intake, has the second-highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, behind only opioid addiction. It can cause abnormal heart rhythms, anemia, bone loss and brain damage. About 5% of people die within four years of anorexia diagnoses. Even with intensive treatment, relapse rates are high. Fewer than half of people with anorexia make full recoveries.",
      "Research shows such state bans on gender-affirming care heighten the stress and anxiety with which many trans people already live. Calls to a mental health crisis line run by The Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent suicide in LGBTQ youths, rose 700% the day after the November election. A recent study in Nature found that suicide attempts among trans youths increased 72% in states that outlawed gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Both trans children and those with eating disorders have elevated rates of self-harm and suicide, Menzel said. If lawmakers ban puberty-blocking hormones, Menzel predicts, more trans teens will look for ways to stop the process themselves.",
      "Finding peace",
      "Beckwith said they owe their recovery to transition-related health care and the support of other trans people.",
      "Eight years ago, Beckwith began taking testosterone, which they describe as \u201clifesaving.\u201d Although they still sometimes need to be reminded to eat more, Beckwith said they are much healthier than they were in college, when they contemplated suicide.",
      "\u201cI still have days when I have thoughts that creep back in,\u201d said Beckwith, a program director at Project HEAL, an advocacy group that aims to increase access to treatment for eating disorders. Thanks to mental health counseling, \u201cI have so much more practice now in rewiring those thoughts and leaning on the people around me who can affirm me and lift me up.\u201d"

    "title": "FDA approves weight loss drug Zepbound for sleep apnea",
    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 22:53:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Zepbound, Eli Lilly\u2019s weight loss drug, can now be used to treat obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, the FDA said.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration expanded the approval of weight loss drug Zepbound to treat obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity, the drugmaker Eli Lilly said Friday. The decision makes it the first drug treatment for the disorder, which affects about 39 million adults in the United States.",
      "Zepbound, which shares the same active ingredient as Lilly\u2019s diabetes drug Mounjaro, is already approved by the FDA to treat adults who are overweight or have obesity.",
      "The expanded approval could persuade more insurance companies \u2014 which have been reluctant to cover the expensive weight loss drugs \u2014 to pay for the medication.",
      "\u201cToo often, OSA [obstructive sleep apnea] is brushed off as \u2018just snoring\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s far more than that,\u201d Julie Flygare, president and CEO of Project Sleep, a nonprofit group that raises awareness of sleep health, said in a statement.",
      "Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep, cutting off airflow throughout the night. Often a person is jolted awake gasping for oxygen, contributing to fragmented, poor sleep. Obesity, which can narrow the airway, is one of the leading contributors to sleep apnea. Left untreated, it can lead to diabetes, heart arrhythmias, heart failure, stroke and brain damage.",
      "A study of more than 4,000 people presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s annual meeting in April found people with sleep apnea may also be more likely to have memory or thinking problems.",
      "The approval supports evidence that GLP-1 drugs improve overall health along with weight loss. In March, the FDA approved Wegovy, from Novo Nordisk, to reduce heart disease risk. Other studies are underway to determine whether GLP-1s can help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s, curb addiction and delay kidney disease.",
      "It is unclear how Zepbound helps people with sleep apnea \u2014 whether it is through weight loss or because tirzepatide, its active ingredient, is doing something else in the body. The approval is based on two trials of men and women with obesity and moderate to severe sleep apnea.",
      "In Lilly's sleep apnea research, people who took Zepbound lost around 20% of their body weight on average.",
      "Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, said that when people with sleep apnea lose weight, their symptoms generally improve.",
      "\u201cBut as we\u2019ve seen, weight loss without medication is hard to do,\u201d Spratt said.",
      "Other sleep apnea treatments",
      "Many people who have sleep apnea go undiagnosed and untreated.",
      "Currently, obstructive sleep apnea is managed with PAP, or positive airway pressure, machines, which gently blow air into the airway to keep it from collapsing. CPAP, or continuous positive airway pressure, is the most commonly prescribed form of PAP.",
      "Dr. Timothy Morgenthaler, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic, noted that CPAP machines work quickly, have few health complications and are usually inexpensive.",
      "Over the last few years, however, patients have been frustrated after a major CPAP manufacturer, Phillips Respironics, recalled millions of its machines in 2021 after it found that its noise-canceling foam could break down and be inhaled.",
      "Some patients do not tolerate CPAP machines well, Morgenthaler said, leading them to explore alternatives, such as surgery, which is costly, or oral devices, which are not as effective as CPAP.",
      "That has left room for growing interest in drug options, like GLP-1s, he said.",
      "A weekly injectable like Zepbound could free people from an inconvenient machine \u2014 or be used in combination for more effective treatment.",
      "\u201cWeight loss alone can significantly reduce OSA severity for many patients, though tirzepatide may have other mechanisms that could be beneficial,\u201d Morgenthaler said. \u201cHowever, challenges include its high cost, side effects and the need for long-term management plans, which are still being studied.\u201d",
      "How well does Zepbound work for sleep apnea?",
      "Lilly researchers looked at whether Zepbound worked better than a placebo in reducing how many times per hour, on average, a person partly or fully stopped breathing during sleep. PAP machines were not used in the first study, but they were used in the second.",
      "After 52 weeks, the drug had led to an average reduction of 25 events per hour in people who were not on PAP machines, compared with a reduction of five events per hour for people on the placebo.",
      "In people who did use PAP machines, Zepbound led to an average reduction of 29 events per hour, compared with an average reduction of six events per hour for the placebo group.",
      "After one year, 42% of adults on Zepbound and 50% of adults on Zepbound with PAP therapy experienced remission or reduced symptoms, according to Lilly.",
      "The approval is an \u201cincredible step forward,\u201d Spratt said, although determining whether Zepbound is superior to PAP would require a head-to-head trial.",
      "\u201cThe risk of sleep apnea increases with weight gain,\u201d she said.",
      "Morgenthaler said other treatments are still needed, noting that 30% to 40% of sleep apnea patients suffer from insomnia, as well, and that opening the airway alone does not provide relief.",
      "\u201cWe need to realize that treating OSA is not simply about keeping the airway open during sleep,\u201d he said."

      "A major report released this week found that compared with abstaining from alcohol, moderate drinking was linked to a lower risk of death from any cause and a lower risk of death from heart disease, but it was also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.",
      "Far from settling the debate over whether drinking in moderation is healthy or dangerous, the report\u2019s conclusions further muddied the issue.",
      "The report, released Tuesday, was commissioned by Congress and carried out by a committee from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. An update to federal dietary guidelines next year could include new recommendations about how much alcohol people should drink.",
      "The current guidelines recommend people limit alcoholic beverages and say that if they choose to drink, they should do so in moderation, defined as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women.",
      "But over the last few years, mounting evidence has questioned the health benefits of drinking. In 2022, the World Health Organization concluded that no amount of alcohol is safe. A large report this year found that heavy drinking is linked to six cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, the esophagus, the liver and the stomach.",
      "For the report, the committee reviewed research dating to 2010 to look at the relationship between moderate drinking and a number of outcomes, including death from any cause, death from heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, weight changes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cWe looked at that body of literature and were able to make three conclusions with what we call moderate certainty, and what that means is that we feel comfortable in making these conclusions based on the evidence we had available,\u201d said Dr. Ned Calonge, chair of the NASEM committee.",
      "Calonge and his team stopped short of linking moderate drinking to colorectal cancer, saying there is insufficient evidence to make a firm conclusion, though that could change in the future with more research.",
      "Dr. Michael Siegel, a Tufts University public health and community medicine professor, said the cancer connection should be the main takeaway from the new report.",
      "\u201cEssentially, what this means is that alcohol is clearly a carcinogen,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a level of moderate or light drinking that can be recommended to people, because at that level it will increase their cancer risk.\u201d",
      "Dr. Michael Pignone, a professor of medicine at Duke University, said that he hasn\u2019t seen enough evidence to tell people to stop drinking but that they shouldn\u2019t start.",
      "\u201cI am skeptical that low levels of alcohol consumption really reduce mortality or cardiovascular mortality,\u201d Pignone said. \u201cI would not recommend someone start drinking for health benefits.\u201d",
      "A second report conducted by a group within the Department of Health and Human Services to be published in the coming weeks will also help inform the 2025 guidelines.",
      "\u201cI think this report sort of highlights all the things that we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Nicholas Lim, a hepatologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, adding he hopes it will prompt better research to clarify understanding of alcohol and health."

When it goes away, you realize how good you had it.\u201d",

      "\u201cI won a lottery being on \u2018Friends,\u2019\u201d Kudrow tells TODAY.com during a sit-down interview.",
      "Currently appearing in the Netflix series \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy co-starring Ray Romano, Kudrow says that each stage of her career has had its place, but that her time on \"Friends\" was \"everything.\"",
      "\"Anything else I got to do was icing,\" she says.",
      "Though the hit series ended its decadelong run in May 2004, the show continues to live on in the hearts of longtime viewers, as well as gain a new generation of young fans who find themselves irresistibly drawn into the lives of its quirky but beloved characters, Ross (David Schwimmer), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Chandler (Matthew Perry), Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe, played by Kudrow.",
      "After first premiering in 1994, the NBC sitcom would go on to earn six Primetime Emmys (including an outstanding supporting actress statue for Kudrow) and go down in history as one of the most popular TV shows of all time. The meteoric success and continued popularity of \"Friends\" are due in no small part to the chemistry of its six co-stars, something Kudrow says was genuine.",
      "\u201cWe loved each other,\u201d Kudrow says. \u201cGoing to work every day was heaven. It was too good to be true, but it really was.\u201d",

Instead, she attended Vassar, where she graduated with a biology degree and plans for a career in research before trying her hand at comedy. The risk paid off, and after a successful audition Kudrow earned a coveted spot in the Groundlings, a Los Angeles-based sketch comedy group.",

All of them have something to hide, including Lydia and Paul.",
      "\"Their son is dead and it's a secret. What was their involvement in that?\" says Kudrow, who explains that she was initially drawn to the role because she enjoys a mystery.",

I loved everybody. Luke was so great. Linda was great.\"",
      "As for what comes next, Kudrow says she wouldn't mind taking on a \"slice-of-life\" drama similar to \"Scenes from a Marriage\" or other dramatic role.",

      "I\u2019m more of an artist. I am an actress and I\u2019m an artist in general. So I\u2019m not very regimented in terms of timing and social activities and signing my kids up for stuff. I think that Mel is going to be more of that kind of mom.",
      "Mel and Jack's wedding",
      "I think Mel really wanted to move into her marriage without her past and I think that she just got flustered. She got into a moment that she wasn\u2019t expecting. A lot had taken place the night before. She definitely needed a moment.",
      "Jack really sees her and is there for her and is so supportive. I don\u2019t think she wanted to get on a horse necessarily, but it wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world because I think that they were able to really reconnect and ground each other.",
      "I knew it was something that fans were really looking forward to. I\u2019ve seen it and it\u2019s just beautiful. It\u2019s gorgeous and it\u2019s not cheesy. It\u2019s just really sweet.",
      "The whole town and the community all care for each other and love each other and they\u2019re celebrating this beautiful love, this romance. It was really lovely to film. It was a little chilly, but gosh, it was just so beautiful.",
      "It was really important for Everett because he was really stuck in the past and he was stuck on his grief. He wasn\u2019t able to move on for a very long time. And the relationship with Mel was a point in which he was able to find a way to open up to her, find a way to move on from his grief and finish this beautiful song that he had written for her mother.",
      "Now Mel gets to have a new family member, a new parent in her life. And I\u2019m really curious to see how that develops in Season 7.",
      "Season 6 cliffhangers and highlights",
      "I\u2019m on the edge of my seat wondering what Mike and Brie are going to do. To be honest with you, that\u2019s the cliffhanger that I\u2019m most excited to know about. Hopefully Charmaine\u2019s OK. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s OK somewhere. I\u2019m hoping.",
      "But Mike and Brie, I love the choice they made with that one. Oh, it\u2019s just so good. I just thought it gave him as a character and a person so much more ... I don\u2019t know if depth is the right word. But it\u2019s just like, \u201cWho would do that?\u201d There must be so much complexity going on behind his character for him to say that. It\u2019s really interesting. It was such a good scene.",
      "Doc\u2019s cliffhanger is really scary. The threat to the clinic is terrifying and I don\u2019t really know how we\u2019re going to approach that. I don\u2019t know if the birthing center is going to be affected by that. I would imagine it might not be because Mel\u2019s a midwife and I think she can still run the birthing center if a clinic closes. But I mean, you can\u2019t close the clinic.",
      "I\u2019m looking forward to watching how Lizzie (Sarah Dugdale) and Denny (Kai Bradbury) deal with being parents at such a young age. I live in the South and people get married here at like, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25 and they have kids. It\u2019s very common. I\u2019m personally very happy that I waited until I was 34 to have kids. But I see all these young mothers and they\u2019re just crushing it.",
      "The conversation between Mel and Doc at the hospital after Everett has a heart attack was particularly heart-wrenching, so that was a hard scene to shoot just on an emotional level.",
      "Season 7 of 'Virgin River'",
      "I hope to watch them explore becoming parents and what that looks like for them \u2014 the ups and downs of that journey. I found it to be a really interesting journey myself, becoming a parent. I hope that Mel starts cooking more and gets into farming a little bit. I like that for her. Maybe not so much riding the horse but like having a little garden, some chickens, a little kid running around.",
      "But I think that there\u2019s something about the storyline between Jack and Mel that\u2019s really intriguing. I definitely think that Martin and I had this electric chemistry we really stumbled into. We\u2019re so lucky that we had it because we didn\u2019t chemistry read or anything. We just both got cast and met and there it was. We just were really lucky.",
      "I could go on about it. I think there are a lot of different things at play as to why \"Virgin River\" has gone on. But it\u2019s gorgeous, it\u2019s comforting, people\u2019s storylines are personal and they touch upon things that people are going through. They inspire people. This is what I get from fans when they come up and talk to me about the show.",
      "I\u2019m a big fan of sci-fi, so I always want to be on the sci-fi show. I'm watching \"Silo\" and \"Dune\" right now and I can\u2019t wait to watch \"Dune\" later today because it comes out on Sundays. But there\u2019s nothing\u2019s inspiring me about \"Dune.\" But people get inspired by our show and I think that that\u2019s really special."

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"The Six Triple Eight.\"",
      "\u201cNo mail, low morale.\u201d",
      "That was the motto of the 6888th, a battalion that made history in World War II as the first and only Women\u2019s Army Corps unit of color to serve overseas.",
      "The heroic efforts of the battalion are captured in Netflix's \u201cThe Six Triple Eight,\u201d written and directed by Tyler Perry and starring Kerry Washington as the battalion\u2019s commander, Major Charity Adams.",
      "The 6888th was tasked with handling a backlog of over 17 million of pieces of mail, an especially important task at a time when letters were the only way soldiers could interact with loved ones.",
      "\u201cThey were inspiring the soldiers to keep fighting by getting them the letters from home,\u201d Perry said in the film's press notes. \u201cWhen that\u2019s the only way that you can communicate across seas in wartime, it was so important that those soldiers got those letters in their hands. That was life to them.\"",
      "Keep reading to learn more about \u201cThe Six Triple Eight\u201d and the real-life events that inspired the film, which premieres on Netflix Dec. 20.",
      "Who were the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The Six Triple Eight is a nickname for the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only U.S. Women\u2019s Army Corps (WAC) unit of color stationed in Europe during World War II, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "The battalion of 855 women were mostly comprised of Black service members, but also included some women of Caribbean and Mexican descent.",
      "In February 1945, the 6888th was tasked with managing a backlog of over 17 million pieces of mail, sorting letters and packages that filled three aircraft hangars.",
      "It was a formidable job, especially given that so many letters were improperly addressed, or addressed to common names like \u201cRobert Smith,\u201d according to the Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee.",
      "The women devised an efficient system for sorting the mail and worked round-the-clock shifts in Birmingham, England. They had minimal heating despite freezing conditions and, due to the threat of air raids, they worked in aircraft hangars with blacked-out windows, making visibility difficult.",
      "In addition to the physical challenges, they faced racism and misogyny within the Army. According to the battalion\u2019s historical committee, they were not \u201callowed to sleep, shower or eat in the same facilities as the other female personnel and soldiers.\u201d",
      "The battalion was commanded by Maj. Charity Adams (later Lt. Col. Charity Adams Earley), the first Black woman to serve as an officer in the WAC. By the time the war ended, Adams was the highest-ranking Black woman in the U.S. Army.",
      "The 6888th battalion was given six months to complete their task, but they finished in 90 days. After they completed their mission in England, the battalion was relocated to France.",
      "How accurate is Tyler Perry\u2019s \u2018The Six Triple Eight\u2019 movie?",
      "The movie\u2019s protagonists are based on real people from the 6888th. Kerry Washington\u2019s character, Maj. Charity Adams, was based on the battalion\u2019s real-life leader.",
      "Several moments from the movie are taken directly from documented and real-life events. Washington tells TODAY.com that one of those real-life moments was when Adams was confronted by a superior officer who told her he would send a white officer to show her how to run her unit, to which Adams replied, \"Over my dead body.\"",
      "\"There are so many courageous moments that happened in the script that I then read in (Adams') memoir,\" Washington, who serves as an executive producer on the film, says. \"I think that was like a wonderful surprise to me, that we really were going to be presenting this story in a way that was so rooted in truth and in their lived experience.\"",
      "Washington also shares that similar to the film, Adams was \"threatened with being court-martialed.\"",
      "\"In real life, she was court-martialed,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"But because, as she says to the chaplain (in the film), 'I\u2019ve learned these laws and rules of the army inside and out,' she was able to win her court-martial, maintain her status and her position in the army. And she went on to earn multiple degrees on the GI Bill.\"",
      "Lena Derriecott King, played by Ebony Obsidian, was also a veteran of the battalion who helped Perry with his research.",
      "\u201cI met her when she was 99 years old. I didn't know what to expect,\" Perry told Hoda on TODAY Dec. 17. \"I wanted to ask her about the 6888 before I started writing. When she comes down the stairs -- comes down to sit and talk to me, I'm like, 'Is she going to be in the right mind? Is she OK?'\"",
      "Perry said his clear interaction with King quickly washed away all of his concerns. \"99 and sharp as a tack. She told me these incredible stories. Her recall and memory was so great that when I ran it by a historian, he was blown away that she could recall that much.\"",
      "Perry was able to show King a rough cut of the movie before she died at 100 in January 2024, and the filmmaker said she \u201cloved it.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was saluting the screen. She was laughing. But at the end of it, it was so powerful,\u201d he said, according to Netflix\u2019s Tudum. \u201cShe was in tears. She just said, \u2018Thank you so much for letting the world know that we contributed.\u2019\u201d",
      "Several other characters in the film are based on real-life figures,  including Oprah Winfrey\u2019s character, civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune, as well as President Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, played by Sam Waterston and Susan Sarandon.",
      "While much of the film closely follows historical events, Perry revealed he did take one creative liberty toward the end of the film, when the entire battalion is applauded and saluted.",
      "\"That salute didn\u2019t happen. It didn\u2019t happen until many, many, many years later,\" Perry told the audience at a recent screening of the film, attended by TODAY.com.",
      "\"So the liberty that I took at the end was having everyone of them be saluted,\" he continued. \"They all are saluted as they walk in because they represent all 855 to me. And you see them walking through this door into a new life, into a new future.\"",
      "What happened to the Six Triple Eight?",
      "The 6888th disbanded in 1946 and did not receive public recognition in the immediate aftermath of World War II.\u00a0According to Washington, there were even rumors when they returned home that they \"were only sent over to be concubines to the Black soldiers.\"",
      "\"This rumor got started to kind of diminish their legacy,\" Washington tells TODAY.com. \"So a lot of women when they came back, not only were they not celebrated, but they didn\u2019t talk about what they did.\"",
      "In recent years, however, the battalion\u2019s work has been honored on a national level. In 2018, a monument to the 6888th was erected in Leavenworth, Kansas, and in 2022, the battalion was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Six of the members from the battalion who were alive at the time received the honor.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. Army also changed the name of the Fort Lee Army base in Virginia to Fort Gregg-Adams, in honor of Lt. Col. Charity Adams and Lt. Gen. Arthur Gregg, the first Black officer in the U.S. Army to reach the rank of lieutenant general.",
      "As of 2024, there are two remaining members of the 6888th: Fannie McClendon and Anna Mae Robertson."

      "One week after the conclusion of her record-breaking worldwide tour and days after she turned 35, Taylor Swift joined Brittany and Patrick Mahomes and friends for what appears to be an extravagant \u201cEras Tour\u201d-themed party.",
      "On Dec. 18, Brittany Mahomes uploaded pictures from the get together to Instagram, which included glimpses of Swift and the other attendees in their \u201cEras Tour\u201d outfits. Each guest appeared to dress in costumes similar to the intricate pieces Swift wore onstage that reflected the aesthetics of her 11 albums.",
      "In the first picture, Brittany Mahomes is seen posing alongside her husband in a sequined fringe mini dress with matching knee-high silver boots and a fringed silver and black jacket \u2014 an ensemble that could easily fit in Swift\u2019s \u201cMidnights\u201d or \u201cFearless\u201d eras.",
      "As for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback, there was no denying which Swift album inspired his look. He sported a black suit, matching top hat and white bow tie that made him resemble one of Swift\u2019s dancers during the \u201cI Can Do It With A Broken Heart\u201d performance of her concert. His costume was similar to the look teammate Travis Kelce wore in July when he joined his girlfriend onstage during one of her London concerts.",
      "In another photo in the slideshow, Patrick Mahomes sweetly kisses his wife on the cheek.",
      "The rest of the post featured pictures of Swift, who donned a little black dress and an \u201cEras Tour\u201d friendship bracelet on her arm. In one snap, the \u201cFortnight\u201d singer sipped from her drink beside Brittany Mahomes and Lyndsay Bell, wife of former Chiefs tight end Blake Bell, who wore a\u00a0sequined pink long-sleeved dress perfect for the \u201cSpeak Now\u201d or \u201cLover\u201d eras.",
      "For the final photo, Ashley Avignone, longtime friend of Swift, joined the trio and posed with a stuffed toy snake around her neck, an obvious nod to the \u201cReputation\u201d era.",
      "Fans applauded the commitment to the theme in the comments.",

      "The \u201cEras Tour\u201d began in March 2023 and ran for almost two years, spanning across five continents for 149 shows.",
      "\u201cThis tour has been the adventure of a lifetime, and I speak on behalf of my band, my crew, who all left their families and spent time away from everything they know and love and performed when they were sick, when anything was going on in their lives, they made sure this show happened for you,\u201d Swift told the crowd during her final performance as she expressed her gratitude.",

      "The Season 3 finale of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Ultimatum\u201d ended with two unexpected breakups and two proposals.",
      "In a season that included four early departures and a heated late-night confrontation between two contestants, the finale, out Dec. 18, featured one more chaotic moment that caught a cast member off guard.",
      "On \u201cUltimatum Day,\u201d the final day of the experiment when couples must decide if they want to break up, get engaged or leave with someone new, fans watched contestants Nick Tramontin and Sandy Gallagher unpack their tumultuous time on the show.",
      "During the experiment, Nick, who had issued the ultimatum to Sandy, spiraled while she developed a close bond with fellow contestant Jon Richard \u201cJ.R.\u201d Warren. Nick processed his emotions alone as his trial marriage partner, Vanessa Hattaway, was one of four cast members who quit the experiment in Episode 4.",
      "Sandy tells TODAY.com that Nick tackling the process solo was \u201cdetrimental\u201d to their relationship, which never recovered when the two reunited for their trial marriage.",
      "\u201cIt damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I,\u201d she shares.",
      "Looking back at her time on the Netflix series, she says, \u201cMaybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before.\u201d",
      "Despite the two repeatedly expressing their love for each other, she told him on \u201cUltimatum Day\u201d that they still had unresolved issues. She opted to leave alone after he appeared to reach for a ring, ready for a proposal.",
      "But Sandy reveals to TODAY.com that that isn\u2019t what really happened. Below, Sandy shares how their breakup unfolded, in her eyes. She also discusses fans\u2019 reactions to her \u201csurface-level\u201d relationship with J.R., if she has spoken to him or Nick since the show ended, unaired conversations and her biggest regrets.",
      "Somebody actually reached out to me about it, and I had originally said, \u201cNo.\u201d I was like, \u201cNope, that sounds too intense. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re at the place in our relationship where we\u2019re ready to get engaged by any means.\u201d Nick, he perked up. He was like, \u201cNo, I would actually really like to do that with you.\u201d We went through the process, very nonchalant, and we got it. I\u2019m a very firm believer in that everything happens for a reason.",
      "Yes. I think everybody wanted to leave at some point. It\u2019s a really difficult process, specifically when you move in with your trial partner. I know it looks all like rainbows and butterflies with me and J.R, but it was really challenging. First, moving in with somebody new, and being away from your partner, and then having their emotions and reactions mixed with it. It\u2019s really difficult. There were multiple points throughout that I considered leaving, too. But I think when we agreed to it, we committed. That\u2019s kind of the mentality that I had going into it and I think maybe a little too much, honestly. Because there were a lot of things where maybe Nick and I should have left. We should have walked away because it was really challenging and things unfolded in a way that they never had before. We didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Production didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Nobody knew what to do. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing unfold. It was very messy.",
      "That was really upsetting and difficult. Because we\u2019re like, \u201cHow is this going to work if Nick is by himself and I\u2019m in this trial marriage with J.R.?\u201d That\u2019s literally a recipe for disaster on so many different levels. Nick and Mariah had the option to also match up, which, to be honest, they probably should have. Because it was very detrimental that Nick was fully by himself during it. We\u2019re not supposed to be communicating, we\u2019re not supposed to be talking and it just completely spiraled. I was not happy. I wanted Nick to have that experience. I actually wanted to see how it would make me feel to have him in a trial marriage with somebody. (He) and Vanessa really had a legit connection. I don\u2019t know what would have happened if she had stayed. The experiment didn\u2019t go the way it was supposed to go.",
      "I was communicating with Nick. I did see him a couple times and talked to him for hours and hours and hours about everything. Made sure that I was reassuring him. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations around the whole process. Unfortunately when you get there, immediately you get broken up and you\u2019re in a trial marriage. You have to go through that whole thing before you can then go back with your original partner. So I was trying to let him know, \"We\u2019re really here for the second half of this.\" But I think what unfolded during the trial marriage \u2014 it damaged the whole experience and relationship with Nick and I. We were communicating, but then the communication got very much out of hand on his end. I had to lay boundaries for myself and he was not respecting those boundaries.",
      "I\u2019ve seen him act that way several times in our relationship. It\u2019s a pattern that he has. I know the state that he was in \u2014 emotional, mental, physical \u2014 and I\u2019ve learned to disengage when he\u2019s in that state. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing when I don\u2019t go out and talk to him. Why would I talk to him? He\u2019s intoxicated. He\u2019s very emotional. This is also after \u2014 which we don\u2019t see because this was not caught on camera \u2014 he had called me over 100 times that night and then showed up at the apartment. So it\u2019s like, he\u2019s not respecting my boundaries in the slightest. He\u2019s actually making it almost impossible for me to disengage from that behavior. I knew what was going on because I\u2019ve seen it before many, many times.",
      "Nick is at the door. J.R. immediately goes to the door. He\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t answer it. I\u2019m answering the door.\u2019 They\u2019re getting in a fight over me and I\u2019ve never been in that position before. So that was different, but I\u2019ve seen Nick in that state of mind many times.",
      "It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way \u2014 setting boundaries and sticking to my boundaries. I had these boundaries around (his) level of communication and how it\u2019s unhealthy and inappropriate in a lot of moments. Again, we don\u2019t see that. I do not blame viewers for not understanding because we don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s on my phone. It\u2019s also really difficult for me to deny somebody that I genuinely love and care for so much support when they need it. I would be there for him in a lot of ways and I think that\u2019s maybe what he\u2019s talking about to J.R. at the guys\u2019 night. I (was) expressing to him (that) I love him and I miss him and I want him to be OK. I\u2019m trying to get him through this so we can get to the other side and do our portion together. I don\u2019t really know how to handle the emotions and the behavior sometimes. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s best. I\u2019ve had to learn that through this. Through my relationship with Nick \u2014 before, during and after the show \u2014 genuinely, I\u2019ve learned a lot about setting boundaries and really sticking to it.",
      "Viewers are missing just about everything in terms of me and J.R.\u2019s emotional (and) mental connection. We don\u2019t see it at all. I don\u2019t blame anybody for thinking that me and J.R. (had) a purely surface-level physical connection. Our flirtiness completely outpowers the other stuff that we talked about because it\u2019s just not shown. I get it. It\u2019s OK. It is a TV show and there\u2019s only so much (they) could show. But me and J.R., we had a lot in common. The first conversation that we had, I was like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u2019\u201dWe both have roots in Philadelphia. We both went to the same college, which was a pretty random college. We had the same major in college, which was a very random major. We had a lot of the same beliefs in terms of spirituality, goals and ambitions. I\u2019ve probably talked to J.R. more than I\u2019ve talked to most people about every topic you can think about.",
      "I wouldn\u2019t say it was just a friendship and I didn\u2019t say that it was a friendship. I was trying to explain to her that, \"This is not a real life relationship because this is not a real-life situation. This is an experiment that we\u2019re in.\" Yes, we had a real attraction and connection. I\u2019m not dismissing that. I was just trying to give her reassurance that she quite literally did not ask for, and it was honestly out of line for me to even say anything. I should have just kept my mouth shut. But I was trying to let her know, like, \"We\u2019re not walking out of here together.\" I was trying to give her reassurance in a way that I just didn\u2019t need to. I shouldn\u2019t have.",
      "Me and Zaina actually had a full conversation about that on camera, which we don\u2019t get to see. We do talk through all of it and we clear the air. She knows where I was coming from, but that wasn\u2019t my place to even say that to her. Same thing with the \u201chooking up\u201d comment because we all have different definitions of hooking up, including me and Zaina. Me and J.R. had only kissed a couple times and what I consider hooking up is more than kissing. I was out of line for even saying anything in that space. As a girl, that crushes me because I was not trying to play her. I was trying to be brutally honest, and it came off the wrong way.",
      "Leading up to that, I think we both came to an agreement that it would not be responsible or smart for us to get engaged at that point. There\u2019s a lot more things that we (needed) to work on and things that came up through this process that we\u2019re probably not the right life partners for each other. He had told me that he wasn\u2019t going to propose. So when I saw him reaching in his pocket, I was surprised. That\u2019s why I was like, \"What are you doing?\" Because I didn\u2019t think that he was. He wasn\u2019t reaching for a ring. He was reaching for something else.",
      "It was really hard. It\u2019s really sad, honestly I\u2019ve had such a special relationship with Nick. I\u2019ve had such a special connection and bond with him, and we are so deeply connected. I know it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I love him so much, like, I really, really do. Anybody that knows me, knows our relationship, knows that love was never a problem with us. The love and connection was so deep and strong. It\u2019s the life that that kind of got in the way. I think the \"Ultimatum Day\" was the end, and we both knew it. It\u2019s really difficult to separate from somebody that you still really love and care about. You have that connection with them but you know that they\u2019re not the right life partner for you.\u00a0 I think this whole process expedites the answer. It did bring a lot of things to light, but I think those things would have come to light down the line anyways. What we can uncover in two months is better than taking two years for it to uncover outside of the experience. We got the answers. It just wasn\u2019t the answer that we were hoping for and it was a really weird, hard way to get there.",
      "It was a real breakup. Just like any other marriage or relationship, there\u2019s a separation process. It\u2019s difficult to really emotionally separate from somebody that you are so emotionally tied to. So it was a little bit of a process, but I was feeling this overwhelming gut feeling we (needed) to separate and this (wasn\u2019t) the right relationship for me. It wasn\u2019t healthy anymore. We still supported each other and were there for each other in a lot of ways. I\u2019ll always love him and care for him as a person. That\u2019s way far bigger and beyond this show and this experience. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to date and get married.",
      "No, actually, J.R. and I did not communicate at all after filming the show. I think it was kind of a mutual understanding, and we actually had talked about it during our trial marriage. That\u2019s why I was so confidently telling Zaina, \"This is not a real relationship. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\" I wanted to leave it in the experience. I gave it my all. It\u2019s this unnatural experience that would literally never happen in the normal world. So for me, in my mind and my heart, that was never an option. I was not going to take that with me, Also, out of respect for Nick and Zaina, we never went there.",
      "I have a lot of regrets and lessons (learned) throughout the whole process. I felt this way the last year and now I can actually see it. There\u2019s a lot of things that I would have done differently. I think I made a lot of mistakes along the way. I\u2019m so aware of that. I\u2019m not denying that at all. I think, for one, just my overall kind of the lack of respect that I\u2019m sensing from myself towards Nick, and the resentment that I was carrying from our relationship into the show. That\u2019s pretty apparent to me. Regardless of whatever happened in my relationship, I just don\u2019t want to be showing up for my partner, myself in that way. It\u2019s not who I am to my core. I do think that leaning into the process with J.R. as quick as we did was honestly inappropriate. I don\u2019t think that that was \u2018wrong.\u2019 But for me, my heart and my standards, I don\u2019t think that was respectful towards Nick or Zaina. Looking back now, that\u2019s something that I would have done differently.",

      "The reality television star continues, \"So it\u2019s like almost passing a stranger on the street. We run into each other at events and I don\u2019t even look his way, because everything that happened was so disrespectful to the 10th degree.\"",
      "Zaina says she's happy that \"everything came to light\" and she is at peace with the end of her relationship.",
      "\"It sucks that I had to go through that experience, but I feel like sometimes God has a way of revealing things. And it was clear: J.R. and I were not meant to be together and he needed to be removed,\" she says.",
      "The real shock, Zaina adds, has come in watching J.R.'s relationship with Sandy, his trial marriage partner. On camera, J.R. and Sandy were open about developing feelings for each other and shared two kisses. This, however, was news to Zaina.",
      "\"When we switched back over, J.R. was very much so, like, \u2018Nothing happened. Sandy was the one that initiated everything.\u2019 He was saying all these things to downplay everything to the point where I believed him, and I was just like, 'There\u2019s nothing for me to worry about,'\" she says.",
      "While Sandy had spoken to Zaina about the trial marriage, she says she didn\u2019t know the extent of their relationship until recently.",
      "\"After the show he never gave me closure, or he refused to have real conversations. I didn\u2019t know anything that happened between him and Sandy until last month, before we shot the reunion,\" she says.",
      "Since the show, Zaina has been supported by family, who are \"very upset\" on her behalf.",
      "\"They\u2019re thanking God I\u2019m out of that toxic situation. They\u2019re just pouring a lot of love into me, but also like, \u2018Please, just stay away from him,'\" she says.",
      "At the reunion, which aired Dec. 18, J.R. told his side of the story, saying that Zaina was upset about the time they spent broken up after the show and did not want J.R. to date other people.",
      "\u201cI told her I needed time to process things, and she wanted to go back to what we were doing, and ignore the whole experience, and get back together,\u201d J.R. said. \u201cWe\u2019re not together. I feel like if we really want to realize what we want out of our relationship, we do need to take this time apart. I think you were upset about that.\u201d",
      "Zaina clarified that after their breakup, they lived across the street from each other while continuing to talk and spend time together.",
      "\u201cNaturally, I was really confused and he refused to give me any type of closure,\u201d Zaina said. \u201cI would ask, \u2018OK, during this break, are we seeing other people?\u2019 That\u2019s a valid question to ask. That was asking for clarity. That is not being controlling.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a lot of love for Zaina. I don\u2019t know where all this hostility is coming from. I\u2019ve helped her whenever she called on me. There\u2019s no time where I shut her out,\u201d J.R. responded. \u201cI haven\u2019t given her closure because I\u2019m still processing things.\u201d",
      "Where is Zaina now?",
      "Zaina says she has \"no regrets\" about going on the show and would do it \"a million times over\" because before she was \"blinded to everything.\"",
      "\"I'm just really grateful for the entire experience, no matter how painful it was and how many tears I shed, and how awful the healing journey was,\" she says.",
      "After the show she went on a \"deep healing journey.\"",
      "\"I just started prioritizing myself. I started really leaning into my passions. I left my corporate job to pursue becoming an entrepreneur on my own.  I\u2019m working on building my own wellness brand. Fitness, wellness (and) self care are the three things that I want to prioritize (as well as) mental health,\" she says.",
      "Zaina added that she is also looking forward to sharing her story with others \"to help them identify when it\u2019s time to walk away.\""

      "As U.S. diplomats arrived in Damascus on Friday,\u00a0Syria's de facto new leader\u00a0Ahmed al-Sharaa will likely have greeted them\u00a0with a clear message: Under his rule, there will be no threat to the West.",
      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",
      "He has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda.",

      "But with a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head and as the current leader of a group that has been designated a terrorist organization by Washington and others, he faces an uphill battle to convince people that he is a changed man.",
      "Sharaa has \u201cbeen embracing a more conventional image,\u201d Joze Pelayo, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told NBC News. \u201cBut I think he needs to walk the talk for that recognition and for that approval to remain sustainable.\u201d",
      "Sharaa has also attempted to present HTS as more moderate, insisting in his BBC interview that it should not be considered a terrorist group because it does not target civilians or civilian areas.",
      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sharaa also promised that a Syrian committee of legal experts would be formed to write a new constitution for the country. \u201cThey will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s saying all of the things that I think Washington and Europe want to hear in terms of a transition leading to a government that\u2019s inclusive and reflective of the will of all Syrians,\u201d said Dana Stroul, a former senior Defense Department official who served in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, how long that will hold? Will he walk the walk and not just talk the talk? And if he doesn\u2019t win in the elections, will he peacefully stand aside for whoever does win? I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now and certainly making clear that they want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they stand up interim governing authorities \u2014 making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing Tuesday.",
      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way.",
      "Born in Syria in 1982, he was among the foreign fighters to cross into Iraq to fight against U.S. forces after they invaded the country in 2003 and was detained by the American military, according to The Associated Press."

      "HTS remains a U.S.-designated terrorist group with a $10 million bounty on\u00a0Jolani. The sanctions do not prevent the U.S. delegation from meeting or speaking with HTS, but it restricts the provision of material support creating complications for humanitarian aid groups working to assist both the refugees flooding back to their home country and those displaced within it for the last decade.",
      "The Biden administration is exploring removing HTS from its terrorist list, NBC News has reported, but the administration has also laid out a list of conditions it must meet before the United States would formally recognize the Syrian government.",
      "\u201cOur view is that when whatever government arises out of this transition, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to protect the rights of all Syrians, including women and minorities, like all governments, it needs to preserve critical state institutions and deliver essential services,\u201d deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday. \u201cAnd perhaps most important, we want to see a Syria that does not pose a threat to its neighbors or the regions or being a place that\u2019s going to serve as a base for terrorism or allying with groups like ISIS.\u201d"

    "summary": "A landmark mass rape trial in France has exposed abuse orchestrated by the victim's husband, and a culture that many activists say is sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 When France\u2019s landmark mass rape trial began Sept. 2, the woman at its center appeared to shrink as she arrived at the stark courthouse in Avignon, her face hidden behind dark sunglasses and surrounded by a cordon of lawyers and loved ones.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, eventually found her voice, bringing into the light not only the inconceivable abuse orchestrated by her husband, who was on Thursday sentenced to 20 years for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious, but a culture that many activists have called sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
      "Another 46 other men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years.",
      "Many here say France will never be the same. How could it be, they ask, after so many supposedly ordinary men \u2014 among them a firefighter, a nurse, a journalist and a retired sports coach \u2014 were recorded committing unspeakable acts on a snoring grandmother.",
      "\u201cIt brings us back to the idea of who we are as a society, for normal men to commit acts that are totally transgressive and criminal,\u201d said feminist, lawyer and author Anne Bouillon. With domestic violence complaints in France doubling since 2016, she said, the Pelicot case highlights the fact that women are most at risk at home, threatened by partners.",
      "For Blandine Deverlanges, a high school teacher and founder of the feminist group Les Amazones d\u2019Avignon and a steady presence at the courthouse, the case has tapped a vein.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much larger than the issue of rape. It\u2019s a question of listening to what women have to say.\u201d",
      "Several feminists wondered whether France is in a second wave of the #MeToo movement, which rippled through the film industry here after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s takedown in 2017 but failed to land the same punch on a broader spectrum as in the United States and other countries. France has a history of defending bold-faced men who act badly, such as exiled film director Roman Polanski. Famous French women like the actress Catherine Deneuve didn\u2019t help the cause by signing a letter that denounced sexual \u201cpuritanism\u201d and defended\u00a0men\u2019s \u201cfreedom to pester\u201d women.",
      "But women say the climate feels different this time. Last week, in another closely watched trial seen as France\u2019s first major #MeToo case, Christophe Ruggia, a little-known film director, was charged with isolating and repeatedly sexually assaulting rising star Ad\u00e8le Haenel, beginning when she was 12 and he was 36.  Haenel, now 35, eventually left the industry and denounced adults who failed to help her. He denies the charges; a verdict is expected in February.",
      "With tempers running high over the Pelicot case, activists are hoping to mobilize that outrage into an effort not only to help victims of sexual assault, but also to transform a society in which 75% of women say they are not treated equally, according to a 2024 government study.",
      "\u201cIn France, we haven\u2019t paid much attention to sexual violence,\u201d said Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host who started the organization Femmes Avec to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault navigate the justice system.",
      "Last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the population of Lille,\u201d R\u00e9us noted, citing the city on the northern border with Belgium.",
      "Much of the discussion has focused on the wording of France\u2019s rape law, which some feminist lawyers say is vague, particularly in cases in which a victim is intoxicated or, like Pelicot, subjected to being drugged,\u00a0known as \u201cchemical submission.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted crushing large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into his wife\u2019s food and drink. She would discover the truth only in November 2020, weeks after police arrested her husband after he was caught recording up the skirts of women in a supermarket.",
      "Rape is defined under French law as an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d committed \u201cby violence, coercion, threat or surprise.\u201d Defense lawyers have insisted that their clients did not intend to commit rape because Dominique Pelicot invited them into the family home, and gave them careful instructions on what he wanted them to do to his wife.",
      "\u201cThis is not American law. In France, you don\u2019t need to have obtained the victim\u2019s consent necessarily to ensure that it\u2019s not rape,\u201d said lawyer Guillaume de Palma, who represents several of the defendants.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d",
      "She said most European countries have adapted their laws and procedures to streamline rape investigations and help victims.",
      "Lafourcade, a veteran magistrate with experience investigating sexual assault cases, was among 500 activists who signed an open letter calling for a consent provision to be added to the law.",
      "But other activists and lawyers say the law is sufficient, with consent implied. Anything more explicit, they say, would force the victim to prove a lack of consent.",
      "Opposing camps do agree on one point: France must overhaul a system that makes it difficult to report sexual violence. From making a police report to following up with a timely medical exam, they agree that it is often a luck of the draw whether a police officer will follow proper procedure or a hospital or an emergency room nurse will agree to take essential DNA samples.",
      "Aurore Hendrickx, 26, a Paris event planner, said she has a few friends who have been sexually assaulted and tried without success to file reports with the police.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, they were almost laughing at them,\u201d she said of the police response, adding that a stunning 90% of her friends have been sexually assaulted or raped. One friend was almost killed by a violent partner.",
      "If police give victims the brush-off, it is often no better at hospitals, where traumatized women are often turned away, advocates say.",
      "Filmmaker Linda Bendali, who has researched cases of chemical submission \u2014 sometimes called date rape \u2014 said a friend\u2019s 23-year-old daughter woke up naked in a strange man\u2019s bed last March with no idea how she got there. Her last memory was sipping a drink in a Paris bar.",
      "\u201cI called the hospital and told them they could see her now. They said, \u2018No, come back tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bendali said, fuming, adding that she \u201cpushed hard\u201d to demand they take timely blood and hair samples, essential to prove whether the victim had ingested drugs.",
      "While the victim is awaiting a court date, that is a rare occurrence. Only 6% of rape complaints are investigated in France. After that, a trial is conducted behind closed doors \u2014 a process that feminist historian Christelle Taraud called \u201ctruly horrible for the victim,\u201d who is often treated badly by the defense lawyers, with no public accountability.",
      "Taraud called it an \u201celectric shock\u201d when a judge reluctantly approved Pelicot\u2019s demand to keep her trial open, even when intimate videos of her were aired. Finally, Taraud said, the public got to hear and see evidence of the horrific violence inflicted on Pelicot, whose show of strength has made her an international icon.",
      "\u201cThey treated her like a piece of meat,\u201d Taraud said.",
      "In testimony that left many spectators speechless, some of the men appeared to be acting out porn film fantasies. One of them, a former firefighter busted with thousands of images of child pornography, gave a thumbs up to the camera during the assault.",
      "The defendants, who met Dominique Pelicot in a now-defunct online chat room called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d told the five-judge panel that they believed the prone woman was a willing participant. Though her lolling head would seem to indicate otherwise, they called the petite woman, often dressed in lingerie, a swinger acting out a \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d fantasy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Dominique Pelicot said at the start of the trial. Slumped in a glass box, he was separated from the other defendants.",
      "Dominique Pelicot\u2019s cache of 20,000 photos and videos included snaps of his daughter, Caroline Darian, naked in bed. While he has insisted that he did not abuse her, Darian, whose book, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again,\u201d will be published in English next month, told the court that she\u2019ll never know what really happened. \u201cDid he also drug me?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWorse still, did he abuse me?\u201d",
      "In her final statement to the court, Pelicot made it clear that she is hoping her humiliation won\u2019t be in vain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes,\u201d she said.",
      "The \u201cGis\u00e8le effect\u201d extends beyond Avignon, where the retired logistics manager is applauded and handed bouquets of flowers. Schoolgirls call her name. Strangers send gifts. In a phenomenon that must be deeply satisfying to the woman who wanted \u201cshame to change sides,\u201d activists say women who hadn\u2019t dared speak about domestic violence and sexual assault credit Pelicot with giving them courage to share their stories.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally because of Gis\u00e8le that I have the strength to talk about it,\u201d said Latika, 33, who is still recovering from trauma four years after divorcing a violent husband.",
      "The beatings she said she endured were only part of the story. Latika said she learned the man she met at age 17, the father of her children, had been feeding her drugs for years. Like Pelicot, there were signs something was off, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cOne night I didn\u2019t drink all of my tea,\u201d she said, and she awoke to find her husband raping her.",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate her allegations.",
      "Latika has found solace as part of an \u201cequine therapy\u201d program at Lucky Horse, a 25-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of Mount Ventoux in the picture-postcard village of Mazan, about a mile from the former Pelicot home.",
      "Marion Vogel opened the ranch with her husband, a psychotherapist who has worked with domestic violence survivors, to help women develop \u201clife skills\u201d by working with animals. They ride horses without saddles and stirrups \u201cto connect body to body.\u201d They learn to trust themselves.",
      "First up for Latika was overcoming her fear of horses. She spent half a year building up her confidence tending to an adorable Shetland pony before graduating up to Z\u00e9phyr, a sleek champagne quarter horse with a white slash between his eyes who is now her favorite.",
      "She brushes Z\u00e9phyr\u2019s silky mane and takes him for rides in the same lanes and fields where, Vogel noted, Pelicot used to take long walks.",
      "Like Pelicot, Vogel said, these women \u201call have something to fight for.\u201d"

      "More notably, Musk joined Trump\u2019s pivotal first call after the election with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions with world leaders alongside Trump are raising questions about the tech leader\u2019s potential influence on U.S. foreign policy over the next four years and the potential for conflicts of interest, Washington insiders say. Musk maintains extensive worldwide investments, especially in China, America\u2019s most powerful adversary, and has openly supported far-right political movements around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s on a level that is so foreign to me I can\u2019t get my head around it,\u201d a former national security official in President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet said. \u201cBeing in these meetings alone or with Trump, who knows what ethics violations are taking place.\u201d",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said \u201cElon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency. The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "Musk holds over $15 billion in federal contracts \u2014 principally through his SpaceX rocket company that NASA has come to rely on for aspects of its rocket program. The Pentagon depends on Musk for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite services, which are critical for U.S. military operations around the world.",
      "Behind the scenes, he has interfaced with leaders that many consider U.S. adversaries like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Since 2014, Trump has traveled to China at least eight times where he had meetings with senior Chinese officials. In one meeting, he was even offered a Chinese green card by Chinese Premier Li Qiang, according to the Wall Street Journal. Musk met directly with Xi at an exclusive 2023 dinner in San Francisco when he visited the U.S. for a daylong summit in 2023.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla electric vehicles, which account for almost 50% of all EV sales in the U.S., are largely manufactured in China, where the company opened its Gigafactory Shanghai facility, one of Tesla\u2019s largest factories.",
      "Asked about Musk\u2019s influence on foreign policy, a former U.S. intelligence official told NBC News: \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about conflicts of interest. Under any other normal circumstance, that would not be permitted, but now we are in a different rule set when it\u2019s Trump.\u201d Especially troubling to some is Musk\u2019s prospective role recommending ambitious cuts in federal jobs. The former intelligence official added, \u201cWhen he\u2019s one of the arbiters of government efficiency, and how many thousands of people he can fire, he has all these government conflicts.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s government contracts involve more than 17 U.S. government agencies. This week, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is looking into whether Musk complied with disclosure rules for his top-secret security clearance requiring him to report meetings with foreign officials, citing unnamed sources.",
      "\u201cI think he has incredible conflicts,\u201d the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, told NBC News, adding, \u201cHis association with the president-elect has already profited him as far as his personal assets are concerned.\u201d",
      "When asked if he thinks Musk\u2019s meetings with foreign leaders create problems because of his businesses in China and other countries, Cardin said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a transactional person who\u2019s going into a country to see if he can make a deal.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when asked about Musk\u2019s influence in shaping Trump\u2019s foreign policy, told NBC News: \u201cWe have one president at a time. That president is President Biden.\u201d",
      "Clearly eager to smooth over any friction in the transition, Blinken quickly added praise for his likely successor, veteran Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, whom Trump has announced as incoming national security adviser.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in close communication with the incoming administration,\u201d Blinken said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural on one level for them to have conversations, communications, and in some ways, it\u2019s helpful to us, because we want to make sure that, as I said, we are handing over the baton in a way that the next administration can come in and be running at full speed.\u201d",

      "For months, Musk has clashed with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling Britain a \u201ctyrannical police state,\u201d endorsing calls for a new election and boosting a video from a jailed far-right activist. In August, Musk stoked tensions there by saying the country was on the verge of civil war following days of far-right violence.",

Party leader Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. He has appealed the rulings.",
      "And in May the party\u2019s top candidate, Maximilian Krah, was forced to withdraw from campaigning after he told an Italian newspaper that the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d One of his aides was also charged with spying for China, and another candidate faced allegations of receiving bribes from a pro-Russian news portal.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:02:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Winners of six of the last seven English Premier League titles, Manchester City has just one win in their last 10 games in all competitions.",
    "story": [
      "Right now, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has the look of Roman Emperor Romulus Augustulus when Rome fell in A.D. 476. He knows his masterpiece is falling, and he is powerless to stop it from crumbling.",
      "Last weekend, Manchester City conceded two late goals in the Manchester derby, or rivalry match, to lose to bitter rivals Manchester United 2-1. City fans inside their Etihad Stadium home sat in near silence. Nobody was angry. They\u2019ve witnessed greatness for almost a decade under Guardiola, but this silence was somber. Absolutely nobody saw this run of just one win in the last 10 games in all competitions coming.",
      "Manchester City has won six of the last seven English Premier League titles and eight of the last 13. It\u2019s a dynasty.",
      "A few months ago it became the only team in English soccer history to win four straight top flight titles. It won the treble (the Premier League, European Champions League and FA Cup trophies) the season before that, becoming just the second team in English history to do so. Everything was going historically well. What could possibly go wrong?",
      "Fast-forward a few months, and City is broken. Badly. It has lost five of its last seven Premier League games. It lost just 11 Premier League games in total over the previous three seasons combined.",
      "This feels like the beginning of the end of Guardiola\u2019s incredible reign as City\u2019s marauding, all-conquering emperor in the most competitive league on the planet.",
      "Can Manchester City snap out of this?",
      "Usually we\u2019d say yes. Given the quality of players it has, the depth of its squad and the manager, after a slow start to a season City usually improves in the second half and kicks on to win trophies.",
      "But this feels different. The current signs aren\u2019t good.",
      "City playmaker Bernardo Silva scolded his teammates for their decision-making late on in the shocking collapse against Manchester United last weekend.",
      "\u201cAt this level, if it\u2019s a game or two, you can say it\u2019s lucky or unlucky, but if it\u2019s 10 games, it is not about that,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of games lately. ... We have to look at ourselves. It\u2019s the decisions that you make. Today, the last minutes, we played like under 15s, and we paid the price.\u201d",
      "And that is the crux of this problem. Guardiola\u2019s \u201ctotal football\u201d philosophy relies on taking risks in possession, piling players forward to have a numerical advantage in the final third and keeping the ball and making good decisions. But what happens when you don\u2019t and you lose the ball?",
      "City always had Rodri, a defensive midfielder just voted the best player on the planet, to plug the gaps, cover cracks, win the ball back and be the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card.",
      "But Rodri went down with a season-ending knee injury in September against Arsenal. That\u2019s when this all started. Rodri\u2019s importance to City was clear, but nobody realized just how much of an impact his injury would have, simply because he has pretty much been ever-present since he arrived from Atletico Madrid in 2019.",
      "City has tried everything to replace Rodri over the last few months, but Guardiola, usually a genius in solving problems with creative solutions, has run out of ideas.",
      "City\u2019s only hope is to sign a sensationally talented defensive midfielder in the January transfer window to plug the Rodri gap. But that would really only paper over the cracks of an aging, injury-hit squad that has so many stars limping over the hill at the same time.",
      "Has a quick collapse like this happened before?",
      "We\u2019ve seen this happen before in European soccer.",
      "Manchester United\u2019s legendary side under Sir Alex Ferguson aged overnight and descended into chaos, and United haven\u2019t won a league title since he left in 2013. Barcelona\u2019s dream team was kept around too long and was left to crumble together as Lionel Messi kept waving his wand to make it seem like an illusion, until it fell apart. Chelsea\u2019s star core eroded quickly in 2011 aside from its sensational last hurrah in winning the Champions League in 2012. Real Madrid\u2019s famed Galacticos wilted in 2008 just as Barcelona\u2019s young stars emerged.",
      "The only saving grace for City is that there is no clear pretender to take its place as the top dog in English soccer. Yet.",
      "Liverpool is early in its new project under new manager Arne Slot. Arsenal appears to have taken a step back this season. Chelsea\u2019s talented young squad is a few years from realizing its potential. Manchester United is in a massive rebuild, again.",
      "Amid all of its struggles this season, City is still within touching distance of the title, and a win this weekend against Aston Villa and a loss for Liverpool at Tottenham would put it just six points off the top.",
      "But from defending better to finding a Rodri replacement to keeping star players fit, it has to knit it all back together at the same time. Now. There can be no more \"under 15s\" decision-making. This topsy-turvy Premier League season has given City a chance to salvage its season.",
      "Over the festive period, City can put itself back in the title race with a favorable schedule before it faces Chelsea and Arsenal in early 2025. If it can navigate the next month without a hiccup, and it still can, there\u2019s a chance City can get itself back in the title hunt. A small chance.",
      "What if Guardiola leaves and chaos ensues?",
      "There is, of course, the possibility that Guardiola, who only just signed a new contract that runs until the summer of 2027, could walk away this season.",
      "He isn\u2019t under pressure from the Abu Dhabi-based owners. Guardiola was the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle when he arrived in 2016. He turned City\u2019s expensively assembled machine into a winning juggernaut while playing soccer in its most beautiful form. Even if City finishes outside the Premier League\u2019s top six this season, it will back Guardiola to rebuild the team and go again. If that is what he wants.",
      "But there is a lot going on at City right now.",
      "It has been charged with 115 breaches of Premier League rules, and that hearing has been going on over the last few months, all while City has been crumbling on the pitch. It\u2019s expected that a verdict will arrive soon.",
      "Guardiola has said multiple times he will stay if City is handed a hefty punishment or even relegated from the Premier League to the lower leagues of English soccer.",
      "But nobody ever factored in that City would be struggling to win a game and look such a mess and that Guardiola might not be good enough for the job. Not our words. His.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not good enough,\u201d Guardiola said after the defeat against Manchester United. \u201cI am the boss, the manager, I have to find solutions, and so far I haven\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far\u201d is the key phrase there, though. It suggests Guardiola, one of the greatest and most successful managers in the history of the game, still believes he can turn this around.",
      "But if this keeps on getting worse, Guardiola may decide to leave before his reputation is tarnished.",
      "City will then be in chaos, with no clear successor lined up and a squad of very talented players all recruited to play in a very specific Guardiola way. Plus, it could be looking for a new manager and rebuilding an aging squad all while uncertainty continues about its future because of those alleged breaches of Premier League rules.",
      "Amid this horrendous run of form for one of the greatest teams soccer has ever seen, there is a very real fear among Manchester City fans that things are about to get a lot worse. When a team starts to crumble like this, it happens very suddenly, and there isn\u2019t a quick fix.",
      "City\u2019s fan base has a notoriously downbeat outlook on the team, and that remains despite all the winning in recent years. But if Guardiola leaves and City\u2019s season descends into chaos on and off the pitch, the gallows humor its fans are famous for will intensify. And it might not mask the pain of what is about to come.",
      "The next few weeks are crucial on and off the pitch in determining how Guardiola\u2019s reign will come to an end. Whatever happens this season, he and City can say quite confidently \u201cveni, vidi, vici\u201d when all is said and done.",
      "For now, one of soccer\u2019s great dynasties is limping on."

      "The haul of new species was also accompanied by another 48 species that are potentially new to science but require further analysis, the report said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the RAP team encountered exceptionally high levels of biodiversity that far exceeded expectations considering most of the study sites were located near communities and towns,\u201d the report said, adding that the findings \u201chighlight the importance of research and conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes.\u201d",
      "In addition to the amphibious mouse and unusual-looking catfish, scientists discovered another type of mouse with stiff, spiny fur and a squirrel only distantly related to others known by science, as well as a new bat and several types of fish, butterflies and amphibians.",
      "While discovering new species of insects and even fish is not uncommon, the most significant takeaway from the report is the documentation of new mammals, said Chris Jiggins, an evolutionary biology professor at Britain's University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing \u2014 to find four new species of mammals unknown to science is pretty impressive. The amphibious mouse is something I\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s quite extraordinary,\u201d Jiggins told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",

    "summary": "Severe malaria is the likely cause of dozens of unexplained deaths and nearly 600 illnesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, health officials believe.",
    "story": [
      "Health officials are narrowing in on the cause of dozens of unexplained deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that a severe form of malaria is likely responsible, based on lab tests so far.",
      "The illness was considered a mystery for weeks. It has killed at least 37 people and sickened 592, according to the Africa CDC. Local authorities previously told Reuters that the death toll exceeded 140.",
      "Health officials in Africa have been referring to the illness as \u201cDisease X\u201d while awaiting test results.",
      "The Africa CDC said Thursday that lab tests of samples taken from 51 people suggest that a malaria outbreak may be behind the cases. Concurrent health issues among the population, such malnutrition and known viral infections, could exacerbate the illnesses. (Malaria is caused by a parasite that\u2019s spread by mosquitoes.)",
      "\u201cThe diagnosis is leaning more toward malaria,\u201d Dr. Ngashi Ngongo, principal adviser to the director-general of the Africa CDC, said at a news briefing.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry told Reuters this week that malaria was the culprit: \u201cThe mystery has finally been solved. It\u2019s a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,\u201d it said Tuesday in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "The ministry did not respond to multiple inquiries from NBC News.",
      "The World Health Organization said testing is ongoing and that it has not confirmed a diagnosis yet. The organization suggested Dec. 8 that malaria could be causing or contributing to the cases. Two days later, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said 10 out of 12 initial samples collected from sick people in the region had tested positive for malaria.",
      "Ngongo said in the Thursday briefing that the Africa CDC still has not ruled out a secondary hypothesis that some kind of viral infection \u2014 combined with malaria and malnutrition \u2014 is largely responsible for the illnesses. Ngongo said that one person who died experienced symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, a life-threatening condition associated with viral infections.",
      "The cases are in a rural part of Kwango province in southwestern Congo, which has limited access to laboratory testing and is difficult to reach by road, according to the WHO. The agency said it takes 48 hours to get to the province from the capital city, Kinshasa.",
      "Malnutrition rates in the province are high, the WHO added, which can make people more vulnerable to serious illness.",
      "Children, particularly those under 5, make up the majority of cases connected to the outbreak.",
      "The most commonly reported symptoms have been fever, headaches, coughing, difficulty breathing and anemia, according to the Africa CDC, with particularly severe symptoms among children.",
      "Malaria is the leading cause of death in Congo, resulting in more than 24,000 deaths each year. It also accounts for 19% of deaths among children under 5 in the country, according to the United States Agency for International Development.",
      "Malaria is caused by a parasite that Anopheles mosquitoes carry; it can spread to humans through bites. Mosquito nets, insect repellant and antimalarial drugs can help limit transmission, and receiving a malaria vaccine prior to infection can reduce the odds of severe disease and death.",
      "Dr. Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa CDC, said in a news briefing last week that the outbreak constituted a \u201cmajor public health issue,\u201d given how many cases had been reported in a short time.",
      "In a briefing Dec. 5, Kaseya noted that limited surveillance and laboratory resources had caused a five- to six-week delay in national health authorities being notified of the illnesses after patients first started experiencing symptoms.",
      "If malaria is the culprit, there may have been ways to rapidly detect it locally, said Amira Albert Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cHealth care providers could have detected it by taking small blood samples and looking at them under the microscope,\u201d Roess said. \u201cAll local clinics should have light microscopes and personnel who are trained to use them to detect malaria and other parasites.\u201d",
      "A local WHO team has been helping health authorities in Kwango province identify cases since the end of November. The U.S. CDC has also provided technical assistance.",
      "Congo\u2019s health ministry has issued a public statement instructing people not to handle the remains of anyone who died after experiencing flu-like symptoms without the involvement of authorized health authorities. The ministry also advised people to avoid mass gatherings and report any suspicious illnesses or unusual deaths."

      "Pelicot, who has become a hero to many in France for\u00a0choosing to waive her right to anonymity and highlight the crimes orchestrated by her husband, added that she had fought the case with her children and her grandchildren in mind \u201cbecause they are the future,\u201d according to a live translation by NBC News\u2019 British broadcasting partner, Sky News.",
      "Earlier in the courtroom, she watched as Roger Arata, the lead judge, sentenced her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to 20 years in prison. He had admitted to drugging her until she became unconscious and inviting dozens of men to rape her over the span of a decade.",
      "Another 46 men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault in the high-profile case, according to Sky News. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years. Collectively, they will serve more than 400 years.",
      "Around 15 had admitted to the facts, although only a handful of the men accused expressed remorse in the lead-up to their verdicts.",
      "In a side room, family members of the defendants watched the proceedings unfold on television screens, with some bursting into tears and gasping as the sentences were revealed, The Associated Press reported.",
      "With emotions running high, some 200 police officers were deployed in and around the courthouse, which was packed with family members of the accused, spectators and journalists from around the world. More than 150 journalists were accredited to cover the trial, which many activists see as a watershed moment\u00a0for women\u2019s rights in France.",
      "Pelicot said she respected the court and its decisions.",
      "While each of the 51 men tried in the case were found guilty, outside the court campaigners against sexual violence said their sentences fell short of what was required.",
      "Calling the terms far too lenient, Marion Vogel, who runs a therapy program for domestic violence and other trauma victims in Mazan, the village where the Pelicots lived, said, \u201cShame hasn\u2019t really changed camps to include the courts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely essential for this high-profile trial to set an example and deliver deterrent sentences, so that every man\u2019s mind would be marked by it, and our society could finally evolve,\u201d she added.",
      "Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host whose organization, Femmes Avec, helps victims navigate the justice system, also said it was \"not a real punishment for most of these men.\u201d",
      "In an earlier hearing, it was revealed that Pelicot only learned of the horrors she endured when police started an investigation into her husband after a security guard caught him filming up the skirts of women with his smartphone.",
      "Investigators told they had found videos on her husband\u2019s devices that suggested she herself had been the victim of a major crime.",
      "While she could have remained anonymous, she called for the trial to be held in public and she instructed her lawyers to fight for harrowing video and other evidence to be played out in open court.",
      "She has previously said she was doing this in a bid to put an end to the \u201cmacho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape.\u201d",
      "Campaigners against sexual violence had been hopeful that Pelicot's case would represent a turning point in the fight against rape culture and in the difficulties that sexual assault survivors often face in obtaining justice.",
      "And in France, some of them told NBC News this week that they hoped to transform a society in which 75% of women said they believe they are not treated equally in a 2024 government study, and where last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the\u00a0National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d"

      "MOSCOW \u2014 The mother of U.S. journalist Austin Tice sent Russian President Vladimir Putin a letter late Wednesday asking for his help in finding her son, who went missing in Syria a dozen years ago.",
      "\"The current situation in Syria compels us to ask for your help in finding Austin and safely reuniting our family,\" Debra Tice wrote. \"You have profound connections with the Syrian government, which can be a great benefit for our unrelenting efforts to find our Austin and reunite our family.\"",
      "\"In this holiday season of peace and goodwill, we respectfully request your assistance in finding Austin and safely reuniting him with our family,\" she wrote.",
      "NBC News obtained a copy of the letter just hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured Debra Tice that Israel would not conduct airstrikes near a secret prison outside Damascus where she believed her son may have been held.",
      "Putin is a longtime patron of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted earlier this month and fled the country to Russia. He and his late father ruled with an iron fist for half-a-century.",
      "Assad's sudden downfall raised the Tice family's hopes that the missing journalist might be in Mt. Qasioun prison, which is under a military museum and has a hidden tunnel that has not been fully explored.",
      "But Debra Tice said she's ready to reunite with her son wherever he may be.",
      "\"We would, of course, be willing to travel to Moscow or any place on earth to put our arms around our precious Austin and bring him safely home,\" she wrote.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Debra Tice said she had no misgivings about asking Putin for help.",
      "\u201cOf course I am reaching out to powerful people, so they can help us,\" she said. \"Russia has had a port there in Latakia forever, so I do think they have the ability\u00a0to know what\u2019s going on on the ground. We are still trying to find out where he is.\"",
      "Austin Tice disappeared in 2012, when he was in Syria reporting on the country\u2019s civil war.",
      "Shortly after he vanished, the State Department concluded\u00a0that he was being held by the hostile Syrian government, a charge that Assad\u00a0denied for years.",
      "Since the civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, hundreds of thousands of political prisoners disappeared into Assad\u2019s sprawling network of prisons and many were tortured and killed.",
      "Both Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have been accused by human rights groups of massacring and abusing their fellow Syrians.",
      "But after the\u00a0downfall of the Assad regime, thousands of prisoners who had been held captive for years have been released. But there still has been no sign of Tice.",
      "A former prisoner\u00a0told NBC News in the last few weeks that he was held captive in a cell across the hall from Tice and saw him alive as recently as July 2022.",
      "But while NBC News has not been able to independently confirm that account, Debra Tice said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cwe were able to verify that he was\u201d there in 2022."

      "Mass graves uncovered in Syria in the days since President Bashar al-Assad was overthrown are exposing evidence of some of the worst abuses since the Nazis, a top international war crimes prosecutor said.",
      "More than 100,000 people were tortured and killed in the state-run \u201cmachinery of death,\u201d Stephen Rapp, former U.S. war crimes ambassador at large, told Reuters on Tuesday after visiting two mass grave sites in the towns of Qutayfah and Najha near Damascus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have much doubt about those kinds of numbers given what we\u2019ve seen in these mass graves,\" said Rapp, who led prosecutions at both the Rwanda and Sierra Leone war crimes tribunals and is now working to help document evidence of war crimes in Syria.",
      "Rapp, who also spoke to BBC News, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Images have emerged showing Syrian Civil Defense crews, known as the White Helmets, recovering the remains of those buried in some of the country's mass graves, with some photos showing piles of bones and skulls in body bags. Past satellite imagery has also indicated large burial sites."

    "story": [
      "Two attempts to assassinate Pope Francis when he made a historic visit to northern Iraq were foiled by British spies and police inside the country, Francis has revealed in his new autobiography.",
      "Francis said that after he touched down in the country's capital, Baghdad, in March 2021, police told him two known suicide bombers were planning to target one of his events in the devastated city of Mosul.",
      "\u201cI was warned as soon as we landed,\u201d he wrote in \u201cSpera\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cHope\u201d \u2014 extracts of which are being published in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.",
      "\u201cThe police had alerted the Vatican Gendarmerie to a report that had come from British intelligence: a woman stuffed with explosives, a young suicide bomber, was on her way to Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit. And a van had also left at full speed with the same intent,\u201d he said in the book, which he co-wrote with Italian author Carlo Musso.",
      "After having been told about the plots, he asked security staff members for an update on the would-be assassins. \u201cThe commander replied laconically, \u2018They are no longer there,\u2019\u201d Francis wrote. \u201cThe Iraqi police had intercepted them, and detonated them.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat, too, was very striking to me. This, too, was the poisoned fruit of war,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the British government told NBC News it would not comment on intelligence matters, and the Iraqi police did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "summary": "A man has been arrested in connection with the assassination of the head of Russia\u2018s chemical, radiological and biological weapons unit, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov.",
    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 A man has been arrested in connection with the assassination of the head of\u00a0Russia's chemical, radiological and biological weapons unit, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, authorities in the country said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cDuring the interrogation, he explained that he was recruited by the Ukrainian special services,\u201d Svetlana Petrenko, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOn their instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received a homemade explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance to the residential building where Igor Kirillov lived,\u201d she added.",
      "Tuesday's assassination was the latest in a long line of acts of sabotage and covert killings to hit Russia as its war in Ukraine grinds on.",
      "At the site of the explosion Wednesday, bent metal and bricks had been blown from the walls, and blood remained in the snow. As people and cars passed by on the busy street where Kirillov lived, some left red roses.",
      "The suspect rented a car and \u201cinstalled a video surveillance camera\u201d so he could broadcast the video online, Petrenko said, adding that the man was from Uzbekistan and in his 20s.",
      "State media, citing video from the FSB \u2014 Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency \u2014 identified the suspect, whom authorities did not name, as Akhmad Kurbanov.",
      "Petrenko said he was guaranteed $100,000 and European residence as payment for the attack, which also killed Kirillov's assistant, Ilya Polikarpov.",
      "The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had already claimed responsibility for the attack Tuesday, although national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan told MSNBC that the United States was not aware of the operation ahead of time and was not involved.",
      "\"We do support and enable Ukraine to defend itself and to take the fight to Russian forces on the battlefield. But not operations like this,\" Sullivan said.",
      "Video Russia's Investigative Committee\u00a0published Tuesday on Telegram showed emergency responders parked outside an apartment building where one entrance was visibly damaged.",
      "Kirillov was killed the day after Ukrainian security services charged him with using banned chemical weapons during Russia's invasion\u00a0of the country, which began in February 2022. Russian authorities have denied the allegations.",
      "It was the latest in a string of such attacks and the most recent move in the shadow war underlying the front-line conflict Russia and Ukraine have been fighting for almost three years.",
      "Last month, the SBU claimed it had assassinated Valery Trankovsky, a Russian naval captain in charge of brigade missile ships in the Black Sea, after his car was blown up.",
      "Citing Ukrainian media, The Associated Press also reported that a car bomb killed Sergei Yevsyukov \u2014 the former head of a prison housing Ukrainian prisoners of war \u2014 in Russian-occupied Donetsk this month.",
      "Russia was accused of sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard aircraft bound for North America.",
      "While the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, its first land grab came in 2014. It was then when Washington and Kyiv began developing intelligence cooperation, with the U.S. espionage community training the Ukrainian military intelligence agency known as the GUR, which has been at the forefront of the country's sabotage offensive, former U.S. officials told NBC News last year.",
      "Amid the grinding attrition the huge Russian army has used to eke out territorial gains in eastern Ukraine, sabotage and assassinations have been two of the unconventional methods Ukraine has deployed to score morale-boosting wins and avoid burning through its limited troops and materiel.",
      "Britain also sanctioned Kirillov in October, punishing him and Russia's nuclear protection forces for using riot control agents and reports that they uses chloropicrin, a chemical choking agent, on the battlefield.",
      "In a statement at the time, the British government said Kirillov was \u201cresponsible for helping deploy these barbaric weapons\u201d and had been \u201ca significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation, spreading lies to mask Russia\u2019s shameful and dangerous behavior.\u201d",
      "But shortly after his death, Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson\u00a0Maria Zakharova defended\u00a0Kirillov, who also held several posts in the Directorate of the Chief of Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense since 2009 before he led the force, according to the state news agency RIA.",
      "\u201cHe worked fearlessly,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova said in a statement published on Telegram.\u00a0\u201cHe met problems head on. For the Motherland, for the truth. Bright be his memory, may he rest in peace.\u201d",
      "She added that he had been \u201csystematically exposing the crimes of the Anglo-Saxons for many years.\u201d",
      "The killings have come during a period when Russian forces have gained momentum in the war with Ukraine, pushing forward in the east of the country.",
      "However, Ukrainian special forces said Tuesday they had killed 50 North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, the first such casualties since the secretive communist state sent soldiers to eastern Europe.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department press secretary, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, said Monday that North Korean military personnel have been killed and wounded in combat operations in the area but did not specify how many.",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Moscow and David Hodari from London."
