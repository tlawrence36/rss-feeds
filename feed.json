      "Lady Gaga gave a free concert on Copacabana Beach Saturday night, the second such show in as many years organized by Rio de Janeiro\u2019s City Hall",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Lady Gaga gave a free concert Saturday night in front of 2 million fans who poured onto Copacabana Beach for the biggest show of her career.",
      "\u201cTonight, we're making history. (...) Thank you for making history with me,\u201d Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd.",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show at around 22:10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Cries of joy rose from the tightly-packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.",
      "Lady Gaga performed her classic hits, including \u201cPoker Face\u201d and \u201cAlejandro,\u201d switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans - many of them young - arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\u201cToday is the best day of my life,\u201d said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \u201cIt's surreal to be here.\u201d",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Years\u2019 Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John\u2019s Day celebrations in June.",
      "\u201cIt brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2013 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\u201d said Osmar Lima, the city\u2019s secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall\u2019s tourism department last month.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall said in a recent report that the show should inject at least 600 million reais (some $106 million) into Rio\u2019s economy.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio\u2019s metro employees danced to Lady Gaga\u2019s 2008 hit song \u201cLoveGame\u201d and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, made a cross-continent trip from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",

      "For her, the mega-star represents \u201ctotal freedom of expression - being who one wants without shame.\u201d",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna\u2019s show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year\u2019s Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state\u2019s security plan included the presence of 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers, and 400 military firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\u201cShe's the best artist in the world,\u201d the 25-year-old said, as chants of \u201cGaga, I love you\u201d in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

      "The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On \u201cLaugh-In,\u201d her most frequent target was Arte Johnson\u2019s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh.",
      "\u201cGladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. \u201cSo when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who\u2019s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused.

      "\u201cI never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,\u201d Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. \u201cI was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.\u201d",
      "Buzzi remained friends through the years with \u201cLaugh-In\u201d co-stars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley.",

      "Actor-comedian Russell Brand has been granted conditional bail after appearing in a London court to face charges of rape and sexual assault involving four women",
      "LONDON -- Actor-comedian Russell Brand was granted conditional bail by a London court on Friday after appearing to face charges of rape and sexual assault involving four women.",
      "Brand, 49, did not enter a plea. He previously denied the allegations made against him.",
      "He was swarmed by photographers as he arrived at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court for his first hearing since he was charged last month with one count each of rape, indecent assault and oral rape, as well as two counts of sexual assault.",
      "Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring told Brand to present himself at the Central Criminal Court, commonly known as the Old Bailey, in central London on May 30 and granted him bail on condition he keeps the court informed of where he is staying, either in the U.K. or in the U.S. He currently lives in Florida but is obliged to attend all future court appearances. If he doesn't abide by the conditions, he faces being remanded in custody.",
      "The comedian, author and \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor, who wore an open shirt and jeans, listened intently to the details of the charges as he sat in the dock. He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and that he understood his bail conditions.",
      "The alleged offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in the Westminster area of central London. The accusers have not been identified.",
      "Brand has been interviewed by police about the allegations, which he denies. Brand has denied engaging in \u201cnon-consensual activity.\u201d In a video posted on X after he was charged, Brand said he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "Brand is alleged to have raped a woman in 1999 at a hotel room in Bournemouth when she attended a Labour Party conference in the town. It is alleged that while the woman went to the bathroom, Brand removed some of his clothing and later pushed her on the bed, removed her underwear and raped her.",
      "A second woman accuses Brand of grabbing her by the forearm and attempting to drag her into a male toilet at a television station in London in 2001.",
      "A third accuser was a television worker Brand met in Soho, central London, in 2004. He is accused of grabbing her breasts before allegedly pulling her into a toilet and orally raping her.",
      "The final complainant is a radio station worker who met Brand while he was working for Channel 4 on a spin-off of the \u201cBig Brother\u201d reality television program between 2004 and 2005. Brand is alleged to have grabbed her by the face with both hands, pushed her against a wall and kissed her before grabbing her breasts and buttocks.",
      "The charges follow a September 2023 joint investigation by British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times.",
      "Known for his unbridled and risqu\u00e9 standup routines, Brand hosted shows on radio and television and wrote memoirs charting his battles with drugs and alcohol. He has appeared in several Hollywood movies and was briefly married to pop star Katy Perry between 2010 and 2012.",
      "In recent years, Brand has largely disappeared from mainstream media but has built up a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories. He recently said he had moved to the United States.",

    "story": [
      "A slab of Brooklyn wall that the artist Banksy emblazoned with a bandaged, heart-shaped balloon is emerging after more than a decade in storage",
      "NEW YORK -- When the enigmatic street artist Banksy spray-painted a heart-shaped balloon covered with a Band-Aid on the wall of a Brooklyn warehouse, the nondescript brick building was instantly transformed into an art destination and the canvas of an unlikely graffiti battle.",
      "Almost as soon as Banksy revealed the piece back in 2013, an anonymous tagger brazenly walked up and spray painted the words \u201cOmar NYC\u201d in red beside the balloon, to the dismay of onlookers.",
      "Days later, someone stenciled \u201cis a little girl\u201d in white and pink beside Omar\u2019s tag, followed by a seemingly sarcastic phrase in black: \u201cI remember MY first tag.\u201d Some think it was Banksy himself who secretly returned to the scene to add the rejoinder.",
      "The apparent graffiti battle didn\u2019t end there. Another tagger also attempted to leave his mark but was stymied by security guards. Today the phrase \u201cSHAN\u201d is still visible in light purple paint.",
      "Maria Georgiadis, whose family owned the now-demolished warehouse and ultimately removed the section of wall to preserve the artwork, says the graffiti pastiche is quintessentially New York.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a war going on,\u201d she said recently. \u201cThey\u2019re literally going at it on the wall.\u201d",
      "The preserved wall, dubbed \u201cBattle to Survive a Broken Heart,\u201d will be going up for sale May 21 at Guernsey\u2019s, the New York auction house.",
      "Georgiadis, a Brooklyn schoolteacher, says the sale is bittersweet. Her father, Vassilios Georgiadis, ran his roofing and asbestos abatement company from the warehouse adorned with the balloon.",
      "He died four years ago at age 67 from a heart attack, which is why some of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to the American Heart Association.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just very significant to us because he loved it and he was just so full of love,\u201d Maria Georgiadis said on a recent visit to the art warehouse where the piece was stored for more than a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s like the bandage heart. We all have love, but we\u2019ve all went through things and we just put a little Band-Aid over and just keep on moving, right? That\u2019s how I take it.\u201d",
      "The nearly 4-ton, 6-foot-tall (3.6-metric ton, 1.8-meter-tall) wall section is one of a number of guerrilla works the famously secretive British artist made during a New York residency in 2013.",
      "At the time, Banksy heralded the work by posting on his website photos and an audio track recorded partly in a squeaky, helium-induced voice.",
      "Guernsey auction house President Arlan Ettinger said it is impossible to know for certain because Banksy works clandestinely. But he said the neat stenciling and wording \u201cstrongly suggest that this was a gentle way for Banksy to put the other artist in his place.\u201d",
      "Ulrich Blanch\u00e9, an art history lecturer at Heidelberg University in Germany, called the piece a \u201cvery well executed\u201d stencil notable partly because of Banksy's decision to place it in Brooklyn\u2019s port area of Red Hook.",
      "\u201cThis part of NYC was not easy to reach at that time,\u201d he said by email. \u201cBanksy wanted people to go to places in NYC they never have seen and love them as well.\u201d",
      "But Blanche questioned whether the additional stenciled text was truly the work of Banksy, saying the word choice and design don\u2019t appear to comport with the artist\u2019s style at the time.",
      "\u201cTo call a graffiti guy a \u2018girl\u2019 is not something Banksy would do in 2013. This is misogynic and immature in a sexist way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThree different fonts that do not match and three colors \u2014 why should he do that? Too unnecessarily elaborated without reasons. So I think this was added by someone else.\u201d",
      "Blanch\u00e9 also said he is ambivalent about the pending sale, noting Banksy usually doesn't authorize his street pieces for sale. At the same time, he understands the burden placed on property owners to protect and maintain them.",
      "\u201cBanksy\u2019s works should be preserved, but for the community they were made for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should not be turned into goods. They are made and thought for a specific location. Not portable. Not sellable.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for Banksy didn't respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Maria Georgiadis\u2019 brother, Anastasios, said his father had also hoped to keep the piece in Red Hook after having cut it out of the wall and framed in thick steel for safekeeping.",
      "The elder Georgiadis, he said, envisioned the work as the centerpiece of a retail and housing development on the property, a dream he didn't realize. The property has since been sold off by the family.",
      "Ettinger said it is difficult to say what the piece might fetch. There is little precedent for a sale of a Banksy piece of this size, he said.",
      "In 2018, a canvas that was part of Banksy's \u201cGirl With Balloon\u201d series sold in London for 1.04 million pounds ($1.4 million), only to famously self-destruct in front of a stunned auction crowd.",
      "Maria Georgiadis said she hopes whoever buys the \u201dBroken Heart\u201d finds the same beauty and meaning her father drew from the piece.",
      "When Banksy painted it, the family business had been recovering from destructive floods caused by Hurricane Sandy the prior year. Georgiadis recalls her father had no idea who Banksy was but was moved by the simple image.",
      "\u201cMy dad had it in his head that Banksy knew what we went through,\u201d she said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018Can you believe it Maria? It\u2019s a heart.\u2019\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aiming to slash public subsidies to PBS and NPR as he alleged \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting.",
      "The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\" and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The White House, in a social media posting announcing the signing, said the outlets \u201creceive millions from taxpayers to spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\u201d",
      "It's the latest move by Trump and his administration to utilize federal powers to control or hamstring institutions whose actions or viewpoints he disagrees with. Since taking office, Trump has ousted leaders, placed staff on administrative leave and cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to artists, libraries, museums, theaters and others, through takeovers of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has also pushed to withhold federal research and education funds from universities and punish law firms unless they agreed to eliminate diversity programs and other measures Trump has found objectionable.",
      "The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and have been preparing for the possibility of stiff cuts since Trump's election, as Republicans have long complained about them.",
      "Paula Kerger, PBS\u2019 CEO and president, said in a statement last month that the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rescind funding for public media would \u201cdisrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThis public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.\u201d",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting sued Trump earlier this week over his move to fire three members of its five-person board, contending that the president was exceeding his authority and that the move would deprive the board of a quorum needed to conduct business.",
      "Just two weeks ago, the White House said it would be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. That package, however, which budget director Russell Vought said would likely be the first of several, has not yet been sent to Capitol Hill.",
      "The move against PBS and NPR comes as his administration has been working to dismantle the U.S. Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which were designed to model independent news gathering globally in societies that restrict the press. Those efforts have faced pushback from federal courts, who have ruled in some cases that the Trump administration may have overstepped its authority in holding back funds appropriated to the outlets by Congress.",

      "Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong had just used \u201cFront to Back\u201d \u2014 a song from Hauldren's electronic music group, Levity \u2014 as his walkup music in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.",

      "Sure enough, it was true. Hauldren confirmed the authenticity of the moment through a tangential connection to the emerging star.",

      "\u201cMy girlfriend, her cousin and her sister actually all just went to go watch them in Arizona,\u201d Crow-Armstrong said. \u201cI had already been talking about making one of their songs my walkout, so I just decided to do it.\u201d",
      "Crow-Armstrong, a 23-year-old Southern California native, also uses Larry June's \u201cStill Boomin\u201d for his walkup song. He said he isn't a big fan of dubstep \u2014 the subset of electronic dance music where Levity lands most of the time \u2014 but he likes Levity's stuff.",
      "Music is a prominent part of Crow-Armstrong's daily routine, and he enjoys the process of picking a walkup song.",
      "\u201cMusic\u2019s the best thing ever. I mean, literally, universally, it is the best thing ever,\u201d he said.",
      "Hauldren, 26, has a similar opinion when it comes to Crow-Armstrong\u2019s baseball team. Hauldren is the youngest of four siblings in a White Sox family from suburban Chicago. He grew up going to White Sox games on the South Side.",
      "But he was always a Cubs fan.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of stuck, and a lot of my friends were Cubs fans, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo thankfully my dad would suck up his pride or whatever you would call it and take me to a Cubs game every once in a while.\u201d",
      "The beginning of Levity goes back to Hauldren and Carberry connecting at the University of Iowa in 2017. They met Josh Tarum through mutual friends, and they started making music together.",
      "Hauldren and Carberry live in Chicago, and Hauldren worked on much of \u201cFront to Back\u201d at their place in Bucktown \u2014 not far from Wrigley Field.",
      "\u201cMy window is the skyline of Chicago and stuff,\u201d Hauldren said. \u201cAnd so seeing that song get played at Wrigley Field when it was made watching the skyline of Chicago and being very close to Wrigley Field was just insane to me.\u201d",
      "After Crow-Armstrong used the song as his walkup music, Hauldren posted on Instagram about how much it meant to him. He tagged Crow-Armstrong in the post, and the two talked. They are hoping to meet up at some point.",
      "Levity played Coachella this year, and it is going to Lollapalooza this summer in Chicago's Grant Park. But Hauldren said his connection with Crow-Armstrong ranks right up there when it comes to his most memorable experiences with his group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that if someone ever plays a walkout song for us, that it was the Cubs,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t be happier that, you know, of all the teams that it was my team.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- NBC is continuing its strategy of infusing the Olympics with pop culture and celebrity appeal to generate momentum ahead of the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in Italy next year.",
      "This time, Italian American comedians Ray Romano and Sebastian Maniscalco will make their debut during a comical promotion, the network said on Wednesday. The commercial will air during NBC\u2019s Kentucky Derby coverage on Saturday.",
      "In the spot, Romano and Maniscalco stand atop the Italian Alps with snowboards in hand, attempting to discuss thrilling winter sports like skiing, snowboarding and luge. But their discussion is repeatedly sidetracked by their shared obsession with Italian food.",
      "\u201cRay and I teamed up for the Olympics, two Italian guys trying to figure out winter sports,\u201d Maniscalco said in a statement. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, we thought \u2018luge\u2019 was a type of pasta.\u201d",
      "Romano and Maniscalco filmed the commercial in Los Angeles, with the mountaintop backdrop brought to life by Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company founded by George Lucas and recently known for its work on \u201cThe Mandalorian.\u201d",
      "The network said Romano and Maniscalco were an easy choice to start building anticipation for the Winter Games.",
      "\u201cBoth are instantly recognizable, deeply beloved, and naturally funny,\u201d said Joseph Lee, senior vice president of creative marketing, sports and entertainment at NBC. He said the network is using the same playbook of enlisting entertainers and athletes.",
      "Last year, popular figures who appeared in promo spots included Snoop Dogg, Megan Thee Stallion, Simone Biles, Peyton Manning, Cardi B, SZA and Lily Collins.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running the same playbook across the campaign: pairing entertainment personalities with the Olympics (and often Olympians) in fun, unexpected ways,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we\u2019ll continue to keep the Games culturally relevant \u2014 and genuinely entertaining.\u201d",

      "Black style will have its moment as the biggest night in fashion gets underway",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fashion icons like Dapper Dan, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and the late Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style \u2014 bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes \u2014 but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism.",
      "The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute spring exhibit, \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, Monday's Met Gala.",
      "Inspired by Monica Miller\u2019s book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme.",
      "Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England's Beau Brummell, dandyism has been recontextualized over the years to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression.",
      "This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery \u2014 uniforms for slaves and servants \u2014 that signaled their owners' wealth.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,\u201d said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit.",
      "Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes.",
      "\u201cThis is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,\u201d Miller explains in her book.",
      "Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays.",
      "Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for the Harlem Renaissance.",
      "Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York's Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs.",
      "The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem's Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,\u201d she said.",
      "The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes.",
      "\u201cMany of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it\u2019s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,\u201d said Tara Donaldson, co-author of \u201cBlack In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans\u2019 economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes.",
      "\u201cThat kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, \u2018No, no you can\u2019t have that,\u2019\u201d Steele said.",
      "One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a provocation,\u201d Square said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, \u2018You don\u2019t have access to this.\u2019\u201d",
      "The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria.",
      "Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion's gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress.",
      "Singer and actor Mon\u00e1e, who sits on this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2019s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Mon\u00e1e's distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style.",
      "As Mon\u00e1e and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous \u201cTailored for You\u201d looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before.",
      "\u201cBlack people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,\u201d said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. \u201cIt is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.\u201d",

      "In a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d T",
      "NEW YORK -- One of the toughest things about appearing on Broadway might not be the acting or the hours. It's squeezing your resume to under 100 words for your bio in Playbill. T.R. Knight tried to include all of it, initially.",
      "\u201cI was getting angry at myself for getting precious about what to include and what not to include,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, 'You are being ridiculous.'\u201d",
      "So instead of trying to fit in a career that has spanned Shakespeare and \u201cGrey's Anatomy,\u201d a David Mamet play and \u201c The Flight Attendant, \u201d Knight changed direction.",
      "\u201cThere once was an actor named Knight,\u201d his Playbill blurb now reads. \u201cWho knew his stage-left from stage-right/He went to do some TV/But now he's happy to be/Back in front of the glowing footlights.\u201d",
      "What has lured him back on Broadway is the jaw-dropping prequel to the Netflix hit show \u201cStranger Things,\u201d a play with levitating cats, shattered mirrors and Vegas showgirls.",
      "Set in Hawkins, Indiana, 20 years before the events of the first season, \u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d focuses on the creation of a monster, the villainous Vecna, played by \u2014 Louis McCartney. Knight portrays his father.",
      "We are introduced to a shy, awkward teen Henry Creel \u2014 who later will be Vecna \u2014 as he moves to Hawkins and goes to high school. He has strange powers and worries a lot.",
      "His father is not in a great place, suffering from PTSD and drinking too much. \u201cI think he desperately wants to be a good husband and a good father, and I think he knows that he is failing at both,\u201d says Knight. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the tools to stop it.\u201d",
      "Knight was a \u201cStranger Things\u201d fan even before he joined the play, looking forward to every season. He was asked to audition for a different character but was drawn to the father after reading the script.",
      "\u201cAlthough our damage is different, I felt that I understood that damage in a way that I did not understand this other character,\u201d he says. \u201cI just felt it strong enough in my gut that it felt like it could be a better match.\u201d",
      "\u201cStranger Things: The First Shadow\u201d co-director Justin Martin says Knight is constantly changing his approach and always surprising, calling him a \u201cRenaissance man in terms of his acting\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about the work. He\u2019s very much interested in very, very different characters and different styles of acting. And so he constantly is pushing himself. Every time he does the scene it\u2019s slightly different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s going, \u2018What else can I find? What else could I mine?\u2019 which I love in an actor.\u201d",
      "The \u201cStranger Things\u201d play was also attractive to Knight because of its director: Stephen Daldry, the three-time Tony Award-winner who helmed \u201cBilly Elliot: The Musical.\u201d",
      "Knight recalls being blown away by the way Daldry told the story without sentimentality of an 11-year-old boy who just wants to dance.",
      "\u201cThe way he was able to distill that down in such a brutally beautiful, honest way left me \u2014 when I left that theater \u2014 I remember being both empty and filled up at the same time if that\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "Knight and his husband have moved back to the New York area after years in Los Angeles, wanting to do more theater, something he calls \u201chome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still so challenging, still immensely challenging, maddeningly challenging to me \u2014 theater \u2014 but I love it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just missed it.\u201d",
      "Knight grew up in Minneapolis and spent two years at the city\u2019s storied Guthrie Theater before moving to New York at 25. He became a household name in the hit ABC medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d which he left after five seasons.",
      "He feels like a new chapter is opening, one with confidence and maturity. The move coincides with a change in his creative work and life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time and maybe it\u2019s a time where I can let go of a lot of the nonsense that I have maybe worried about \u2014 maybe? Do you like the way I said, maybe worried about in the past? The nonsense has kind of plagued me.\u201d",

      "In 2019, David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman",
      "In true Clark Kent form, the new Superman would like to correct the record.",
      "David Corenswet gave an interview to Entertainment Weekly in 2019 where he said his \u201cpie in the sky ambition\u201d was to play Superman.",
      "At that point, the role was not on the market. And Corenswet, a Julliard graduate and Philadelphia native, was just making a name for himself in the industry, with plum breakout roles in two Ryan Murphy Netflix series: \u201cThe Politician\u201d and \u201cHollywood.\u201d Tall, dark, and you know, handsome, people had told him that he looked like Superman for a long time. He did not, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview, think that he was going to get the chance to play him.",
      "But a few years later he was actually cast to lead James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d which will begin a new, hopefully high-flying, era for the DC universe of films when it hits theaters on July 11. And that once innocent quote took on a life of its own. Many headlines and stories misinterpreted the phrase and wrote that he said it was his dream role, as though he'd manifested it into existence.",
      "\u201cI said it was my pie in the sky ambition, which I meant to mean that there was no (expletive) way it was ever going to happen,\u201d Corenswet, 31, said. \u201cI sort of was thinking of it as, \u2018Oh, who wouldn\u2019t love to get to play an iconic role like that? Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing and impossible if we lived in a universe where that could even be considered?\u2019\u201d",
      "Right around the time when Gunn was starting to think about casting his new Superman movie, he decided to watch his friend Ti West\u2019s movie \u201cPearl.\u201d In that darkly comedic horror, Corenswet stood out to him as an interesting and charismatic presence. He played a projectionist at a local movie theater who catches Pearl\u2019s attention (and, later, faces her wrath). West had nice things to say about him too.",
      "\u201cDavid was one of the very first auditions that I got,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cInstantly, it was a relief because he had a playful charm about him that was not evident in \u2018Pearl.' He had a sense of humor. That made me go, \u2018Ooh, this might be a really good match.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was just the beginning of the long casting process. Even Nicholas Hoult, who was ultimately cast as Lex Luthor, was up for the part. And though it was \u201cextensive,\u201d Corenswet said it was one of the most \u201csatisfying audition processes\u201d he\u2019s ever gone through \u2014 not because he booked the role, but because he felt he got the opportunity to show them what he had to offer.",
      "Gunn laughed that Corenswet actually has a lot of Superman in him.",
      "\u201cSuperman is a square and David is a square,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cHe listens to American Songbook. Like Dean Martin and Cole Porter. That\u2019s what he listens to on his iPad. That\u2019s weird. But oh, so Superman.\u201d",
      "When Gunn called him with the good news, the first person he told was his wife. The second was his sister, who couldn\u2019t pick up the phone because she was on a golf course.",
      "\u201cShe texted, \u2018Is it possible that was a phone call with super good news?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes. Super good news.\u2019\u201d",
      "It may be something of a Superman tradition to try on your predecessor\u2019s costume during a screen test. Henry Cavill did it with Christopher Reeve\u2019s, and Corenswet did it with Cavill\u2019s, which he called a \u201cmarvel of engineering.\u201d",
      "But the first time Corenswet put on his own Superman costume was not some magical, transportive moment. In fact, he said, it was \u201cwonderfully mundane.\u201d The suit was still in its beginning stages, not totally put together and even a little small, as he\u2019d already started putting on weight for the role.",
      "\u201cI remember the feeling of kind of growing into the suit and the suit growing around me fitting by fitting,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cWe had such an amazing costume team and they built the suit around me over the course of many weeks and months and it started to feel just a little bit like home for me.\u201d",
      "The first time he felt the impact of it was through the eyes of other people. To him, it was old hat, but when he walked onto set the first time in the suit he noticed something different from the cast and crew.",
      "\u201cI saw their faces sort of light up and I went, \u2018Wait a minute, these people aren\u2019t that fond of me,\u2019\u201d he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s when it hits you.\u201d",
      "There are almost three roles involved in playing Superman. There\u2019s the person he is with his parents and the people he grew up with. There\u2019s Clark Kent of the Daily Planet. And then there\u2019s Superman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a public facing character, he\u2019s a symbol,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cThere\u2019s a presentational element to it, because he does want to present an image of calm and authority. While he doesn\u2019t always feel that way, he always wants to make other people feel that way as Superman.\u201d",
      "To prepare for Clark Kent, Corenswet looked at the All-Star Superman comic and how Christopher Reeve changed his posture when Lois left the room, but he also drew inspiration for the voice and demeanor way outside of the canon: His brother-in-law, who is 6\u20198\u201d and 270 pounds, but is the \u201cquietest, most wonderful man.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I sort of took the spirit of Clark,\u201d Corenswet said. \u201cHe\u2019s this big presence, but he\u2019s desperately trying to be as small as possible and as quiet as possible.\u201d",
      "Gunn has promised that the film is \u201ca personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new.\u201d He\u2019s a character who is \u201cpretty damn good, but flawed.\u201d And anyone who has seen the trailer knows there will be romance with Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane \u2014 but there\u2019s even a different spin on that.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in love with her,\u201d Gunn said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that needs the convincing in the relationship. It\u2019s not him. You really see where he needs her in his life.\u201d",
      "Corenswet said that in addition to the action and thrills, the movie also has a Preston Sturges quality to it with \u201clonging romance and witty comedy.\u201d Fitting for their reporter characters, \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d was also a big reference with \u201cthe rhythm, the patter and the feeling of two people in love who really are an equal match for the other.\u201d",
      "The movie is the start of a new era for DC films, and will raise Corenswet\u2019s profile immeasurably. He\u2019s been in big movies before, including \u201cTwisters.\u201d But being Superman is different.",
      "\u201cThe thing that it changed about my life immediately was that I had this amazing mission that I got to go on of playing the part and getting to be a piece of making this awesome film,\u201d he said. \"I have so many new friends now. James brings together such a familial cast and crew. And shooting the film is sort of like an extended summer camp.\u201d",
      "Adding to the summer camp vibes: On the last day they even gathered to watch a little blooper reel that Gunn had put together. But what will happen come release is not really something he can fathom at this point.",
      "\u201cI expect some things will change when the film comes out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, one still has to wake up and eat breakfast.\u201d",

Now a new Apple TV+ period drama, \u201cCar\u00eame,\u201d argues that he was the very first celebrity chef. There's even a \u201cTop Chef\u201d style cooking contest in front of a panel of judges.",

      "The series, which drops its first two episodes Wednesday, also shows how Car\u00eame wasn\u2019t just a cook, or master pastry maker, or, well, sex god. We watch as he's pulled into political intrigue by his boss, the cunning diplomat Talleyrand, and used as a spy.",

He is absolutely Car\u00eame in real life \u2014 very attractive for everyone, a young man who is maybe sometimes a bit insouciant, or careless. \u201c",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, the show plays up the sex factor. The first scene sets the tone with Car\u00eame and his lover, Henriette, in a food-tasting session that morphs immediately into sex, but then duty calls: Napoleon\u2019s soldiers are coming for dinner.",
      "Bourboulon says that first scene was very intentional, establishing in a few minutes the three main themes of the series: food, sex and politics. Did we mention sex?",
      "Of course, he wasn\u2019t an accomplished chef, so Voisin was given intensive lessons.",
      "\u201cI spent two months in the kitchen to learn the customs of the great French tradition,\u201d the actor says. He focused on learning how to realistically convey what Car\u00eame did best: invent dishes of wild whimsy, especially flamboyant dessert creations like a huge pyramid, or the \u201ccroquembouche\u201d tower \u2014 a cascade of cream puffs. Car\u00eame is also known for inventing the vol-au-vent, an airy French pastry shell.",
      "But even so, this master pastry maker can't even chop an onion correctly when he arrives for work at his first big kitchen job. The job of teaching him falls to the talented sous-chef in Talleyrand's kitchen, Agathe (Alice Da Luz).",
      "Da Luz trained alongside Voisin on the kitchen brigade at the Ferrandi culinary school in Paris \u2014 and vastly improved her skill set. \u201cWe really learned the choreography of a kitchen, we really learned technique,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd today I can boast that I cut onions at a crazy speed.\u201d",
      "The actors had a dream workspace: The production spent six weeks building a huge, airy kitchen where they work for Talleyrand \u2014 unlike the cramped, smoky kitchens that would be more historically accurate.",
      "Viewers may feel the need to brush up on their history. The show takes place shortly after Napoleon seized political power in 1799 and became first consul, on his way to later declaring himself emperor.",
      "The actors had to brush up, too.",
      "Voisin says he knew about \u201cthe victories and defeats of Bonaparte,\u201d but had to learn from scratch the story of Car\u00eame.",
      "Lyna Khoudri, who plays mysterious Henriette \u2014 who may or may not be on her lover\u2019s side \u2014 notes: \u201cWe\u2019re making a series about the heritage of French culinary art, a story I didn\u2019t know. I found out why we\u2019re so famous for our cuisine in France.\u201d",
      "Da Luz had studied the period at school but dove into it more deeply once she was cast. There was not a lot to read about Agathe, but she read everything she could find. And then, she says, \u201cI let my imagination go,\u201d inspired to bring a woman out of the shadows of history.",
      "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier, who plays Talleyrand (actual name Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord), also engaged in extensive research. \u201cIt\u2019s a character who has led a thousand lives,\u201d he said, \u201cwho lived through almost a century of history, at a time when people were guillotined for not much. So ... he must have been very clever.\u201d",
      "The show, for Renier, is in large part about ambition. \u201cAll these characters have a goal, a dream to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe question is, what are we ready to win or lose to achieve this dream?\u201d",
      "The production is lush throughout the whole season, beginning with the gorgeous country homes \u2014 filmmakers scouted 60 of them, and chose 12. They created new dinner services to dress the tables, and made 3,000 candles to light all the candelabras \u2014 different hues for different rooms. There were 96 vases of fresh flowers at all times in Talleyrand\u2019s home, according to production notes.",
      "As for costumes, some 1,000 of them were made from scratch, because the filmmakers had a specific vision of clothing that was not period-accurate but also not completely modern.",
      "Then there was that crazy banquet that ends the season. Filming at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, which boasts dramatic fountains, the production created a giant tent covered with \u201can extraordinary amount of velvet,\u201d and loaded down the tables with food, including a 60 kilo (132 pound) leg of lamb and a 50 kilo (110-pound) tuna.",
      "They also made 5,000 cream puffs, which were assembled into grand, towering structures \u2014 befitting not only a new emperor but the world\u2019s first celebrity chef.",

      "Tardy photographers",
      "NEW YORK -- Like all brides, Elana Goldin had high hopes for her wedding photos and video.",
      "\u201cI loved their images,\u201d she said of the company picked by her dad and future mother-in-law. \u201cThey were award-winning. They were in a ton of magazines. I really liked the vibe of the owner.\u201d",
      "The feeling didn't last.",
      "The photographer, who showed up 45 minutes late with a team of two, wasn't the owner, as the company had promised. She was someone Goldin had never spoken to. The fill-in had a bad attitude from the start, said Goldin, who lives in Chicago and got married last May in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.",
      "Among other things, the photographer criticized Goldin's bridal shoes, jewelry and perfume as second rate for traditional close-up shots, and she picked apart the bouquets without permission to get images before the ceremony.",
      "\u201cShe and the florist got into a fight. There was friction from the moment she walked in,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "Looking back, Goldin said she would have done a few things differently.",
      "We asked wedding planners and photographers to also weigh in on how they think photo disaster can be averted.",
      "Goldin wishes she had been more assertive. She had provided a shotlist ahead of time, but the photographer assigned to the bride and bridesmaids started making demands on where she wanted Goldin to pose.",
      "\u201cI'm in my dress and she said let\u2019s take a picture in the shower, because it was a very big, glamorous shower. My sister was like, absolutely not. Not happening,\u201d Goldin recalled.",
      "At the venue, the photographer insisted on taking photos outside. The weather was rainy and windy, and the lighting was dreary.",
      "\u201cIt was disgusting outside. My dress got all dirty at the bottom. My hair starts frizzing. The bridesmaids came out and our hair was blowing everywhere. The pictures were awful,\u201d Goldin said.",
      "You love them dearly. But New Jersey-based wedding planner Danielle Rothweiler of Rothweiler Event Design advises against it.",
      "\u201cI always tell my couples, stop hiring your friends and family because if something goes wrong, think of that conversation that you\u2019re going to have. No one wants that,\u201d she said.",
      "One client took up an uncle on his offer to shoot her wedding as his gift. He missed half the shots and didn't understand the importance of timing. He also spent a good amount of time just being a guest and not taking pictures at all.",
      "\u201cShe never said anything. The pictures weren't great,\u201d Rothweiler said. \u201cI have a wedding coming up this year and half the vendor list is friends and family and I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m so scared about it.\u201d",
      "Michelle Jackson, who owns the photo vendor Bambino International based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said some basic questions about equipment can go a long way.",
      "Make sure your photographers have back up camera bodies and other crucial equipment of the same quality as their primary gear, she said. Cameras with dual slots for SD cards or XQD cards are optimal.",
      "\u201cEverything's being copied onto two cards,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst disaster for a photographer is you have no pictures at all because of equipment failure. Couples don't think about that.\u201d",
      "In the same vein, San Francisco wedding photographer Oscar Urizar, the proprietor of Red Eye Collection in San Francisco, said couples should ensure they have the rights to personal use of their photos. That allows them to print, share and display them for non-commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cI started in the film industry. If you didn\u2019t get your negatives, you couldn\u2019t print your photos. It's kind of that same thinking,\u201d he said.",
      "There's nothing more chaotic than organizing group shots at weddings. The larger the wedding, the more chaotic it can be.",
      "Wedding planner Tirusha Dave, founder of the luxury market Bravura Brides, serves South Asian couples around the world with guest lists up to 300 or more.",
      "She puts together a shareable document and asks couples to list every person expected in each group shot, but she doesn't stop there. She has them designate one person to serve as wrangler. The wrangler must know every person in the group by sight so they can be chased down if necessary.",
      "\u201cI tell my couples, I\u2019m really great at what I do but I don't know your second cousins, your extended aunts and uncles,\u201d Dave said.",
      "Each group is assigned a number that's announced when it's time to gather.",
      "Dallas-area photographer April Pinto, founder and co-owner of April Pinto Photography, has a stable of shooters. They can juggle up to four weddings a week.",
      "They sink or swim by how well the timeline is observed. Not an easy task, Pinto said, \u201cwhen you have a coordinator timing you and the mother of the groom who wasn\u2019t on the Zoom call making her own agenda and stressing out the bride. We're in the middle of all of that.\u201d",
      "But that's just part of the challenge. The other part?",
      "The rowdy bridesmaid, Pinto said. She's somebody who might have had a bit too much Champagne and feels like she should be in charge.",
      "\u201cIf a bridesmaid is feeling a little too spicy, we try to give her tasks,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cI find that keeping people in general engaged and involved can go a long way. You can turn all that stress into a happy time.\u201d",

      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",

It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",

      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",

      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky is reporting a 30.2% drop in drug overdose deaths in 2024",
      "The number of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year dropped by 30.2% \u2014 down to 1,410 lives lost \u2014 giving state leaders a surge of confidence that prevention and treatment efforts are making progress against an addiction epidemic they say is shattering families across the state.",
      "This was the third straight yearly decrease in drug overdose deaths for the state, although prior declines were substantially smaller. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers, and fatal overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who announced the latest overdose statistics on Thursday, called the results a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reflecting years of painstaking work to combat the spread and use of drugs.",
      "\u201cThis is what we have been hoping for and praying for,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here ought to give everyone who\u2019s worked so hard to get to this point ... hope that we can do even more.\"",
      "State Attorney General Russell Coleman, a Republican, said Kentuckians should \u201crejoice in every life saved from this scourge,\u201d but warned that powerful illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pose a threat.",
      "\"As little as one pill can and is killing our sons and daughters,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "Fentanyl and methamphetamine continued to be the most prevalent drugs contributing to overdose deaths in Kentucky.",
      "Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has steered huge sums of federal funding to his home state to combat its addiction woes, said he was encouraged by the gains in combating the drug crisis, from stemming the flow of illicit drugs to offering treatment services in communities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always worked to keep Kentucky at the forefront of our national response to the drug crisis,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \"We are finally making progress in restoring the Southern Border, but there\u2019s still a lot of work left to do in the commonwealth to help those struggling with addiction.\u201d",
      "Kentucky's drop reflected broader gains achieved in the U.S. There were about 97,000 U.S. overdose deaths in the 12 months that ended last June 30, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the prior 12-month period.",
      "Overdose death rates nationwide began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and more recently fentanyl.",
      "Beshear, seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, said plenty of groups were deserving of credit for Kentucky's big decline in overdose deaths. He praised law enforcement efforts to remove dangerous drugs from circulation and the work of addiction treatment centers and other recovery services. And he credited those Kentuckians battling addiction who reached out for help.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s your first, fifth or 10th attempt, we want to stand behind you,\" the governor said. \"We want to provide you the best help that we can.\u201d",
      "Other factors, he said, include the distribution of Narcan, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, as well as the availability of addiction services through Medicaid and the work of syringe exchange programs.",
      "\u201cRegardless of what the politics say, syringe exchange programs work,\" Beshear said. \"They help us get to know people and they help us to save lives.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Coleman has rolled out a youth-focused initiative aimed at keeping young people away from deadly substances.",
      "With all those efforts, the challenge now is to continue driving down fatal overdoses, Beshear said.",
      "\u201cIt ought to tell us that an epidemic that arose in our time, we should be able to defeat in our time,\u201d the governor said.",

      "Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro doctors say he has left intensive care but remains hospitalized after undergoing bowel surgery",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian ex-President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to recover after undergoing bowel surgery, has left intensive care, his doctors said Thursday.",
      "The medical team at the DF Star Hospital in Brasilia said that he left intensive care on Wednesday and there is no set discharge date from the facility. His health condition is stable and he has begun receiving a liquid diet.",
      "Bolsonaro underwent a 12-hour surgery on April 13 to remove intestinal adhesions and reconstruct the abdominal wall. It was the sixth procedure related to long-term effects of being stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in September 2018.",
      "He has been in and out of hospitals since the attack and underwent multiple surgeries during his presidency from 2019-2022.",
      "Doctors described the latest surgery as the \u201cmost complex\u201d since the stabbing, requiring a \u201cvery delicate and prolonged post-surgery.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was admitted with severe abdominal pain to a hospital in Santa Cruz, a small city in Rio Grande do Norte, on April 11 and then transferred to a hospital in the state\u2019s capital, Natal. His family later requested his transfer to Brasilia.",
      "He had been preparing for a trip across northeast Brazil to promote his Liberal Party\u2019s right-wing agenda, eyeing next year\u2019s presidential election, though he himself is barred from running. The region traditionally has been a political bastion of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court for allegedly attempting to stage a coup in January 2023, with riots led by his supporters in Brasilia.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is again trying to rehire some staffers who were recently fired amid mass layoffs at the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- For the second time in recent months, the Food and Drug Administration is bringing back some recently fired employees, including staffers who handle travel bookings for safety inspectors.",
      "More than 20 of the agency\u2019s roughly 60 travel staff will be reinstated, according to two FDA staffers notified of the plan this week, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "Food scientists who test samples for bacteria and study potentially harmful chemicals also have been told they will get their jobs back, but have yet to receive any official confirmation.",
      "The same uncertainty hangs over employees who process agency records for release to lawyers, companies and journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. About 100 of those staffers were recently eliminated, according to an agency official with direct knowledge of the situation.",
      "But in recent days the FDA has missed multiple court-ordered deadlines to produce documents, which could result in hefty fines. That's prompted plans to bring back a significant number of those staffers.",
      "The apparent reversals are the latest examples of the haphazard approach to agency cuts that have shrunk FDA\u2019s workforce by an estimated 20%, or about 3,500 jobs, in addition to an unspecified number of retirements, voluntary buyouts and resignations.",
      "In February, the FDA laid off about 700 provisional employees, including food and medical device reviewers, only to rehire many of them within days after pushback from industry, Congress and other parties.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services hasn't detailed exactly which positions or programs were cut in the mass layoffs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has repeatedly said that no FDA scientists were fired as part of the reductions. But at least two dozen food scientists who worked in a San Francisco testing laboratory and a Chicago research center were let go in March.",
      "An HHS spokesperson suggested the apparent mix-up was due to \u201cthe fractured, outdated HR infrastructure we inherited from the Biden administration and are now actively overhauling.\u201d The spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about which employees are being reinstated but said the administration will \u201cstreamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us.\u201d",
      "About 15 scientists working in FDA\u2019s Division of Food Processing Science and Technology in Chicago were told last week they be will reinstated, according to a staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But a week later there has been no written confirmation and the scientists have not returned to the office. The group\u2019s research includes studying ways to prevent harmful bacteria from growing on produce and preventing the spread of microplastics and other particles from food packaging.",
      "\u201cI hope Commissioner Makary continues to assess these ill-informed cuts and works to bring back impacted employees expeditiously,\u201d said Susan Mayne of Yale University, the FDA\u2019s former food director. \u201cHis legacy as commissioner is on the line.\u201d",
      "With more than 15,000 employees remaining across various U.S. and foreign offices, the FDA\u2019s core responsibilities are reviewing new drugs, medical products and food ingredients as well as inspecting thousands of factories.",
      "Makary has said no inspectors or medical reviewers were fired as part of the recent reductions. But current and former FDA officials note that those frontline employees are often supported by teams of administrative staff.",
      "FDA inspectors, for example, have long relied on travel bookers to coordinate trips to India and other countries that often involve visa permissions, security measures, ground transportation, tech support, translation services and other logistics. Inspectors can spend up to half the year traveling, a grueling workload that makes recruiting and retaining staff a challenge.",
      "For a brief period last month, inspectors were told they would be booking their own travel. The FDA set up a hotline to assist with making the arrangements. Then, agency leaders developed a plan to hire an outside contractor to perform the work.",
      "On Monday, staffers were informed that about a third of the fired staff who performed the work would be returning.",

      "NEW YORK -- More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to provisional data posted Wednesday.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That\u2019s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.",
      "The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.",
      "The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes.",
      "Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.",
      "But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, experts say. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.",
      "The U.S. has one of the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found wide racial disparities in such deaths, with Black women dying at a far higher rate than white women.",

      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",
      "About one-third of community water systems, serving more than 60% of the U.S. population, fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 analysis by the CDC.",

      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",
      "But, she said, \u201cI believe this is the beginning of a long battle to protect the voters\u2019 wishes from the wills and the whims of the businesspeople who don\u2019t want to pay sick days.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman in Kansas City, Missouri, has pleaded not guilty in the fatal stabbing of a paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance",
      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "Spoken-word poets in Cameroon are using their art form to help communities cope with traumas left by the ongoing civil war",
      "BUEA, Cameroon -- A woman cried out upon seeing what looked like a corpse, a sheet-covered form lying on a stretcher. As volunteers wheeled it onto the stage, Boris Taleabong Alemnge recited a poem whose title spoke the unspoken: \u201cDeath.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe day you die, people will cry,\u201d the 24-year-old told hundreds of audience members in an embattled part of southwest Cameroon. \u201cBut this won\u2019t stop the clock from ticking or the flowers from blooming.\u201d",
      "Alemnge is among a group of artists using spoken-word poetry to denounce ongoing bloodshed in Cameroon\u2019s English-speaking regions, where separatists are fighting government forces. The supposed corpse was a stage prop, but the tears and wails that greeted it were real.",
      "The civil war has killed an estimated 6,500 people, a majority of them civilians, and displaced nearly 1 million since 2016.",
      "Spoken word has gained new prominence in Cameroon as poets like Alemnge, who performs under the stage name \u201cPenboy,\u201d believe their art form taps into the everyday dangers of war zones that many people avoid talking about.",
      "\u201cDeath is inevitable, yet many people don\u2019t even want to think about it,\u201d he said after a performance he organized in March to launch his latest album, \u201cRED.\u201d",
      "Artists have found eager audiences who say they feel moved by the rhythms of the spoken word.",
      "\u201cI have watched crowds fall silent, then rise like waves, because his words have the power to heal,\u201d said Prosper Langmi Ngunu, who watched Penboy\u2019s performance.",
      "Almost everyone in Anglophone areas has lost someone close to them. Mental health issues are common. So, too, is gang rape by members of the warring parties, contributing to a rise in teenage pregnancy.",
      "\u201cRED\u201d returns to the themes of Penboy\u2019s first album, \u201cNatives of the Universe,\u201d which advocates that people share common humanity and fight for reasons of vanity that don\u2019t justify the human cost.",
      "Despite the linguistic divides deepened by the conflict, Penboy has toured six of Cameroon\u2019s eight Francophone regions to draw people\u2019s attention to atrocities committed in English-speaking regions. There, he said, his poems found empathetic audiences and even turned some listeners into advocates for peace.",
      "International and local organizations have documented looting, killing and torture as well as mass rape and the burning of villages. The warring sides often trade blame for such abuses.",
      "The scars of colonial rule shape discord in modern-day Cameroon along linguistic fault lines. Once a German colony, Cameroon was divided between Britain and France after World War I. They ruled it as two separate entities until the early 1960s, when Cameroon became independent and united as a single, federal, bilingual state.",
      "The arrangement was short-lived. The following decade, Cameroon passed a referendum amending its constitution and dissolving sections guaranteeing the rights of the English-speaking minority.",
      "The English-speaking population makes up about 20% of the country\u2019s roughly 30 million people. They feel marginalized by the Francophone majority. Tensions spiked in 2016 when the government attempted to impose French in English-speaking regions\u2019 schools and courts, igniting protests that security forces violently repressed.",
      "The clashes prompted some English-speaking separatists to take up arms against the government. Both sides have been accused of violence against civilians.",
      "The growing popularity of spoken-word events like Penboy\u2019s March 9 gathering reflects how people are becoming less afraid to express their outrage, said another spoken-word artist who goes by Camila.",
      "\u201cSince we cannot pick guns to fight, we use the power of the spoken word to send across our message. Some find peace in it, others find healing, while some get educated,\u201d she said.",
      "Her performance drew inspiration from an October 2021 attack in which a soldier killed 5-year-old schoolgirl Caro Louise Ndialle after shooting at a car fleeing a checkpoint.",
      "\u201cHow can we forget carrying the lifeless body of our baby girl in our hands with her open skull like a trophy won from a tournament?\u201d Camila asked the audience.",
      "Her poems tap into memories of bodies strewn on city streets, and schools and hospitals that stop operating after government soldiers and separatist fighters burn them to the ground.",
      "Other works lampoon what poets see as hypocrisy and nonchalance by the warring sides.",
      "In \u201cCries Of War,\u201d spoken-word poet and writer Sandra Nyangha tells the story of people fed up with the conflict and eager for a return to peace.",
      "\u201cIf you can give the order for something such as war to start, then you can also give the order to end it,\u201d she said.",
      "For Penboy, spoken-word gatherings are part of efforts to bring the arts to crisis-affected communities. He has also worked on initiatives like the Students In Activism Project, launched last year, to help youth build self-confidence through developing their writing and performances.",
      "The war has robbed many of an education, he said.",
      "\u201cMy goal here is not just to perfect their skills. It is for them to use the art forms to bring solutions to their communities,\u201d Penboy said. \u201cArtists have the responsibility to use their craft to advocate for change.\"",

      "The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "By midday Sunday, the livestream\u2019s remote cameras captured 70 moose swimming across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "The livestream will end at 10 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) Sunday. It kicked off April 15, a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement.",
      "Johan Erhag, SVT\u2019s project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d said this year's crew will have produced 478 hours of footage \u2014 \"which we are very satisfied with,\" he wrote in an email to The Associated Press Saturday evening.",

      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",

China\u2019s increased trade with Russia has helped the country mitigate some of the worst blows from the sanctions.",

      "As France prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nazi surrender to Allied forces, World War II survivors reflect on painful memories shaped by the German occupation of the country and the deportation of Jews and others to death camps",
      "PARIS -- As France prepares to mark the 80th anniversary of the Nazi surrender to Allied forces, survivors of World War II reflect on painful memories of fear, deprivation and persecution shaped by the German occupation of the country and the deportation of Jews and others to death camps.",
      "In May 1940, Nazi forces swept through France. Among those caught in the chaos was 15-year-old Genevi\u00e8ve Perrier, who fled her village in northeastern France to escape the advancing German troops like millions of others. By June, France had surrendered.",
      "Three years later, Esther Senot, 15, was arrested by French police and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In 1944, 19-year-old Ginette Kolinka was sent to the same death camp.",
      "Now close to 100 years old, the women continue to share their stories, determined to keep the memory of the war alive and pass its lessons on to future generations.",
      "\u201cWe were scared,\u201d Perrier remembered as she described fleeing on bicycle with her mother, carrying only a small travel bag, while her uncle took a horse-drawn cart on the roads of eastern France.",
      "\u201cThere were lots of people fleeing, with kids in baby carriages, everyone was running away. There was a column of civilians fleeing and a column of French soldiers fleeing,\" she said.",
      "Perrier and others hid in a field when they heard bomber planes. \u201cMom had a white hat. Some told her: \u2018remove your hat!\u2019 And that\u2019s when I saw a huge bomb pass over our heads. It didn\u2019t explode. It was the chance of a lifetime.\u201d",
      "Later taking a train, Perrier found refuge for a few months in a small town in southwestern France, in an area governed by the collaborationist Vichy regime, before her mother decided they would go back home \u2014 only to live under harsh Nazi occupation.",
      "\u201cThe Resistance was big in our area,\u201d Perrier said, adding she was willing to join the so-called French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Three women from the FFI were captured and tortured by the Nazis just a few kilometers away from her home, she recalled.",
      "\u201cMy mother kept telling me: \u2018No, I don\u2019t want you to leave. I don\u2019t have a husband any more, so if you go\u2026\u2019\" she said. \"She was right, because all three of them were killed.\u201d",
      "Still, Perrier kept her spirit of resistance in her daily life.",
      "\u201cAt church, there was a Catholic hymn,\u201d she said, singing: \u201cCatholic and French, always!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bellowed it with all our might, hoping they (the Nazi soldiers) would hear,\u201d she said.",
      "When the Allied forces landed on Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944, Perrier said she didn't have much access to news and could not believe it.",
      "Later that year, she saw the troops of General Leclerc\u2019s 2nd French Division, equipped with American tanks, coming into her village. \u201cThey liberated us and there was a tank that had stopped almost on our doorstep. So I went to see the tank, of course. And then, they held a ball not far away,\u201d she said.",
      "Towards the end of the war, French men brought a German soldier they accused of having killed a baby to the village's cemetery. \u201cThey made him dig his grave. They put him in it\u2026 They killed him,\" she said.",
      "Born in Poland from a Jewish family who emigrated to France at the end of the 1930s, Esther Senot was 15 when she was arrested in Paris by French police. She was deported in Sept. 1943 to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp by cattle train. At the ramp, the Nazis selected those they could use as forced laborers.",
      "\u201cA German with his loudspeaker said: the elderly, women, children, those who are tired can get on the trucks,\u201d she recalled. \"Out of the 1,000 people we were, 650 got on the trucks.... And 106 of us, women, were selected to go back to work in the camp to forced labor.\u201d Others were gassed to death soon after their arrival.",
      "Senot survived 17 months in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other camps and made it back to France at age 17.",
      "In spring 1945, the Lutetia hotel in Paris became a gathering place for those returning from the concentration camps. Senot described the crowd of people looking for missing family members, some bringing photos of their loved ones, while walls were covered with posters listing the names of survivors.",
      "\u201cIt was bureaucratic,\" Senot said. \u201cAt the first counter, they gave us temporary identity cards. Then they gave us a fairly basic medical examination ... And those who were lucky enough to find their family, they went to an office where they were given some money and were told: \u2018Now you\u2019ve completed the formalities... you go home.\u2019\u201d",
      "Seventeen members of Senot\u2019s family were killed by the Nazis during WWII, including her mother, her father and six siblings.",
      "In a recent commemoration in front of the hotel, Senot said she had hoped her survival would \"bear witness to the absolute crime in which we were caught.\u201d But once back in France, she felt the hardest thing was the indifference to the fate of those who had been deported.",
      "\u201cFrance had been liberated for one year and people didn\u2019t expect us to return with all the misery in the world on our shoulders,\" she said.",
      "In her former Parisian neighborhood, a small crowd watched her. \"I weighed 32 kilos (70 pounds) when I came back, my hair was shaved. One year after the Liberation, people hadn\u2019t meet any woman looking like that.\"",
      "Senot said when she started to explain what happened to her, \u201cyou could see the disbelief in their eyes.\u201d \"And suddenly they got angry. They said: 'But you have gone mad, you are talking nonsense, it couldn\u2019t have happened.\u2019 And I will always remember the face of a man who looked at me and said: \u2018You came back in such small numbers, what did you do to come back and not the others?\u2018\u201d",
      "Kolinka, who was 19 when she was deported in April 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, is well known in France for sharing her vivid memories of the concentration camps with the younger generation in the past two decades.",
      "In June 1945, when she returned to Paris, she weighed only 26 kilos (57 pounds) and was very weak. Still, compared to some others, she felt \u201clucky\u201d to find her mother and four sisters alive in France when coming back home. Her father, a brother and a sister died in death camps.",
      "She did not speak about the war for over half a century. \u201cThose who told their story, it\u2019s true that it seemed unbelievable (at the time),\u201d she said.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "In the 2000s, Kolinka joined an association of surviving deportees and began to speak out.",
      "\u201cWhat we have to keep in mind is that everything that happened was because one man (Adolf Hitler) hated the Jews,\" she said.",
      "\u201cHatred, for me, is dangerous,\u201d she added. \u201cAs soon as we say: that one is like this, that one is like that, it already proves that we make a difference when in reality, no matter whether we are Jews, Muslims, Christians, Blacks, we are human beings.\u201d",

      "TANGIER, Morocco -- More than a year of protests over Morocco\u2019s decision to normalize ties with Israel has emboldened activists and widened a gap between the decisions of the government and the sentiments of the governed. The fury has spilled into the country\u2019s strategic ports.",
      "Amid shipping cranes and stacked containers, 34-year-old agricultural engineer Ismail Lghazaoui marched recently through a sea of Palestinian flags and joined protesters carrying signs that read \u201cReject the ship,\u201d in reference to a vessel transporting fighter jet components from Houston, Texas.",
      "Activists are urging Moroccan port officials to try to block ships carrying military cargo to Israel, much like Spain did last year. Protests often target Danish shipping company Maersk, which helps transport components used to make Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 as part of the U.S. Defense Department's Security Cooperative Participant Program that facilitates weapons sales to allies including Israel.",
      "A similar boycott campaign landed Lghazaoui in prison last year, but that didn't deter him from turning out again for resurgent protests last month, after his release. Lghazaoui is one of more than a dozen activists pursued by Moroccan authorities for criticizing the government\u2019s ties with Israel.",
      "During a rally in November in Casablanca where Lghazaoui spoke, plainclothes officers beat him and others to prevent them from advancing toward the U.S. Consulate, he said. He later posted about Maersk on social media and was arrested and charged with incitement. He spent four months in prison, from November to February.",
      "\u201cThey try to silence people,\u201d Lghazaoui told The Associated Press. \u201cThey were using me to dissuade people or to push people away from what they were doing.\u201d",
      "Morocco is one of four Arab states that normalized ties with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords brokered in 2020 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The deal delivered something Moroccan diplomats had chased for years: U.S. support for Morocco\u2019s claims over the disputed Western Sahara. But its cost \u2014 growing public resentment toward normalization \u2014 has ballooned throughout the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen such a chasm between public opinion and the monarchy. What the power elites are doing goes completely against what the Moroccan people want,\u201d said Aboubakr Jamai, dean of the Madrid Center at the American College of the Mediterranean.",
      "Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of Morocco since the war began. While largely made up of families, students, Islamists, leftists and union members, the protests have also drawn more radical voices. Some have burned Israeli flags or chanted against royal adviser Andr\u00e9 Azoulay, a Jewish Moroccan.",
      "Clad in riot gear, security forces have stood by and watched as protesters denounce \u201cnormalization\u201d and Morocco\u2019s expanding trade and military ties with Israel.",
      "But authorities have shown that their tolerance for dissent only goes so far.",
      "Morocco\u2019s constitution generally allows for freedom of expression, although it is illegal to criticize the monarchy or King Mohammed VI and those who do can face prosecution. Throughout the war, activists who have implicated the monarchy on social media or protested businesses targeted by boycotts due to their operations in Israel have received prison sentences.",
      "The constraints mirror Egypt and Jordan, which like Morocco have publicly sympathized with the Palestinians, maintained ties with Israel and imprisoned activists who direct their ire toward the government.",
      "However, unlike in those countries, the arrests in Morocco have done little to quell public anger or activists\u2019 demands.",
      "In recent weeks, protesters have set their sights on a new target: the country\u2019s strategic ports and the companies using them to move military cargo. Activists and port workers recently demanded that two vessels crossing the Atlantic carrying fighter jet parts that they suspected would end up in Israel be blocked from docking in Morocco.",
      "Port protests gained momentum last month when Morocco\u2019s largest labor union backed the call to block the two ships, and dozens of religious scholars and preachers, many affiliated with the anti-monarchy Islamist movement Al Adl wal Ihsan, issued an edict with a similar message.",
      "While not officially allowed to participate in politics, Al Adl wal Ihsan has mobilized large crowds and helped lead pro-Palestinian activism throughout the Israel-Hamas war, drawing in young people who feel official parties don\u2019t speak to them. On a recent Friday, the group said Moroccans took part in 110 demonstrations across 66 cities in support of Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Both Al Adl wal Ihsan and union members marched portside in Tangier and Casablanca, where the vessels eventually docked April 20.",
      "In a statement, Maersk acknowledged that ships that passed through the two Moroccan ports carried parts used in the fighter jet. But it denied activists\u2019 claims of directly shipping weapons to conflict zones, stating that they require end-use certificates to verify the final destination of military cargo.",
      "A port official in Tangier who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter said that while cargo docked and unloaded in Morocco undergoes examination, ships docking en route to other destinations do not.",
      "The Israeli military did not respond to questions about the shipments. F-35s are typically assembled in the United States, using components sourced throughout the world, including outer wings and display systems manufactured in Israel.",
      "Morocco\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions about normalization or its port policies, though diplomats have previously argued that relations with Israel allow them to press for a two-state solution and facilitate aid delivery to Gaza.",
      "Some observers in Morocco have questioned whether the focus on Gaza has diverted attention from pressing domestic struggles. Voices from Moroccan nationalist circles on social media have instead highlighted the marginalization of the Indigenous Amazigh population and the dispute over Western Sahara, which they argue are more central to national identity and sovereignty.",
      "For others, the prolonged war has prompted clear shifts. The Islamist Justice and Development Party, which once backed normalization with Israel while in power, recently invited senior Hamas officials to its congress in Rabat. However, the officials were unable to obtain visas to enter Morocco.",

      "It was the mounting rage of citizens in Viterbo, a small town north of Rome, that ended the longest papal election in the Catholic Church\u2019s history, forging for the first time the word \u201cconclave.\u201d",
      "VITERBO, Italy -- It was the mounting rage of citizens in Viterbo, a small town north of Rome, that put an end to the longest papal election in the history of the Catholic Church, forging for the first time the word \u201cconclave.\u201d",
      "The Viterbo conclave in the 13th century was a pivotal event in papal elections, lasting almost three years \u2013 exactly 1,006 days \u2013 due to deep divisions among the cardinals over the name of the new pope.",
      "Viterbo is also considered the birthplace of modern conclaves, where cardinals are confined to a single place until they elect a new pontiff, and often need to negotiate before reaching a compromise on the final name.",
      "In November 1268, the cardinals -- summoned in Viterbo to elect the successor of the late Pope Clement IV -- were split mainly between two factions and couldn\u2019t reach a consensus before September 1271.",
      "As the cardinals continued to deliberate in Viterbo, frustration rose among locals due to the lack of progress, as political and internal struggles had cast a shadow over the election.",
      "Those divisions stemmed from the cardinals\u2019 allegiance to competing parties, mainly supporters of the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. That was further complicated by personal and family ties, making any agreement on the pope's election extremely difficult.",
      "The electing marathon led citizens ,who at the time had to pay for the cardinals\u2019 room and board expenses, to resort to drastic measures.",
      "The cardinals were first locked in Viterbo\u2019s papal palace with a key, giving birth to the term conclave, which comes from the Latin words \u201ccum\u201d (with) and \u201cclavem\u201d (key).",
      "\u201cThe cardinals left us a very important testimony, a parchment, dated June 8, 1270, where they said to be locked inside a palazzo discoperto, a palace with no roof,\u201d said Elena Cangiano, an archaeologist at Viterbo\u2019s medieval Palazzo dei Papi (Palace of the Popes).",
      "Cangiano noted that, according to Viterbo oral tradition, the cardinals ended up camping inside the unroofed palace.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s reportedly testified by some holes found on the hall\u2019s floor, which could be those left by the tents\u2019 poles,\u201d she explained.",
      "Then Viterbese also restricted the cardinals\u2019 meals to bread and water to make them hurry up. As that didn\u2019t work either, they started tearing off part of the roof of the large room that hosted the college of cardinals, exposing them to the elements.",
      "Those extreme conditions only lasted three weeks, following which the cardinals were allowed access to the other rooms of the palace, but not to leave the building. It would take another 15 months before Gregory X was chosen as the new pope.",
      "That was the longest papal election ever: To avoid the same situation ever occurring again, Gregory X promulgated a new apostolic constitution \u2014 called \u201cUbi Periculum\u201d \u2014 that imposed strict regulations on the election and allowed to isolate the cardinals.",
      "Gregory\u2019s election was also seen as a \u201ccompromise,\u201d with his name chosen to unite the divided college of cardinals and bring an end to the exhausting process.",
      "That\u2019s why the Viterbo conclave is seen by historians as setting the stage for future papal elections. The rules and practices established at the time laid the foundation for many of the procedures used currently in papal conclaves.",
      "Among the new rules, Gregorio X decreed that cardinals were restricted to \u201cone meal per day,\u201d and later, to bread, water and wine, to further encourage a quick decision. The newly elected Adrian V, however, suspended those rules a few years later.",
      "Fabrizio Cardoni, 61, born and raised in Viterbo, considers the city\u2019s primacy a matter of pride.",
      "\u201dThis is the history of our city,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we care a lot about our medieval neighborhood, we care about the pope palace that is truly wonderful and, let\u2019s say, almost unique.\u201d",
      "Cristina Giusio, a tourist visiting from northern Italy, was struck by the history of the Viterbo conclave after a tour of the papal palace. \u201cIt was something quite amazing. ... I did not know that first conclave started here, so it was a real surprise,\u201d she said.",
      "Vatican history experts stress that modern conclaves still owe to Viterbo some of their key characteristics, including shorter durations.",
      "Viterbo's legacy could again play a role again in the conclave that starts on Wednesday in Rome\u2019s Sistine Chapel to choose Pope Francis\u2019 successor.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say that the timing is now almost certainly respected, also thanks to all that happened in Viterbo,\u201d said Cangiano. \u201cIn recent times, usually, it doesn\u2019t take that long to elect the pope.\u201d",

      "VATICAN CITY -- While Pope Franci s accomplished a lot in his 12-year papacy, he left much unfinished business and many challenges for his successor \u2014 from the Vatican's disastrous finances to the wars raging on multiple continents and discontent among traditionalists about his crackdown on the old Latin Mass.",
      "When the conclave's cardinals finish casting their ballots under Michelangelo's frescoed ceilings of the Sistine Chapel, the 267th pope will have to decide whether to continue Francis\u2019 policies, tweak them, or abandon them altogether. Will he prioritize migrants, the environment and the social justice policies that Francis championed, or give precedence to other issues?",
      "Among the challenges facing the new pope:",
      "Francis did more to promote women to leadership positions in the Vatican than any pope before him, and his successor will have to decide whether to continue that legacy, accelerate it or back down and change course.",
      "The issue isn't minor. Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools and hospitals and are usually responsible for passing the faith to the next generation. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men.",
      "Some are voting with their feet.",
      "Nuns are leaving in droves, either through attrition or simply quitting, leading to questions about the future of female religious orders.",
      "The Vatican says the number of nuns globally has been hemorrhaging about 10,000 per year for over a decade, with their numbers at 599,229 at the end of 2022, the last year for which there are statistics. In 2012, there were 702,529 nuns globally.",
      "The new pope will have to address women's expectations for not only a greater say in church governance, but greater recognition.",
      "\u201cWe are the great majority of the people of God,\u201d said Maria Lia Zerbino, an Argentine named by Francis to advise the Vatican on bishop nominations, a first for a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of justice. It\u2019s not an achievement of feminism, it\u2019s in the church\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "Women\u2019s Ordination Conference, which advocates for female priests, goes further. \u201cThe exclusion of women from the conclave, and from ordained ministry, is a sin and a scandal,\u201d it said.",
      "Gervase Ndyanabo, a prominent lay leader in Uganda, said there should be more participation of the laity and women in the administration of parishes and decision-making at all levels. Progress, he said, has come \u201cat a snail\u2019s speed.\u201d",
      "An anonymous letter circulated among Vatican officials in 2022, highlighting what it called Francis\u2019 \u201cdisastrous\u201d pontificate and what a new pope must do correct the \u201ccatastrophe\u201d he had wrought. Its author was Australian Cardinal George Pell, but that fact emerged only after his death in 2023. Once a close adviser to Francis but always conservative, Pell grew increasingly disillusioned with his papacy, signing the letter with the pen name, \u201cDemos\u201d \u2014 the common people.",
      "Last year, a screed by another anonymous cardinal circulated, signed by \u201cDemos II.\u201d It resumed where Pell left off, denouncing what it called Francis' \u201cautocratic, at times seemingly vindictive style of governance; a carelessness in matters of law; an intolerance for even respectful disagreement; and \u2013 most seriously \u2013 a pattern of ambiguity in matters of faith and morals causing confusion among the faithful.\u201d",
      "It blamed polarization in the church on the confusion Francis had sown and urged the next pope to focus on \u201crecovery and reestablishment of truths that have been slowly obscured or lost among many Christians.\u201d",
      "Those letters underscored the age-old divisions between traditionalists and progressives in the Catholic Church that were exacerbated during Francis\u2019 pontificate. He emphasized inclusion and \u201csynodality,\" or listening to the faithful, and cracked down on traditionalists by restricting their celebration of the old Latin Mass. While the conservatives may not have enough votes to elect one of their own, a new pope will have to try to restore unity.",
      "The polarization is keenly felt in the United States, where anyone using social media can challenge the Vatican or even the local church\u2019s perspective, said professor Steven Millies of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.",
      "Such forms of communications \"can have a narrative of what Catholicism is that doesn\u2019t come from any ordained minister, from any bishop, and can, night after night, the world over, suggest that the pope is wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "While many church leaders would like to think clergy sexual abuse scandals are in the past, survivors and their advocates want the new pope to address it as a top priority.",
      "Francis and Pope Benedict XVI took steps to end decades of abuse and cover-ups, changing church laws to punish abusers and their clerical superiors who hid their wrongdoing.",
      "But a culture of impunity still reigns, and church authorities have barely begun to deal with other forms of spiritual and psychological abuse that have traumatized generations of faithful. Twenty years after the sex abuse scandal first erupted in the U.S., there is still no transparency from the Vatican about the depth of the problem or how cases have been handled.",
      "The new pope must deal with not only the existing caseload but continued outrage from rank-and-file Catholics and ongoing revelations in parts of the world where the scandal hasn\u2019t yet emerged.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, groups of survivors and their advocates held news conferences in Rome to publicize the problem. They created online databases to call out cardinals who botched cases and demanded the Vatican finally adopt a zero-tolerance policy to bar any abuser from priestly ministry.",
      "Peter Isely of the U.S. group SNAP said it was \u201ccrazy and bizarre\u201d that the church doesn\u2019t apply the same rigor to abusers that it does to establishing criteria for ordination.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be a married man and a priest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a woman and a priest. \u2026 But you can be a child molester and a priest.\u201d",
      "Francis famously said, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d when asked in 2013 about a purportedly gay monsignor at the Vatican. Francis sought to assure gay people that God loves them as they are, that \u201cbeing homosexual is not a crime,\u201d and that everyone is welcome in the church.",
      "His successor must decide whether to follow in that outreach or pull back. There's plenty of support for rolling it back. In 2024, African bishops issued a continent-wide dissent from Francis\u2019 decision allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, and bishops from around the world attending his synod on the church's future backed off language explicitly accepting LGBTQ+ people.",
      "\u201cWe want a united Catholic Church, but we must stay with the fundamentals,\u201d said Ndyanabo, the Ugandan lay leader. \u201cThe gospel should not change at all because of our own human weakness.\u201d",
      "The Rev. James Martin, who seeks to build bridges with LGBTQ+ Catholics, knows the degree of opposition but remains hopeful.",
      "\u201cThe challenge for the new pope is to continue Francis\u2019 legacy of reaching out to a group who has felt excluded from their own church,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBased on the synod, I would say that many cardinals feel that there needs to be welcome of LGBTQ+ people because they know their dioceses. But how far that goes is up in the air.\u201d",

Howard\u2019s departure coincided with the start of an extraordinary period of political instability that created a revolving door for political leaders. There have been six prime ministers since Howard, including one who served in the role twice in separate stints three years apart.",

      "She says Trump proposed sending troops to help Mexico fight drug trafficking.",
      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed sending American troops into Mexico to help her administration fight drug trafficking but that she rejected it.",
      "Her remarks to supporters in eastern Mexico came in response to a Wall Street Journal article published the day before, describing a tense phone call last month in which Trump reportedly pressured her to accept a bigger role for the U.S. military in combating drug cartels in Mexico.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you.\u2019 And you know what I said to him? \u2018No, President Trump.'\"",
      "She added: \u201cSovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sheinbaum's remarks.",
      "The U.S. military presence has increased steadily along its southern border with Mexico in recent months, following Trump\u2019s order in January to increase the army's role in stemming the flow of migrants.",
      "The U.S. Northern Command has surged troops and equipment to the border, increased manned surveillance flights to monitor fentanyl trafficking along the border and sought expanded authority for U.S. Special Forces to work closely with Mexican forces conducting operations against cartels.",
      "Trump designated many of the gangs and cartels smuggling drugs into the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations on Feb. 19, restricting their movements and lending law enforcement more resources to act against them.",
      "But Sheinbaum\u2019s hardline stance Saturday signaled that U.S. pressure for unilateral military intervention would put her and Trump on a collision course after months of cooperation on immigration and trade.",
      "\u201cWe can work together, but you in your territory and us in ours,\u201d Sheinbaum said.",
      "To a burst of applause, she added: \u201cWe will never accept the presence of the United States military in our territory.\"",

      "It was after their tiny plane crashed into the Bolivian jungle earlier this week that their problems really began",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- It was after their tiny plane crashed into the Bolivian jungle earlier this week that their ordeal really began.",
      "After smashing into the ground, the aircraft flipped over into a lagoon infested with anacondas and alligators, plunging the pilot and four passengers \u2014 including a 6-year-old boy \u2014 into a harrowing 36 hours spent clinging to the plane\u2019s wreckage before being rescued Friday in the northeast of this Andean nation.",
      "The doctor who treated the five survivors told The Associated Press on Saturday all were conscious and in stable condition, with only the young boy's 37-year-old aunt still hospitalized for an infected gash to her head. The rest were discharged and recovering from dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises and insect bites all over their bodies.",
      "\u201cWe couldn't believe it, that they weren't attacked and left for dead,\u201d Dr. Luis Soruco, director of the hospital where the survivors were delivered in Bolivia\u2019s tropical Beni province, said by phone after sending the pilot and two of the women home with a strong course of antibiotics.",
      "The pilot, 27-year-old Pablo Andr\u00e9s Velarde, emerged Friday to tell the story that has transfixed many Bolivians \u2014 a rare piece of uplifting news for a nation badly in need of it after years of a spiraling economic and political crisis.",
      "\u201cThe mosquitoes wouldn\u2019t let us sleep,\" Velarde told reporters from his hospital cot in the provincial capital of Trinidad, where Dr. Soruco said he was in surprisingly good health and spirits. \u201cThe alligators and snakes watched us all night, but they didn't come close.\u201d",
      "Shocked that the caimans (pronounced KAY-men), a species of the alligator family native to Central and South America, didn\u2019t lunge at them, Velarde speculated it was the stench of jet fuel spilling from the wreckage that had kept the predatory reptiles at bay, although there's no scientific proof that's an effective alligator repellent.",
      "Velarde said that the five of them survived by eating ground cassava flour that one of the women had brought as a snack. They had nothing to drink \u2014 the lagoon water was filled with gasoline.",
      "The small plane had set off Wednesday from the Bolivian village of Baures, bound for the bigger town of Trinidad farther south, where Patricia Coria Guary had a medical check-up scheduled for her 6-year-old nephew at the pediatric hospital, Dr. Soruco said. Two other women, neighbors from Baures ages 32 and 54, joined them.",
      "Such flights are a common form of transportation in this remote Amazonian region carved with rivers. Heavy rains wash away unpaved roads this time of year.",
      "But just 27 minutes \u2014 almost halfway \u2014 into the flight, the plane's lone engine cut out. Velarde said he reported their imminent crash over a portable radio to a colleague.",
      "He recalled in interviews with local media that he scanned the vast emerald green canopy below him and aimed for a clearing near a lagoon.",
      "\u201cThere was no ranch or road along the route,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just swamp.\u201d",
      "Instead of skidding across the shore as planned, the plane smashed into the ground and flipped upside down \u2014 injuring everyone on board and leaving Coria Guary with an especially deep cut to her forehead \u2014 before splashing into the water.",
      "\u201cThe landing was very rough,\u201d Velarde said.",
      "As the plane flooded, the five of them managed to clamber on top of the fuselage, where they stayed for two terrifying nights surrounded by caimans and anacondas and attacked by swarms of mosquitoes and other insects.",
      "They waved shirts and sheets to no avail and screamed each time they heard the thud of propellers or revving of a boat engine. On Friday, at the sound of approaching motorboats, \u201cwe started shining our cell phone flashlights and shouting,\u201d Velarde said.",
      "A group of fishermen noticed, and helped them into their canoe. They called the authorities and delivered them to an army helicopter some hours later.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have handled it one more night,\" Velarde said.",

      "Cardinal \u00c1lvaro Ramazzini is taking to his first conclave the same spirit that guided his decades-long front-line ministry among the migrants, poor and Indigenous people in Guatemala\u2019s highlands",
      "ROME -- Cardinal \u00c1lvaro Ramazzini is taking the same spirit to his first conclave that's guided his decades-long front-line ministry among the migrants, poor and Indigenous people in Guatemala\u2019s highlands \u2014 ensuring that the Gospel isn\u2019t preached \u201cin the abstract.\u201d",
      "Advocating for migrants was a priority of Pope Francis, who made Ramazzini a cardinal in 2019. Being elevated to the top hierarchy of the Catholic Church didn\u2019t faze the bishop of Huehuetenango, whose continued commitment to social justice led to many threats of violence. His native Guatemala is struggling through political turmoil and remains a hot spot of migration to the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a duty of conscience for the cardinals, now that we have the responsibility to name a new pope, that we don\u2019t lose sight that we\u2019ve been coming along a path and this path needs to continue to grow and grow and grow,\u201d Ramazzini told The Associated Press on Saturday, four days before Catholic cardinals gather to elect Francis\u2019 successor. \u201cI\u2019m talking about supporting, welcoming, and protecting the rights of migrants.\u201d",
      "Ramazzini said the church has to advocate for migrants forced by dire poverty to migrate along cartel-controlled routes where they\u2019re often extorted or trafficked, both by helping them with shelters and other humanitarian aid and by lobbying for comprehensive immigration reform.",
      "\u201cBut this we haven't achieved,\u201d Ramazzini said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t achieve it with Clinton, we didn\u2019t achieve with Obama, we didn\u2019t achieve it with Biden, and far, far less will we succeed with Mr. Trump.\u201d",
      "Still, the church shouldn\u2019t abandon migrants or the \u201cpastoral line\u201d of advocating for social justice, peace and fairer economic relations between countries that started gaining prominence with the Second Vatican Council and reached new heights under Francis, Ramazzini said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a line of continuity and I am sure that this will be a task for the next pope,\u201d the cardinal said in the hilltop headquarters of the Scalabrinians, a missionary order founded by an Italian bishop in the late 19th century to serve migrants and refugees. \u201cWe need to be the voice of all these people who don\u2019t have access oftentimes to lobbies that we can reach.\"",
      "For most of the 50-plus years since his ordination, Ramazzini has been bishop in San Marcos and then Huehuetenango, mountainous regions that were particularly hard-hit during Guatemala\u2019s civil war, which ended in 1996. Today, they continue to struggle with extreme poverty and drug-trafficking, pushing hundreds of thousands of local youths to migrate to the United States.",
      "Cardinals are sworn to secrecy about the ongoing deliberations regarding the direction of the church as they prepare to enter the conclave on Wednesday. But Ramazzini said he\u2019s heartened by the \u201cglobal vision\u201d shared by the unusually large number of cardinals electors \u2014 133, all but a couple of whom are already in Rome.",
      "He added that he trusts the next pope will pick up the pending task of reforming church institutions and its financial structure that Francis began, as well as continue the \u201cgreat sign\u201d of including more women in positions of leadership.",
      "Ramazzini also highlighted that spirituality and social justice action must go hand-in-hand.",
      "\u201cThis is the true spirituality, which is fed by prayer, by reflection on the word of God, but that has to be projected toward the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next pope will have his own spirituality. But the important thing is that nobody forgets that you can\u2019t have real spirituality without putting the Gospel concretely into practice.\u201d",
      "And his own beliefs are keeping him from being nervous about participating for the first time in the election of the next leader of the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not worried because I know that nothing will happen that our Lord Jesus Christ won\u2019t permit,\u201d Ramazzini said. \u201cIn the end, he\u2019s the master of the church, we are his servants. \u2026 So he will help us come out of this well.\u201d",
      "That's reassuring \u2014 as is the certainty that he won\u2019t be picked, Ramazzini joked.",

      "In a long and at times emotional talk, the 40-year-old prince said he wants reconciliation, while re-airing grievances against the royal family, the U.K. government and the media.",
      "Here are key takeaways from Friday\u2019s BBC interview:",
      "Harry said his father, King Charles III, won\u2019t speak to him because of \u201cthis security stuff\u201d \u2013 a legal wrangle over protection for the prince when he is in Britain.",
      "\u201cThis, at the heart of it, is a family dispute,\u201d he said.",
      "Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife Meghan quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to the United States, alleging hostility and racist attitudes by the press and royal establishment. Harry\u2019s tell-all 2023 memoir \u201cSpare,\u201d stuffed with private details and embarrassing revelations, made things worse.",
      "But Harry said what\u2019s souring the relationship now is a decision to remove his police protection detail after he stopped being a working royal. On Friday the Court of Appeal in London rejected Harry\u2019s bid to restore the protection, saying a government committee was justified in deciding that security arrangements should be decided on a case-by-case basis whenever Harry visits the U.K.",
      "Harry blamed the palace, alleging that the decision to withdraw his security had been made at the direction of royal officials, who sit on the committee alongside representatives from the police and government. He said they were \u201cknowingly putting me and my family in harm\u2019s way,\u201d hoping that the sense of threat \u201cwould force us to come back.\u201d",
      "He suggested his father was part of the problem, saying he\u2019d asked the king \u201cto step out of the way and let the experts do their job.\u201d",
      "King Charles, 76, has been treated for an undisclosed cancer for more than a year. Buckingham Palace has given infrequent updates, and has not disclosed what form of cancer the king has.",
      "Harry, who has met his father only once, briefly, since his diagnosis early last year, said \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d",
      "He held out little hope of another meeting soon.",
      "\u201cThe only time I come back to the U.K., is, sadly, for funerals or court cases,\u201d he said.",
      "After taking several months off last year, Charles has returned to a full slate of public duties. This week he told a reception for cancer charities that being diagnosed was \u201ca daunting and at times frightening experience.\u201d He added: \u201cI can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\u201d",
      "Harry has well-founded concerns for the safety of himself and his family.",
      "He is fifth in line to the throne, behind his brother William and William\u2019s three children. He spent 10 years in the British army, serving two tours of duty in Afghanistan in the war against the Taliban. Harry\u2019s lawyer said in court papers that al-Qaida had published a document that said Harry\u2019s assassination would please Muslims.",
      "Harry said that before 2020 he was placed in the highest tier of risk for royals, alongside his late grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "Since then, he has been stripped of government-funded police protection, and also denied permission to pay for it himself, leaving private security his only option \u2013 something he says leaves him at risk.",
      "\u201cWhether I have an official role or not is irrelevant to the threat risk,\u201d Harry said.",
      "He claimed that \u201csome people want history to repeat itself,\u201d an apparent reference to the death of his mother Princess Diana. She was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.",
      "Harry, Meghan and their children Archie, 5, and 3-year-old Lilibet, currently live in California, and Harry said he \u201ccan\u2019t see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the U.K.\u201d",
      "The prince said he loves Britain and \u201cit\u2019s really quite sad that I won\u2019t be able to show my children my homeland.\u201d",
      "Harry claimed that he and his family are endangered when visiting Britain because of hostility aimed at him and Meghan on social media and through relentless hounding by news media.",
      "Harry\u2019s explosive memoir \u201cSpare\u201d scattered bitterness and blame at Charles, Queen Camilla \u2013 Harry\u2019s stepmother \u2013 and his elder brother William.",
      "In the interview, he said he could forgive his family, and even the British press that he reviles and has repeatedly sued, for their role in events of recent years.",
      "\u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d Harry said.",
      "Historian Anthony Seldon said Harry had chosen his words deliberately to signal he \u201cwants to make a new start.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom this point on, from this speech, there will not be a significant turn back again. There will be no more spiteful books,\u201d Seldon told Sky News. \u201cHe has signaled he wants to be back in a way that needs to be worked out.\u201d",

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany's foreign ministry hit back at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio after he criticized the decision to classify the Alternative for Germany party as a \u201cright-wing extremist\u201d organization.",
      "The spat deepened Friday to embroil the foreign office, Rubio, U.S. Vice President JD Vance and tech billionaire Elon Musk. It also occurred at a complicated time for Germany \u2014 just days before the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and Nazi Germany\u2019s unconditional capitulation.",

      "The German domestic intelligence service's move to classify the AfD, which placed second in national elections in February, as a right-wing extremist group means its officials can now use informants and other tools such as audio and video recordings to monitor its activities nationwide.",
      "But it also risks fueling the party\u2019s claims of political persecution. Far-right parties have been gaining ground across Europe and the AfD attracts international attention, including support from Musk, who is a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla on Friday condemned the move as \u201ca severe blow to German democracy,\u201d given that the party has grown into one of the country\u2019s most popular political forces. They alleged that it was politically motivated, a claim the government denies.",
      "\u201cThe AfD will continue to legally defend itself against these democracy-endangering defamations,\u201d they said.",
      "AfD\u2019s second-place finish during the elections cemented the party\u2019s status as a factor that other politicians can\u2019t ignore, but the so-called \u201cfirewall,\u201d which mainstream German political parties have against working with far-right parties, has held.",
      "In his post on Friday, Rubio called on Germany to undo the classification.",
      "\u201cGermany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition. That\u2019s not democracy \u2014 it\u2019s tyranny in disguise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat is truly extremist is not the popular AfD \u2014 which took second in the recent election \u2014 but rather the establishment\u2019s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes. Germany should reverse course.\u201d",

We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt \u2014 not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.\u201d",

      "Musk has supported the AfD for months, including a chat with Weidel that he livestreamed on X earlier this year to amplify the party\u2019s message. Musk told Weidel that he was \u201cstrongly recommending that people vote for AfD.\"",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- When Warren Buffett announced at his annual shareholder meeting Saturday that he is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, he elevated a low-key 62-year-old Canadian executive named Greg Abel who has long been one of his top lieutenants.",
      "For the past seven years, Abel has been overseeing Berkshire\u2019s BNSF railroad and its treat makers See\u2019s Candies and Dairy Queen along with dozens of other manufacturing and retail businesses that Buffett acquired over the years.",
      "He grew up in Canada as a hockey player and learned the value of hard work as he redeemed discarded bottles and worked for a small company filling fire extinguishers. Now he finds himself at the top of the food chain in the investment world.",
      "Berkshire confirmed Abel as Buffett\u2019s successor in 2021 after former Vice Chairman Charlie Munger let it slip at the annual meeting. Since then, Abel has largely remained in Buffett\u2019s shadow although shareholders have had a chance to get to know him a bit when he appeared alongside Buffett at the annual meetings and in interviews.",
      "Berkshire's board will now vote on whether to formally approve Abel as the new CEO to take over at the end of 2025. At the annual meeting in Omaha, Buffett said he expects that to occur by a unanimous vote.",
      "Abel will step forward to take responsibility for all of Berkshire\u2019s eclectic assortment of businesses with their nearly 400,000 employees and the conglomerate\u2019s massive stock portfolio. Buffett and members of Berkshire\u2019s board who for years have devoted much of their time to finding Buffett\u2019s successor have praised Abel\u2019s brilliance and knack for understanding all kinds of businesses.",
      "Buffett once said Berkshire is \u201cso damn lucky\u201d to have Abel ready to take over, but he will have trouble coming close to Buffett\u2019s remarkable track record of outpacing the market. Whereas Buffett grew Berkshire over the decades by making well-timed deals and stock investments at attractive prices, Berkshire\u2019s massive size has made it that much harder lately to find anything big enough to change the conglomerate\u2019s bottom line.",
      "Abel has big shoes to fill, but no one expects him to match the accomplishments of Buffett that made him a billionaire many times over and one of the wealthiest investors of the past century. Longtime Berkshire board member Ron Olson said two days before the announcement that he believed Abel was ready to take over.",
      "\u201cIs he another Warren Buffett? No, there is no other Warren Buffett that I know. But he has so many of the fundamentals of Warren,\u201d Olson said. \u201cHe is for sure high integrity. He is a hard worker. He is a strategic thinker.\"",
      "Buffett has said for years that Abel\u2019s main job when he becomes CEO will be to preserve Berkshire\u2019s unique decentralized culture built on independence, integrity and trust. In fact, Munger\u2019s comment that gave away Abel\u2019s future role was that \u201cGreg will keep the culture.\u201d",
      "Executives at a diverse mix of Berkshire subsidiaries, including sneaker maker Brooks Running, flooring giant Shaw and Borsheims jewelry have said they all turn to Abel whenever they face tough questions in their businesses related to strategy or operating details, and he\u2019s always available when they need him though he will challenge them.",
      "\u201cWhen I think about Greg, he not only has high business acumen, but he has really high business instincts,\u201d Dairy Queen CEO Troy Bader said Friday. \u201cThe intuition is really important. And, you know, Warren has that intuition, but Greg has a lot of it as well.\"",
      "Abel has never done many interviews, though he put his detailed business knowledge on display at the Berkshire meetings when discussing utilities and the railroad. But he did offer a glimpse into his background to the Horatio Alger Association when that group honored him in 2018.",
      "Abel's family-oriented upbringing in Edmonton, Alberta, and lessons in hard work and perseverance were similar to what Buffett learned while working in his grandfather\u2019s Omaha grocery store as a kid.",
      "\u201cI think hard work leads to good outcomes. In my schooling, in sports, and in my business positions, I learned that if I put in a lot of work and was well-prepared, then success would be more likely,\u201d Abel said in 2018.",
      "Abel lives about two hours from Buffett\u2019s hometown in Des Moines, Iowa, where he has led Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2011 and helped coach his kids\u2019 hockey and soccer teams. He is expected to continue living there because Berkshire is so decentralized that there is little reason to move to its Omaha headquarters. Buffett only had a couple dozen people working in his office as he spent his days reading business reports and making the occasional phone call.",

      "Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport face long delays, cancellations.",
      "NEW YORK -- Passengers with flights to or from Newark Liberty International Airport encountered long delays and cancellations Saturday due to an air traffic controller shortage, a nationwide problem the Trump administration has pledged to fix.",
      "The busy airport outside New York City experienced disruptions all week. Faulting the Federal Aviation Administration's alleged failure to address \u201clong-simmering\u201d challenges related to the air-traffic control system, United Airlines cut 35 daily flights from its Newark schedule starting Saturday.",
      "United CEO Scott Kirby said the technology used to manage planes at the New Jersey airport failed more than once in recent days. The flight delays, cancellations and diversions the equipment problems caused were compounded when more than one-fifth of Newark's traffic controllers \u201cwalked off the job,\u201d he said.",
      "\"This particular air traffic control facility has been chronically understaffed for years and without these controllers, it\u2019s now clear \u2014 and the FAA tells us \u2014 that Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,\" Kirby wrote in a letter to customers.",
      "Airport status reports from the FAA data said staffing issues were causing average delays of nearly two hours for some arriving flights at Newark, and average delays of 45 minutes for departures.",
      "Two days earlier, Newark Liberty International Airport pointed to both staffing issues and \u201cconstruction\u201d when warning travelers about delays.",
      "The Trump administration says it\u2019s been trying to \u201csupercharge\u201d  the air traffic controller workforce and make moves to address the nation's shortage of controllers. The U.S. transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, on Thursday announced a program to recruit new controllers and give existing ones incentives not to retire.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a workers\u2019 union, said at the time that those moves could help address staffing shortages, but it also said the system is \u201c long overdue for technology and infrastructure upgrades.\u201d",
      "Duffy said on Friday that he visited with \u201cour hard working air traffic controllers as we work to fix these equipment outages caused by outdated technology.\u201d",
      "United's decision to pare back its flight schedule in Newark come at an already uncertain time for U.S. airlines. Potential customers across the industry are reconsidering whether to fly for work or for vacation given all the unknowns about what President Donald Trump's trade war will do to the economy.",
      "Uncertainty is so high that United recently made the unusual move to offer two separate forecasts for how it could perform financially this year: one if there were a recession, and one if not.",
      "From Newark, United flies to 76 U.S. cities and 81 international destinations.",

(AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett shocked an arena full of shareholders Saturday by announcing that he will retire at the end of the year, bringing the curtain down on a six-decade run leading Berkshire Hathaway that made him the most influential investor in the world.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s board on Sunday that Vice Chairman Greg Abel should replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,\u201d Buffett said.",
      "Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed that he would not take over until after Buffett's death. Previously the 94-year-old Buffett always said he had no plans to retire.",
      "Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question and answer period without taking any questions about it. He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.",
      "Abel returned an hour later without Buffett to conduct the company's formal business meeting, and he responded to the news.",
      "\u201cI just want to say I couldn\u2019t be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\u201d Abel said.",
      "Many investors have said they believe Abel will do a good job running Berkshire, but it remains to be seen how good he will be at investing Berkshire's cash. Buffett endorsed him Saturday by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.",
      "\u201cI have no intention \u2014 zero \u2014 of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg\u2019s management than mine.\u201d",
      "Thousands of investors in the Omaha arena gave Buffett a prolonged standing ovation after his announcement in recognition of his 60 years leading the company.",
      "During that period Berkshire nearly doubled the returns of the S&P 500, with a 19.9% compounded annual growth rate compared with the index\u2019s 10.4% gain.",
      "Buffett had such a devoted following among investors that markets would move when his investments were disclosed because so many people copied him.",
      "CFRA research analyst Cathy Seifert said it had to be hard for Buffett to decide to step down.",
      "\u201cThis was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,\u201d Seifert said. \u201cI think there will be an effort at maintaining a \u2018business as usual\u2019 environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.\u201d",
      "In many respects, Abel has already been running much of the company for years. But he hasn't been managing Berkshire's insurance operations or deciding where to invest all of its cash. He will now take those tasks on, but Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will remain to help oversee the insurance companies.",
      "Investment manager Omar Malik of Hosking Partners in London said before Buffett\u2019s announcement that he wasn\u2019t worried about Berkshire\u2019s future under Abel.",
      "\u201cNot really (worried). He\u2019s had such a long time alongside Warren and a chance to know the businesses,\u201d Malik said about Abel. \"The question is will he allocate capital as dynamically as Warren? And the answer is no. But I think he\u2019ll do a fine job with the support of the others.\u201d",
      "Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management said he wasn't surprised Buffett is stepping down after watching him Saturday because the 94-year-old wasn't as sharp as in past years. At one point, he made a basic math mistake in one of his answers. At other points, he got off track while telling stories about Berkshire and his investing without answering the question he was asked.",
      "Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.",
      "\u201cI think the challenge he\u2019s going to have is if anyone is going to give him Buffett or (former Vice Chairman Charlie) Munger\u2019s pass card? Not a chance in God\u2019s name,\" Smead said. Buffett always enjoyed a devoted following among shareholders.",
      "Buffett has said that Abel might even be a more hands-on manager than he is and get more out of Berkshire\u2019s companies. Managers within the company say they have to be well prepared before talking to Abel because they know he will ask tough questions.",
      "Steven Check, president of Check Capital Management, said he never thought he would see Buffett retire.",

      "Earlier Saturday, Buffett warned of dire global consequences from President Donald Trump's tariffs while telling the thousands of investors gathered at his annual meeting that \u201ctrade should not be a weapon\u201d but \"there's no question that trade can be an act of war.\u201d",
      "Buffett said Trump's trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don\u2019t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\u201d Buffett said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting.",
      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, so Berkshire is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \u201cbombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\u201d",
      "Buffett said the recent turmoil in the markets that generated headlines after Trump's tariff announcement last month \u201cis really nothing.\u201d He dismissed the recent drop as relatively small. He cited when the Dow Jones industrial average went from 240 on the day he was born in 1930 down to 41 during the Great Depression as a truly significant drop in the markets. Currently the Dow Jones Industrial Average sits at 41,317.43.",
      "\u201cThis has not been a dramatic bear market or anything of the sort,\" he said.",
      "Buffett said he hasn't bought back any of Berkshire's shares this year either because they don't seem to be a bargain either.",
      "Investor Chris Bloomstran, who is president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, told the Gabelli investment conference Friday that a financial crisis might be the best thing for Berkshire because it would create opportunities to invest at attractive prices.",
      "\u201cBerkshire needs a crisis. I mean Berkshire thrives in crisis,\u201d Bloomstran said.",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people every year who want to hear from Buffett, including some celebrities and well-known investors. This year, Hillary Rodham Clinton also attended. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly because he has shied away from politics and any controversial topic in recent years for fear of hurting Berkshire\u2019s businesses.",
      "One investor even camped outside the arena overnight to be first in line.",
      "Devan Bisher, 72, said he has faith in Berkshire's future and does not plan to sell the stock he started buying in the 1980s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a good train to ride,\u201d Bisher said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to stay with it.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs will indefinitely idle three steel plants this summer, saying Friday that it is being buffeted by sluggish demand and pricing for some products, including high carbon steel sheets.",
      "The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to \u201cinsufficient demand and pricing\u201d and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "\u201cThese temporary, indefinite idles are a necessary response to insufficient demand and pricing for the products the affected facilities produce, including rail, specialty plate, and high-carbon sheet; all of which fall outside of Cliffs\u2019 core business focus,\u201d the company said.",
      "The idlings will be indefinite, and start around June 30, at the end of a 60-day notice period required by federal law. About 950 workers will be out of work during the shutdowns, Cleveland Cliffs said.",
      "It said its flat-rolled steel production levels will not be affected.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs in recent weeks had announced that it will idle or partially idle two iron ore mines in Minnesota, affecting 630 workers. It also said in March that it will idle a steel plant in Dearborn, Michigan, affecting about 600 workers, citing \u201cweak automotive production in the United States.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Tesla sales plunged by more than half last month in several European countries in a sign that Elon Musk could struggle to revive the company after he shifts from his Washington work to running the automaker again.",
      "Tesla sales collapsed in April by more than two-thirds from a year earlier in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, according to auto groups and government agencies Friday. Sales at the Austin, Texas, company dropped by 59% in France and 38% in Norway.",
      "The countries are not major drivers of sales overall, but they are the first to report April results and thus a foretaste of possible trouble elsewhere as Tesla reels from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics.",
      "In Germany, where he told voters their country was lost if they didn't vote for a candidate widely derided for her extreme views, sales plunged 62% in the first three months this year. German sales for April are not out yet.",
      "Financial analysts covering Tesla are worried about the Musk backlash but caution it's not clear exactly how much to blame politics for the hit. Other factors suppressing sales include Tesla's aging model lineup and new offerings from rival electric vehicles makers, such as China BYD.",
      "Tesla also had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply. And the company is still waiting for European regulators to approve its partial self-driving features in its cars, a big selling point in the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cWe could see sales come back once they get it,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, though he added about the April figures, \u201cIt's never a good thing when you have large sales declines like this.\u201d",
      "The disappointing numbers come a little over a week since Musk told investors on a first-quarter conference call that he would be stepping back from his work in Washington as President Donald Trump's chain-saw wielding cost-cutting czar. Musk has shut down whole government departments as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and thrown tens of thousands of public workers out of their jobs.",
      "On the call, Musk said he would be spending only one or two days a week on DOGE work starting in May, acceding to demands that he refocus on his job as Tesla's chief executive officer.",
      "The stock has been rising since that announcement despite crumbling financial figures. Profits in the first quarter fell 71%.",
      "The sales hit in April was the worst in Sweden, where Mobility Sweden said they fell 81%. That was followed by a 74% plunge in the Netherlands and a 67% drop in Denmark, according to the Dutch trade association BOVAG and Mobility Denmark respectively.",
      "The Norwegian Road Traffic Information Council reported a 38% drop in that country.",

    "story": [
      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now",
      "Guacamole has been spared from tariffs for now. But salsa may not be so lucky.",
      "While threatened tariffs on Mexican avocados have been put on pause, the U.S. government plans to put a nearly 21% duty on fresh Mexican tomatoes starting July 14. A duty \u2014 like a tariff \u2014 is a tax on imports, and this one will impact the 4 billion pounds of tomatoes the U.S. imports from Mexico each year.",
      "Proponents say the duty will help rebuild the shrinking U.S. tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the U.S. is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70% of U.S. tomato market, up from 30% two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange, a trade group.",
      "\u201cUnless we even the playing field in terms of fair pricing, you\u2019re not going to have a domestic industry for fresh tomatoes in the very near future,\u201d said Robert Guenther, the executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange. Florida and California are the top U.S. producers of tomatoes, but most of California\u2019s crop is turned into sauces and other products.",
      "Opponents say the duty will make fresh tomatoes more expensive for U.S. buyers. NatureSweet, a San Antonio-based company that grows tomatoes in Mexico as well as the U.S., said it will be paying millions of dollars each month in duties if the decision isn\u2019t reversed.",
      "\u201cWe will look for ways to adapt or streamline our operations, but the truth is, we are always doing that so we run an efficient business already,\u201d said Skip Hulett, NatureSweet\u2019s chief legal officer. \u201cProduce is not a large-margin business. We\u2019re determining what portion of the cost we could absorb, but these added costs will most certainly need to be passed on to the consumer.\u201d",
      "Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, expects U.S. retail prices for tomatoes to rise by around 10.5% if the tariffs go through.",
      "Mexico\u2019s government said last month it was convinced it could negotiate over the issue. But if the duty goes into effect, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum hinted that Mexico could take similar action against imported chicken and pork legs from the U.S.",
      "The tug-of-war over tomatoes has a long history. In 1996, shortly after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, the U.S. Department of Commerce investigated allegations that Mexico was exporting tomatoes to the U.S. at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping.",
      "The U.S. government agreed to suspend the investigation if Mexico met certain rules, including selling its tomatoes at a minimum price. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides have always reached an agreement that avoided duties.",
      "But last month, the Commerce Department announced its withdrawal from the latest agreement, saying it has been \u201cflooded with comments\u201d from U.S. tomato growers who want better protection from Mexican imports.",
      "Guenther, of the Florida Tomato Exchange, said even though Mexican exporters are required to charge a minimum price, shipments are only spot-checked, so exporters can get around that. But more generally, Mexico hurts the U.S. industry because it costs 40% to 50% less to grow tomatoes there, Guenther said. Land is cheaper, labor is cheaper and inputs like seeds and fertilizer cost less, he said.",
      "Tomatoes are a labor-intensive crop, Guenther said, and the U.S. industry typically relies on immigrant workers through the H-2A visa program. That program required farmers to pay workers an average of $16.98 per hour last year, an amount that has jumped as labor has become harder to find. Richards estimates that workers on Mexican tomato farms earn about one-tenth that rate.",
      "NatureSweet acknowledges that it\u2019s more cost-effective to grow tomatoes in Mexico, but says climate is one of the biggest reasons. The company\u2019s Mexican greenhouses don\u2019t need lighting, heating or cooling systems because of the year-round weather conditions.",
      "\u201cYou can relocate some industries, but you can\u2019t relocate climate agriculture,\u201d Hulett said.",
      "Lance Jungmeyer, the president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes, said Florida doesn\u2019t produce the vine-ripened tomatoes that U.S. consumers increasingly favor. Florida tomatoes are picked when they\u2019re green and shipped to warehouses to ripen, he said.",
      "\u201cFlorida doesn\u2019t grow the kinds of specialty tomatoes that have taken off, but they want to get protection,\u201d Jungmeyer said. \u201cTheir market share is dropping for reasons of their own choice.\u201d",
      "Guenther disagrees. \u201cIf you put a Florida tomato up against a Mexican tomato, I think it would do very well in taste test,\u201d he said.",
      "Adrian Burciaga, co-owner of Don Artemio, an upscale Mexican restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, wouldn\u2019t want to switch to a U.S. producer. He compares it to fine wine; if he wants a good cabernet sauvignon, he gets it from Napa, California, but if he wants a good tomato that remind him of his childhood, he gets it from Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe know the flavors they are going to bring to the salsas and moles. We don\u2019t want to compromise flavors,\u201d Burciaga said.",
      "Burciaga said his restaurant uses 300 to 400 pounds of Roma tomatoes from Mexico every week. He currently pays $19 for a 25-pound crate of tomatoes. He doesn\u2019t relish paying the additional cost, but he feels he has no choice.",
      "Burciaga said the tomato duty and the threat of other tariffs against Mexico \u2013 which were put in place in February but then paused \u2013 are making it difficult to run his business.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty part concerns us. A small or medium restaurant budgets things out. We know in advance that in six months things will increase, so we\u2019re able to adjust,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know these things in advance.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to clear the way for Elon Musk \u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security systems containing personal data on millions of Americans.",
      "The emergency appeal is the first in a string of applications to the high court involving DOGE's swift-moving work across the federal government.",
      "It comes after a judge in Maryland restricted the team's access to Social Security under federal privacy laws. The agency holds personal records on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The government says the team needs access to target waste in the federal government. Musk, now preparing to step back from his work with DOGE, has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire entrepreneur has described it as a \u201c Ponzi scheme \u201d and insisted that reducing waste in the program is an important way to cut government spending.",
      "Solicitor General John Sauer argued Friday that the judge\u2019s restrictions disrupt DOGE\u2019s important work and inappropriately interfere with executive-branch decisions. \u201cLeft undisturbed, this preliminary injunction will only invite further judicial incursions into internal agency decision-making,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He asked the justices to block the order from U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "An appeals court previously refused to immediately to lift the block on DOGE access, though it split along ideological lines. Conservative judges in the minority said there\u2019s no evidence that the team has done any \u201ctargeted snooping\u201d or exposed personal information.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by a group of labor unions and retirees represented by the group Democracy Forward. The Supreme Court asked them for a response to the administration's appeal by May 12.",
      "More than two dozen lawsuits have been filed over DOGE's work, which has included deep cuts at federal agencies and large-scale layoffs.",
      "Hollander found that DOGE's efforts at Social Security amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "Her order does allow staffers to access data that has been made anonymous, but the Trump administration has said DOGE can't work effectively with those restrictions.",
      "Elizabeth Laird with the nonprofit group Center for Democracy and Technology said wide-ranging access to sensitive personal data poses a serious threat. \u201cIf DOGE gets a hold of this information, it opens the floodgates on a host of potential harms. It also normalizes a very dangerous practice for other federal agencies,\u201d she said.",
      "The nation's court system has been ground zero for pushback to President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping conservative agenda, with about 200 lawsuits filed challenging policies on everything from immigration to education to mass layoffs of federal workers.",
      "Among those that have reached the Supreme Court so far, the justices have handed down some largely procedural rulings siding with the administration but have rejected the government\u2019s broad arguments in other cases.",

    "story": [
      "The White House plans to unveil President Donald Trump\u2019s 2026 budget, his first since returning to power",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is planning on Friday to unveil President Donald Trump's 2026 budget, a sweeping framework that is expected to propose steep reductions, if not a wholesale zeroing out, of various federal programs as part of his administration's priorities.",
      "Budgets do not become law but serve as a touchstone for the upcoming fiscal year debates. Often considered a statement of values, this first budget since Trump's return to the White House carries the added weight of defining the Republican president's second-term pursuits, alongside his party in Congress.",
      "The White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025, confirmed Friday's planned release. It is expected to be the so-called \u201cskinny\u201d version of topline numbers, with more details to come.",
      "\u201cDetails soon,\u201d Vought said during a Cabinet meeting this week at the White House.",
      "The nation's estimated $7 trillion-plus federal budget has been growing steadily, with annual deficits fast approaching $2 trillion and the annual interest on the debt almost $1 trillion. That's thanks mostly to the spike in emergency COVID-19 pandemic spending, changes in the tax code and climbing costs of Medicare, Medicaid and other programs, largely to cover the nation's health needs as people age. The nation's debt load, at $36 trillion, is ballooning.",
      "This year's presidential budget request is expected to show deep reductions in spending, some reflective of the cuts already made by Trump's actions and adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, including the slashing of the government workforce. It also could point to potential new revenue streams, possibly from Trump's tariffs program.",
      "Democrats are prepared to lambast Trump's budget as further evidence that the Republican administration is intent on gutting government programs that Americans depend on.",
      "It comes as Congress is already deep into the slog of drafting of Trump's big bill of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered funds for the administration's mass deportation effort \u2014 a package that, unlike the budget, would actually carry the force of law.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who spoke with Trump multiple times this week, is racing to have the president's \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d approved by the House by Memorial Day and sent on to the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe had a very productive and encouraging meeting at the White House this morning, and the remaining pieces of \u2018The One, Big Beautiful Bill!\u2019 are coming together very well,\" Johnson, R-La., said in a statement after Thursday's meeting with Trump and various committee chairmen.",
      "But there remain deep differences among the Republicans, who are trying to pass that big bill over the objections of Democrats.",
      "\"We are awaiting some final calculations on a few of the tax components, and we expect to be able to complete that work on a very aggressive schedule,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Meantime, Cabinet officials are expected to start making the trek to Capitol Hill to testify about their various requests in the president's budget.",
      "It's Congress, under its constitutional powers, that decides the spending plans, approves the bills that authorize federal programs and funds them through the appropriations process. Often, that system breaks down, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap spending bills to keep the government funded and avoid federal shutdowns.",
      "Vought is also expected on Capitol Hill in the weeks ahead as the Trump administration presses its case to Congress for funds.",
      "Among the more skilled conservative budget hands in Washington, Vought has charted a career toward this moment. He served during the first Trump administration in the same role and, for Project 2025, wrote an extensive chapter about the remaking of the federal government.",
      "Vought has separately been preparing a $9 billion package that would gut current 2025 funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which involves Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to cease funding for PBS and NPR.",
      "Vought has said that package of so-called budget rescissions would be a first of potentially more, as the Trump administration tests the appetite in Congress for lawmakers to go on record and vote to roll back the money.",

    "story": [
      "European Union privacy watchdogs have fined TikTok 530 million euros",
      "LONDON -- European Union privacy watchdogs fined TikTok 530 million euros ($600 million) on Friday after a four-year investigation found that the video sharing app's data transfers to China breached the EU's strict data privacy rules.",
      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission also sanctioned TikTok for not being transparent with users about where their personal data was being sent and ordered the company to comply with the rules within six months.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok's lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company's European headquarters is based in Dublin.",
      "\u201cTikTok failed to verify, guarantee and demonstrate that the personal data of (European) users, remotely accessed by staff in China, was afforded a level of protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.",
      "TikTok said it disagreed with the decision and plans to appeal.",
      "The company said in a blog post that the decision focuses on a \u201cselect period\u201d ending in May 2023, before it embarked on a data localization project called Project Clover that involved building three data centers in Europe.",
      "\u201cThe facts are that Project Clover has some of the most stringent data protections anywhere in the industry, including unprecedented independent oversight by NCC Group, a leading European cybersecurity firm,\" said Christine Grahn, TikTok's European head of public policy and government relations. \u201cThe decision fails to fully consider these considerable data security measures.\u201d",
      "TikTok, whose parent company ByteDance is based in China, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal information of its users amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk over user data sent to China. In 2023, the watchdog fined the company hundreds of millions of euros in a separate child privacy investigation.",
      "The Irish watchdog said its investigation found that TikTok failed to address \u201cpotential access by Chinese authorities\u201d to European users' personal data under Chinese laws on anti-terrorism, counter-espionage, cybersecurity and national intelligence that were identified as \u2018materially diverging\u2019 from EU standards.\u201d",
      "Grahn said TikTok has \u201chas never received a request for European user data from the Chinese authorities, and has never provided European user data to them.\u201d",
      "Under the EU rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection.",
      "The investigation, which opened in September 2021, also found that TikTok's privacy policy at the time did not name third countries, including China, where user data was transferred. The watchdog said the policy, which has since been updated, failed to explain that data processing involved \u201cremote access to personal data stored in Singapore and the United States by personnel based in China.\u201d",
      "TikTok faces further scrutiny from the Irish regulator, which said that the company had provided inaccurate information to throughout the inquiry by saying that it didn't store European user data on Chinese servers. It wasn't until April that it informed the regulator that it discovered in February that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers.",
      "Doyle said that the watchdog is taking the recent developments \u201cvery seriously\" and \u201cconsidering what further regulatory action may be warranted.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s massive holdings of U.S. Treasurys can be \u201ca card on the table\u201d in negotiations over tariffs with the Trump administration, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said Friday.",
      "\u201cIt does exist as a card, but I think whether we choose to use it or not would be a separate decision,\u201d Kato said during a news show on national broadcaster TV Tokyo.",
      "Kato did not elaborate and he did not say Japan would step up sales of its holdings of U.S. government bonds as part of its talks over President Donald Trump's tariffs on exports from Japan.",
      "Earlier, Japanese officials including Kato had ruled out such an option.",
      "Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt, at $1.13 trillion as of late February. China, also at odds with the Trump administration over trade and tariffs, is the second largest foreign investor in Treasurys.",
      "Kato stressed that various factors would be on the negotiating table with Trump, implying that a promise not to sell Treasurys could help coax Washington into an agreement favorable for Japan.",
      "Trump has disrupted decades of American trade policies, including with key security allies like Japan, by i mposing big import taxes, or tariffs, on a wide range of products.",
      "A team of Japanese officials was in Washington this week for talks on the tariffs.",
      "The U.S. is due to soon begin imposing a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts, as well as an overall 10% baseline tariff. The bigger tariffs will hurt at a time when Japanese economic growth is weakening.",
      "Asian holdings of Treasurys have remained relatively steady in recent years, according to the most recent figures.",
      "But some analysts worry China or other governments could liquidate their U.S. Treasury holdings as trade tensions escalate.",
      "U.S. government bonds are traditionally viewed as a safe financial asset, and recent spikes in yields of those bonds have raised worries that they might be losing that status due to Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",

      "The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage has won a seat in Parliament and hundreds of council in local elections across England",
      "LONDON -- The hard-right party Reform UK led by Nigel Farage snatched a seat in Parliament from the governing Labour Party and won hundreds of local council seats from the opposition Conservatives in elections that Farage hailed Friday as a turning point towards ending the two parties' poltiical dominance.",
      "Reform's Sarah Pochin was declared winner of the seat of Runcorn and Helsby in northwest England by six votes after a recount, defeating Labour candidate Karen Shore by the narrowest of margins.",
      "It was a significant defeat for Labour, which easily won the district in last year's national election. The special election was held because Labour lawmaker Mike Amesbury was forced to quit after he was convicted of punching a constituent in a drunken rage.",
      "Farage said that \u201cit\u2019s a very, very big moment indeed\u201d that shows Reform can win against both Labour and the right-of-center opposition Conservatives.",
      "\u201cThis marks the end of two-party politics as we\u2019ve known it for over a century,\u201d he said.",
      "The Runcorn victory gives Reform, which garnered about 14% of the vote in last year\u2019s national election, five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, compared to 403 for Labour and 121 for the Conservatives.",
      "But Reform appears to have momentum. National polls now suggest its support equals or surpasses that of Labour and the Conservatives, and it hopes to displace the Conservatives as the country\u2019s main party on the right before the next national election, due by 2029.",
      "The local elections held Thursday in many areas of England were a sobering rebuff to Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour government, 10 months after it was elected in a landslide.",
      "Farage\u2019s party is targeting working-class voters who once backed Labour. Starmer\u2019s popularity has plunged as his government struggles to kick-start a sluggish economy. The government has raised the minimum wage, strengthened workers\u2019 rights and pumped money into the state-funded health system \u2014 but also hiked employer\u2019 taxes and cut welfare benefits.",
      "Starmer said that he understood why many voters are discontented.",
      "\u201cMy response is: We get it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am determined that we will go further and faster on the change that people want to see.\u201d",
      "The results were an even bigger blow to the Conservatives, whose voters switched to Reform in droves.",
      "Reform, which didn't exist when these areas last voted four years ago, won hundreds of municipal seats in the elections for six mayoralties and the control of 23 local councils, mostly at the Tories' expense.",
      "Reform won control of several county-level local authorities, including previous Conservative strongolds Staffordshire and Lincolnshire in central England, Durham in the north and Farage's home county of Kent in the southeast.",
      "Reform candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative lawmaker, won the newly created mayoralty of the Greater Lincolnshire region of east-central England. Labour retained three other mayoralties and the Conservatives won one.",
      "The victories will bring pressure for Reform to deliver on transport, garbage collection, potholes and all the other unglamorous demands of everyday politics.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who could now face a party revolt, posted on X that she was \u201cdetermined to win back the trust of the public and the seats we\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "The results give only a partial snapshot of voter sentiment. Many areas, including London, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, didn't hold elections. Turnout for local polls is typically much lower than in a national election.",
      "And Reform isn't the only story. The centrist Liberal Democrats made gains by winning more affluent, socially liberal voters away from the Conservatives.",
      "Reform UK is the latest in a series of parties led by Farage, a veteran hard-right politician who was crucial in taking Britain out of the European Union through a 2016 referendum. A charismatic campaigner, he is a divisive figure who has said that many migrants come to the U.K. from cultures \u201calien to ours.\u201d",
      "Reform blends Farage\u2019s long-standing political themes \u2014 strong borders, curbing immigration \u2014 with policies reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. During the campaign Farage said that he plans \u201ca DOGE for every county\u201d in England, inspired by Elon Musk\u2019s contentious spending-slashing agency.",
      "University of Strathclyde political scientist John Curtice said that the results showed that politics in Britain, long dominated by the two big parties, has fragmented.",
      "\u201cReform are now posing a big threat to both Conservative and Labour,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Wall Street extended its gains to a ninth straight day, marking its longest winning streak since 2004 and reclaiming the ground it lost since President Donald Trump escalated his trade war in early April. The rally on Friday was spurred by a better-than-expected report on the job market and resurgent hope of a ratcheting down of the trade showdown with China. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.5%. Treasury yields rose in the bond market after the government reported that employers added more jobs than forecast in April.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Stocks rallied in afternoon trading on Wall Street Friday following a stronger-than-expected report on the U.S. job market.",
      "The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, putting the index on track for a ninth straight day of gains. That would mark the longest winning streak for the benchmark index in two decades.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 582 points, or 1.4%, as of 2:35 p.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.8%.",
      "The gains were broad. Roughly 90% of stocks and every sector in the S&P 500 advanced. Technology stocks were among the companies doing the heaviest lifting. Microsoft rose 2.6% and Nvidia rose 3%. Apple, however, fell 4% after the iPhone maker estimated that tariffs will cost it $900 million.",
      "Banks and other financial companies also made solid gains. JPMorgan Chase rose 2.4% and Visa added 1.3%.",
      "Employers added 177,000 jobs in April. That marks a slowdown in hiring from March, but it was solidly better than economists anticipated. However, the latest job figures don\u2019t yet reflect the effects on the economy of President Donald Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariffs against America\u2019s trading partners. Many of the more severe tariffs that were supposed to go into effect in April were delayed by three months, with the notable exception of tariffs against China.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how financial markets will react if the administration moves forward with their initial tariff plan, so unless they take a different tack in July when the 90-day pause expires, we will see market action similar to the first week of April,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "The S&P 500 slumped 9.1% during the first week of April as Trump announced a major escalation of his trade war with more tariffs. The market has now clawed back its losses since then, helped by a string of resilient earnings reports from U.S. companies, hopes for de-escalation of trade tensions with China and expectations that the Federal Reserve will still be able to cut rates a few times this year.",
      "The job market is being closely watched for signs of stress amid trade war tensions. Strong employment has helped fuel solid consumer spending and economic growth over the last few years. Economists are now worried about the impact that taxes on imports will have on consumers and businesses, especially about how higher costs will hurt hiring and spending.",
      "The economy is already showing signs of stress. The U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace during the first quarter of the year. It was slowed by a surge in imports as businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The current round of tariffs and the on-again-off-again nature of Trump\u2019s policy has overshadowed planning for businesses and households. Companies have been cutting and withdrawing financial forecasts because of the uncertainty over how much tariffs will cost them and how much they will squeeze consumers and sap spending.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump will roll back some of his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. China has been a key target, with tariffs of 145%. Its Commerce Ministry said Beijing is evaluating overtures from the U.S. regarding the tariffs.",
      "Investors had a relatively quiet day of earnings reports following a busy week. Exxon Mobil was up 0.6%, recovering from an early slide, after reporting its lowest first-quarter profit in years. Rival Chevron rose 1.6% after it also reported its smallest first-quarter profit in years.",
      "Falling crude oil prices have weighed on the sector. Crude oil prices in the U.S. are down about 17% for the year. They fell below $60 per barrel this week, which is a level at which many producers can no longer turn a profit.",
      "Block slumped 20.5% after reporting a sharp drop in first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The financial technology company behind Cash App cited a pullback in consumer spending on travel and other discretionary items as a key reason for the results.",
      "Treasury yields rose in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.22% late Thursday.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Nearly four months after wildfires reduced thousands of Los Angeles-area homes to rubble and ash, some residents are starting to rebuild.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, construction workers recently began placing wooden beams to frame a house on a lot where only a charred fireplace remains standing. In the seaside city of Malibu and foothills neighborhood of Altadena, many land parcels where homes once stood are being cleared of debris.",
      "Hundreds of homeowners have sought city or county approval for new home designs and other permits to eventually rebuild or repair damaged homes, though few have gotten the green light to break ground.",
      "Some 17,000 homes, businesses and other structures burned to the ground in the Jan. 7 fires. It's uncertain how much will be rebuilt.",
      "Many homeowners will not be able to afford it, even those with insurance. Some are still trying to figure out whether it\u2019s safe to return to their properties, given limited data on the degree to which toxins from the fires, including lead and asbestos, may have permeated their land. Roughly 400 land parcels are already for sale in the fire-ravaged areas.",
      "Facing overwhelming loss and the chaos that comes with sudden displacement, those looking to rebuild must navigate an often confusing and time-consuming process. In most cases, it will take years for them to rebuild.",
      "LA issued its first building permit nearly two months after the fires started. It took more than seven months before the first building permit was issued following the Woolsey Fire in 2018.",
      "\u201cPutting this in context of other disasters, the speed is actually probably faster than expected,\u201d said Sara McTarnaghan, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studied the aftermath of urban wildfires in recent years in Colorado, Hawaii and California.",
      "Kathryn Frazier, a music publicist and life coach, had lived in her four-bedroom, three-bath house in Altadena for 10 years and raised her two children there. After her home burned to the ground, she was in shock and questioned whether it made sense to come back.",
      "But after conversations with neighbors, she became determined to rebuild.",

      "She is making progress. Frazier hired a crew to clear the property of debris and she is nearly through the first phase of permitting, which involves getting county review and approval for her new home's design. The next phase before receiving approval to begin construction includes reviews of electrical, plumbing and other aspects of the design.",
      "Frazier, 55, is rebuilding her home without major changes to its size or location in order to qualify for an expedited building permit approval process.",
      "\u201cWe are hoping to be building by June or July, latest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that maybe by February or March of 2026 we could be back in our home.\"",
      "For now, Frazier is getting quotes on windows, skylights and other home fixtures in hopes of locking in prices before they go up as more construction projects ramp up, or in response to the Trump administration's ongoing trade war.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing things like scouring Home Depot, finding slate tiles that look modern and beautiful, but they\u2019re actually really cheap,\" she said.",
      "DeAnn Heline, a TV showrunner, knows what it\u2019s like to build her dream house from the ground up.",
      "She waited more than two years for construction to be completed on the five-bedroom, eight-bath home with ocean views. Once the project was done, her husband vowed to never build another house. The family lived there for six years before it was destroyed in the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cIt was ash. There was nothing,\u201d Heline said.",
      "The couple, who have two daughters, have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years. They couldn\u2019t imagine giving up and not rebuilding.",

      "Recently, they cleared debris from the land where the house once stood, a particularly onerous task because the home featured a large basement into which much of the structure collapsed as it burned.",
      "Heline isn't sure when construction will begin, but figures it could be two or three years. She wonders, however, what the neighborhood will look like by then.",
      "\u201cWhat are you going back to? You\u2019re going back to a moonscape? Are you there and no one else is on your block, or are you going back to a construction zone for many more years?\" she said.",
      "The Eaton wildfire destroyed many of the more than 270 historic Janes Cottages in Altadena, including the three-bedroom home Tim Vordtriede shared with his wife and two young children.",
      "The family had only lived in the roughly 100-year-old house for three years.",
      "\u201cWe just loved the storybook cottage and the vibe, and of course the grander vibe of Altadena,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d",

      "He co-founded Altadena Collective, a group providing assistance with home designs and guidance on how to navigate the complex and lengthy approval process for rebuilding permits. Of the roughly two dozen clients that the group is serving, at reduced cost, three are in the early stages of the permitting process.",
      "Even after projects reach shovel-ready status, homeowners will have to wait perhaps more than a year before they can move in, he said.",
      "\u201cMy first statement when anyone walks in the door is: We\u2019re not here to help you design your dream home,\u201d Vordtriede said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream time. This is a nightmare, and our job is to get you out of the nightmare as soon as possible.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Home ownership is receding further out of reach for most Americans as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices stretch the limits of what buyers can afford.",
      "A homebuyer now needs to earn at least $114,000 a year to afford a $431,250 home -- the national median listing price in April, according to data released Thursday by Realtor.com",
      "The analysis assumes that a homebuyer will make a 20% down payment, finance the rest of the purchase with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and that the buyer\u2019s housing costs won't exceed 30% of their gross monthly income \u2014 an often-used barometer of housing affordability.",
      "Based off the latest U.S. median home listing price, homebuyers need to earn $47,000 more a year to afford a home than they would have just six years ago. Back then, the median U.S. home listing price was $314,950, and the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hovered around 4.1%. This week, the rate averaged 6.76%.",
      "The annual income required to afford a median-priced U.S. home first crossed into the six figures in May 2022 and hasn't dropped below that level since. Median household income was about $80,600 annually in 2023, according to the U.S. Census bureau.",
      "In several metro areas, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston, the annual income needed to afford a median-priced home tops $200,000. In San Jose, it's more than $370,000.",
      "Rock-bottom mortgage rates turbocharged the housing market during the pandemic, fueling bidding wars for homes that pushed up sale prices sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars above a seller initial asking price. U.S. home prices soared more than 50% between 2019 and 2024.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. In March, they posted their largest monthly drop since November 2022.",
      "It's not all bad news for prospective homebuyers.",
      "Home prices are rising much more slowly than during the pandemic housing market frenzy. The national median sales price of a previously occupied U.S. home rose 2.7% in March from a year earlier to $403,700, an all-time high for March, but the smallest annual increase since August.",
      "In April, the median price of a home listed for sale rose only 0.3% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Buyers who can afford current mortgage rates have a wider selection of properties now than a year ago.",
      "Active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 surged 30.6% last month from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. Home listings jumped between 67.6% and 70.1% in San Diego, San Jose and Washington D.C.",
      "As properties take longer to sell, more sellers are reducing their asking price. Some 18% of listings had their price reduced last month, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cSellers are becoming more flexible on pricing, underscored by the price reductions we\u2019re seeing, and while higher mortgage rates are certainly weighing on demand, the silver lining is that the market is starting to rebalance,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com. \"This could create opportunities for buyers who are prepared.\u201d",

    "summary": "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. House has voted to block California's vehicle emission standards",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Republican-controlled U.S. House voted Thursday to block California from enforcing first-in-the-nation rules phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The move comes a day after the chamber voted to halt California standards to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "\u201cThe passage of these resolutions is a victory for Americans who will not be forced into purchasing costly EVs because of California\u2019s unworkable mandates,\u201d House Republicans Brett Guthrie of Kentucky and Morgan Griffith of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cIf not repealed, the California waivers would lead to higher prices for both new and used vehicles, increase our reliance on China, and strain our electric grid.\u201d",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government's. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 announced plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035, as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "State regulators then formalized the rules, some other states announced plans to follow them, and the Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement them in December, a month before President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "This week's House votes fell largely along party lines, though some Democrats joined Republicans to advance them. That would be against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian, who sides with the U.S. General Accountability Office in saying California\u2019s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",
      "Republicans used the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "But the California standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, wrote in a letter to Congress in March.",
      "Newsom said the effort is another signal of Republicans' ideological shift over the decades from an era in which former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed landmark environmental laws to one in which Trump is pushing for environmental rollbacks on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change.",
      "\u201cClean air didn\u2019t used to be political,\" Newsom said in a statement. \u201cOur vehicles program helps clean the air for all Californians, and we\u2019ll continue defending it.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, which passed the vehicle emission standards, said the agency \u201cwill continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.\u201d",
      "It is unclear what will happen in the Senate. The Senate Parliamentarian in April reaffirmed the GAO\u2019s findings that California\u2019s Clean Air Act waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, according to California Sen. Adam Schiff's office.",
      "\u201cWe will fight this latest attack on California\u2019s power to protect its own residents, and I will urge my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the severe implications of proceeding with this violation of states\u2019 rights, as well as the dangerous precedent it would set by flouting the unanimous opinion of Congress\u2019 trusted arbiters,\" the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, called the use of the Congressional Review Act a \u201cbackdoor move\u201d that \u201cshows just how recklessly Republicans behave.\u201d",
      "\"Republicans may regret opening this Pandora\u2019s box, inviting attacks on many other non-rules in the future when they\u2019re no longer in charge,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "But the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers applauded Thursday's vote, calling it a \u201chuge win for U.S. consumers.\"",
      "\"California\u2019s unlawful ban should never have been authorized, and Governor Newsom should never have been allowed to seize this much control over the American vehicle market,\u201d Mike Sommers, the institute's president and CEO, and Chet Thompson, the manufacturers group's president and CEO, said in a joint statement.",

      "The bill now heads to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval, and his office hasn't said if he'll sign it. The Republican governor distanced himself from the proposal following the backlash, saying he never saw or approved plans to allow resorts and sports facilities on state park land. DeSantis leads and appoints the heads of all state agencies.",
      "The issue created a dilemma for Republican lawmakers who have traditionally defended the governor\u2019s administration, and increased scrutiny of DeSantis' record on environmental conservation.",
      "Protections for state parks are reflected \u201cloud and clear\u201d in the bill, said state Rep. John Snyder.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve put real plans in place to make sure that, for generations to come, our state parks will be preserved,\u201d said Snyder, who represents a district about an hour north of Palm Beach. He noted the parks are enjoyed by millions of residents and tourists alike.",
      "The bill doesn\u2019t ban all types of development. But any projects must be \u201cconservation-based recreational uses\u201d that support things like hiking, swimming, horseback riding, boating, studying nature and other similar activities, according to a House staff analysis.",
      "Snyder said the bill's language was strengthened by an amendment proposed in the Senate, which also added a name change for a state park in Tallahassee.",
      "The public first got wind that DeSantis' environmental agency was looking for recreational development plans in state parks when the Great Outdoors Initiative was leaked last August. Hundreds of people protested at parks and the state's environmental protection headquarters, waving signs like \u201cParks Over Profit\u201d and \u201cSave Don\u2019t Pave.\u201d",
      "Before the month was over, the governor said the Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s plans were \u201cgoing back to the drawing board.\u201d",
      "The environment secretary at the time, Shawn Hamilton, eventually stepped down after facing intensified scrutiny and bipartisan criticism of the initiative. In November, DeSantis appointed a new head of the agency, Alexis Lambert.",

      "Eli Lilly's stock wobbled Thursday after a looming coverage hit was detailed for its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound.",
      "CVS Health said the drugs Wegovy and Saxenda from rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk will become the preferred options on its standard formulary, or list of covered drugs, as of July 1. Zepbound will be excluded.",
      "This could complicate access to a drug that many patients cannot afford to pay for on their own.",
      "The formulary is maintained by CVS Health\u2019s pharmacy benefits management business, which runs prescription drug coverage for millions of people. Employers and insurers \u2014 who pay most of the prescription bill \u2014 use the formulary to decide which drugs get coverage.",
      "They can customize their coverage plans to include Zepbound. But CVS Health spokesman David Whitrap said most employers wind up using the standard formulary because of the discounts negotiated for them.",
      "Patients taking Zepbound will be able to switch to Wegovy if the Lilly drug is excluded from their coverage, Whitrap said.",
      "CVS Health also said Thursday that it will start selling Wegovy at a discounted price of about $500 monthly at thousands of drugstores for people without coverage. Novo had announced its new lower price last month.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity due to the amount of weight people lose while taking the injections. Coverage of these drugs has been patchy due to in part to their cost and the wide swath of patients who could take them.",
      "Shortages of the drugs also have made access challenging, but those have eased recently. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to pit the products against each other to negotiate lower prices in exchange for inclusion on a formulary.",
      "Lilly may have to make some price cuts to restore formulary access, said Daniel Barasa, who follows the company for Gabelli Funds. But he said he thinks big employers will still include both treatments on their lists of covered drugs, leaving the choice on what to use up to patients and doctors.",
      "Lilly said late last year that a head-to-head study of the two drugs showed that Zepbound helped patients drop more pounds.",
      "Zepbound has emerged as one of Lilly's top sellers. Its sales jumped to $2.3 billion in the recently completed first quarter. That\u2019s up from $517 million a year ago, during the drug\u2019s first full quarter on the market.",

      "Kohl\u2019s has terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation determined that he directed the retailer to engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest",
      "Kohl\u2019s has terminated its new CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation determined that he directed the retailer to engage in vendor transactions that involved undisclosed conflicts of interest.",
      "Kohl\u2019s named Chairman Michael Bender as interim CEO, effective immediately. In connection with the appointment, Bender will step down as a member of the board\u2019s audit, compensation and nominating and environmental, social and governance committee, according to the retailer's regulatory filing.",
      "The news comes nearly four months after Buchanan, who had been previously the CEO of arts and crafts chain Michaels, took over the job on January 15. Buchanan\u2019s appointment marks the third CEO for Kohl\u2019s in three years as the department store struggles to reverse sluggish sales.",
      "Kohl's said Thursday that Buchanan\u2019s firing is unrelated to its performance, financial reporting, results of operations and did not involve any of its other employees.",
      "Kohl\u2019s will conduct a search for a permanent CEO and said it will name a new chair in due course. The company couldn't be immediately be reached for comment. Buchanan didn't immediately return a message sent to his Linkedin account.",
      "According to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Buchanan's termination follows a probe conducted by outside counsel and overseen by the board's audit committee. It found Buchanan had directed that Kohl's conduct business with a vendor founded by an individual with whom Buchanan has a personal relationship on \u201chighly unusual terms favorable to the vendor\u201d and that he also caused Kohl's to enter into a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement with the same individual who was a part of the consulting team.",
      "It also found that in neither case did Buchanan disclose this relationship as required under Kohl's code of ethics.",
      "In connection with his termination and in accordance with the terms of his equity award agreements, Buchanan will forfeit all equity awards he received from the company, including the recruitment awards made as of January 15, according to the filing. Buchanan will also be required to reimburse Kohl\u2019s for a pro rata portion of his signing incentive in the amount of $2.5 million, according to the documents.",
      "As a result of Buchanan\u2019s termination, the board has determined to withdraw his nomination for election as a director of the company at the company's annual shareholders' meeting to be held on May 14.",
      "Buchanan had succeeded Tom Kingsbury, who stayed on as an adviser and is retaining his position on Kohl\u2019s board until his retirement next month. Kingsbury served as Kohl\u2019s interim CEO in December 2022 and was named its permanent leader in February 2023.",
      "The firing comes at a time when Kohl's, which operates 1,600 stores across the country, is wrestling with sluggish sales. Its middle income shoppers have pulled back on discretionary spending in the face of still-high prices for necessities. It's also faced stiff competition from Walmart and Amazon, which have been improving their fashion offerings at affordable prices.",
      "And like other retailers, it is confronting uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, Kohl's offered a preliminary look at sales and profits for the current quarter that showed continued weakness, though the expected results are on track to beat Wall Street estimates. It said that it expects to report a decline in comparable sales \u2014 those coming from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 in the range of 4.3% to 4%, and a loss of 24 cents to 20 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter.",
      "Analysts expected earnings per share loss of 54 cents and a drop in comparable sales of 6.4%, according to FactSet.",
      "It expects to report final fiscal first-quarter results on May 29.",
      "Shares of the company, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, rose nearly 9% in late morning trading.",

      "Mikko Rantanen would have never believed that he would have a hat trick in a Game 7 against Colorado",
      "DALLAS -- Mikko Rantanen figures he would have left the room in disbelief had someone told him at the beginning of this season that he would score a hat track in a Game 7 against Colorado.",
      "After all, that was the organization with which he made his NHL debut just weeks before his 19th birthday. He was there for 9 1/2 years and went to the playoffs each of the past seven seasons with the Avalanche in a run that included their 2022 Stanley Cup title.",
      "But twice traded in a six-week span earlier this year, Rantanen did exactly that and more against his original team.",
      "Rantanen assisted on Wyatt Johnston's tiebreaking power-play goal in between his first career postseason hat trick \u2014 all coming in the third period of Game 7 for the Dallas Stars on Saturday night. They overcame a two-goal deficit for a 4-2 win over the Avs to wrap up the first-round Western Conference series.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s emotional for sure because everything happened so quick,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple of months since I was still with them, playing with them, and chasing a playoff spot and stuff. And all of a sudden, a couple of months later, playing against them in a Game 7.\u201d",
      "After a four-point second period in a loss at Colorado two nights earlier, Rantanen became only the second player in NHL history to have four points in the third period of a Game 7. He also is the only of the nine players with a Game 7 hat trick to score all his goals in the final period.",
      "\u201cWe also had the benefit of a motivated guy. You know, this was Colorado and the team that he had played for for a decade,\u201d Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know all the behind the scenes what went on there, but he was a motivated guy to make an impact in this series. And he just got better and better.\u201d",
      "Rantanen, who could have become a free agent after this season, was first traded from Colorado to Carolina on Jan. 24. He played only 13 games for the Hurricanes before they sent him to Dallas in a deadline deal March 7 that included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know revenge,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cI\u2019m just happy to win as a team in the playoffs. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is.\u201d",
      "In 81 career playoff games for the Avalanche, Rantanen had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists). His last game with them was Jan. 22, but the regular season ended with him still as their third-leading scorer with 64 points (25 goals, 39 assists) in his 49 games behind Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar.",
      "Rantanen had five goals and seven assists in the seven-game series against the Avs.",
      "\u201cWhat he did in the second period the other night ... that\u2019s the thing with Mikko, is it\u2019s not about all his creating multiple chances every time he touches the puck, but big moments,\u201d Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"That\u2019s what he is, he\u2019s a pure goal scorer. He did that in the third.\u201d",
      "And sent the Avalanche home for the summer.",

      "Alvarez is a four-weight world champion and entered the fight with the WBA, WBC and WBO titles at 168 pounds.",
      "He was stripped of the IBF belt last July when he declined to make a mandatory defense against Scull. He\u2019d owned that title since November 2021 when he defeated Caleb Plant.",
      "Alvarez became an undisputed titlist in the division for the second time when the judges scored it 115-113, 116-112, 119-109. The 34-year-old Mexican champion improved to 63-2-2, with 39 knockouts, and is unbeaten in 10 fights in the super middleweight category.",
      "The fight against IBF champion Scull didn\u2019t live up to the hype. The Cuba-born Scull entered unbeaten in 23 professional fights. He constantly moved around, dodging, shuffling and frustrating Alvarez, who later said he hated fighting that style of boxer.",
      "Moments after the decision was declared, the promotion for a proposed Sept. 12 fight between Alvarez and Terence Crawford began, with both men facing each other in the ring.",
      "Alvarez was fighting outside the U.S. or Mexico for the first time and had to make plenty of adjustments, including to the time zone. The fighters walked into the ring and the anthems started around 6:20 a.m. local time (11:20 p.m. ET Saturday) for the main bout in Riyadh, timed so it was in prime time on the U.S. West Coast.",
      "The opening rounds were slow with both boxers feeling for range and the intensity gradually lifted with Scull throwing many more punches but not landing enough. Alvarez, by contrast, stayed patient and was landing body shots. In the end, Alvarez threw almost half as many punches as Scull (152-293) but landed one more (56-55), predominantly power shots to the body.",
      "\u201cIt's OK, we won. We're here with the title as the champion,\" Alvarez said, adding that neither the timing of the bout nor the quality of the contest was a problem because he'd plenty of time to prepare. \u201cI'm a champion. I\u2019m a professional, so that\u2019s all, no excuse or anything.\u201d",

      "Not this time: The Denver Nuggets\u2019 second-half lead was way too big for them to fritter away",
      "DENVER -- Nikola Jokic got plenty of help from his teammates and the Denver Nuggets weren\u2019t about to let up when they built a big lead and raced past the Los Angeles Clippers in a 120-101 Game 7 laugher Saturday night.",
      "The No. 4 seed Nuggets, who led by as many as 35 points, advanced to take on the No. 1 seeded Oklahoma City Thunder, which swept Memphis in the first round and has had a week off. The teams split their season series 2-2, with both teams winning one on the road.",
      "The Clippers\u2019 season came to a screeching halt after they\u2019d entered the playoffs as the hottest team in the league, having won 18 of 21.",
      "Jokic had 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Aaron Gordon led Denver with 22 points, Christian Braun had 21, Jamal Murray and Russell Westbrook chipped in 16 each and Michael Porter Jr. scored 15.",
      "Kawhi Leonard led Los Angeles with 22 points but James Harden only scored 7 points on 2-of-8 shooting and Ivica Zubac had his quietest game of the series with 10 points.",
      "Hanging over the Nuggets all season was their Game 7 fiasco in Round 2 last year when they blew a 20-point second-half lead to the Minnesota Timberwolves just when it looked like they were primed to defend the franchise\u2019s first NBA championship.",
      "And after frittering away a 22-point fourth-quarter advantage in Game 4 of this series \u2014 only to be saved by the first buzzer-beating dunk in NBA playoff history, courtesy of Gordon \u2014 the Nuggets and Ball Arena crowd only grew more energized instead of anxious as the lead kept growing and the Clippers kept missing.",
      "The Nuggets blew this one open with a 17-0 run in the third quarter after Leonard started the second half with a 3-pointer to cut L.A.\u2019s deficit to 58-50.",
      "Los Angeles led 26-21 after one quarter but the Clippers were outscored 72-40 during the second and third quarters to trail 93-66 heading into the fourth quarter.",
      "After picking up his third, fourth and fifth fouls over a 48-second span late in the third, Jokic went to the bench and watched his team continue to roll. He sat the entire fourth quarter.",
      "The Nuggets began celebrating early in the fourth quarter when Westbrook willingly took a technical for hanging on the rim and swinging back and forth after his steal and dunk put Denver up 107-76.",
      "And Denver interim coach David Adelman emptied his bench with a 111-81 lead with 5:23 left. But the Clippers went on a 7-0 run and Adelman sent his starters back in at the 4-minute mark.",
      "The Clippers ended up cutting a 35-point deficit into the teens but Denver\u2019s lead, for a change, was too big to overcome. Their 19-point win was their biggest in a Game 7 in the franchise\u2019s playoff history.",
      "Courtesy of team owner Steve Ballmer, more than 100 Clippers fans were flown to Denver and assembled behind one of the baskets to provide extra noise. It\u2019s an extension of \u201cThe Wall,\u201d a section for the group of superfans that packs the Intuit Dome \u2014 also behind a basket \u2014 for Clippers games in Los Angeles.",
      "The Nuggets had lost four of their previous five closeout games since winning the franchise\u2019s only NBA championship two years ago. The Clippers also were the victims the last time Denver won a Game 7. That came in the conference semifinals in the Florida bubble when the Nuggets overcame a 3-1 series deficit.",

It apologized for the delay of a game, the release of which has been talked about for several years. It didn't provide any specifics on why the release date has been pushed back from fall of this year.",

      "Shares of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar\u2019s parent company, fell Friday by nearly 7%.",
      "Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO for Take-Two Interactive Software, stood by Rockstar in a statement and said it supports the company taking additional time to realize their creative vision.

      "Two major scientific societies say they will fill the void from the Trump administration\u2019s dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two major scientific societies on Friday said they will fill the void from the Trump administration's dismissal of scientists writing a cornerstone federal report on what climate change is doing to the United States.",
      "The American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they will work together to produce peer-reviewed research documents assessing the current and future national impacts of climate change because a science-based report required by law is suddenly in question and being reassessed by President Donald Trump's White House.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump's Republican administration told about 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment that they were no longer needed and that the report was being reevaluated. That report, coming once every four to five years, is required by a 1990 federal law and was due out around 2027. Preliminary budget documents show slashing funding or eliminating offices involved in coordinating that report, scientists and activists said.",
      "\u201cWe are filling in a gap in the scientific process,\u201d AGU President Brandon Jones said. \u201cIt's more about ensuring that science continues.\u201d",
      "Meteorological society past president Anjuli Bamzi, a retired federal atmospheric scientist who has worked on previous National Climate Assessments, said one of the most important parts of the federal report is that it projects 25 and 100 years into the future.",
      "With the assessment \u201cwe're better equipped to deal with the future,\u201d Bamzi said. \u201cWe can't be an ostrich and put our head in the sand and let it go.\u201d",
      "Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, also chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy, said the two organizations joining to do this report \u201cis a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available.\u201d",
      "Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and 2023, said \u201cpeople are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it\u2019s the size of the storm sewer pipes they\u2019re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.\"",
      "They need that knowledge to figure out how to adapt to harms in the future and even the present, Hayhoe said.",
      "The national assessment, unlike global United Nations documents, highlights what\u2019s happening to weather not just in the nation but at regional and local levels.",
      "Jones said he hopes the societies' version of the assessment can be done in just one year.",
      "The last climate assessment report, released in 2023, said that climate change is \u201dharming physical, mental, spiritual, and community health and well-being through the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events, increasing cases of infectious and vector-borne diseases, and declines in food and water quality and security.\"",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, the assessment was just as blunt, saying: \"Climate change creates new risks and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United States, presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.\"",
      "But University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles, who led one of 2018's two national reports, said he worries about what kind of document this new administration will try to issue, if any.",
      "\u201cI think they'll put out something that will, like, it'll be be scientifically based, but it will be pretty crappy,\u201d Wuebbles told The Associated Press.",
      "Watering down or killing the national assessment will not keep the message about the importance of climate change from getting out, Wuebbles said. The scientific societies' efforts to fill the void will have some value because it will be a statement of the scientific community, and, in the end, he said, science is about data and observations.",
      "\u201cWe know this is an extremely important problem. We know it is human activities driving it. So the question is: What do you do about it?\u201d Wuebbles said.",
      "Storms and wildfires don't care if it's a red state or a blue state, Hayhoe said.",

      "A Wisconsin man has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times, and scientists are studying his blood to treat snakebite",
      "NEW YORK -- Tim Friede has been bitten by snakes hundreds of times \u2014 often on purpose. Now scientists are studying his blood in hopes of creating a better treatment for snake bites.",
      "Friede has long had a fascination with reptiles and other venomous creatures. He used to milk scorpions' and spiders' venom as a hobby and kept dozens of snakes at his Wisconsin home.",
      "Hoping to protect himself from snake bites \u2014 and out of what he calls \u201csimple curiosity\u201d \u2014 he began injecting himself with small doses of snake venom and then slowly increased the amount to try to build up tolerance. He would then let snakes bite him.",
      "\u201cAt first, it was very scary,\" Friede said. \u201cBut the more you do it, the better you get at it, the more calm you become with it.\u201d",
      "While no doctor or emergency medical technician \u2014 or anyone, really \u2014 would ever suggest this is a remotely good idea, experts say his method tracks how the body works. When the immune system is exposed to the toxins in snake venom, it develops antibodies that can neutralize the poison. If it's a small amount of venom the body can react before it's overwhelmed. And if it's venom the body has seen before, it can react more quickly and handle larger exposures.",
      "Friede has withstood snakebites and injections for nearly two decades and still has a refrigerator full of venom. In videos posted to his YouTube channel, he shows off swollen fang marks on his arms from black mamba, taipan and water cobra bites.",
      "\u201cI wanted to push the limits as close to death as possible to where I\u2019m just basically teetering right there and then back off of it,\" he said.",
      "But Friede also wanted to help. He emailed every scientist he could find, asking them to study the tolerance he'd built up.",
      "And there is a need: Around 110,000 people die from snakebite every year, according to the World Health Organization. And making antivenom is expensive and difficult. It is often created by injecting large mammals like horses with venom and collecting the antibodies they produce. These antivenoms are usually only effective against specific snake species, and can sometimes produce bad reactions due to their nonhuman origins.",
      "When Columbia University's Peter Kwong heard of Friede, he said, \u201cOh, wow, this is very unusual. We had a very special individual with amazing antibodies that he created over 18 years.\u201d",
      "In a study published Friday in the journal Cell, Kwong and collaborators shared what they were able to do with Friede's unique blood: They identified two antibodies that neutralize venom from many different snake species with the aim of someday producing a treatment that could offer broad protection.",
      "It's very early research \u2014 the antivenom was only tested in mice, and researchers are still years away from human trials. And while their experimental treatment shows promise against the group of snakes that include mambas and cobras, it's not effective against vipers, which include snakes like rattlers.",
      "\u201cDespite the promise, there is much work to do,\u201d said Nicholas Casewell, a snakebite researcher at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in an email. Casewell was not involved with the new study.",
      "Friede's journey has not been without its missteps. Among them: He said after one bad snake bite he had to cut off part of his finger. And some particularly nasty cobra bites sent him to the hospital.",
      "Friede is now employed by Centivax, which is trying to develop the treatment, and he's excited that his 18-year odyssey could one day save lives from snakebite. But his message to those inspired to follow in his footsteps is quite simple: \u201cDon't do it,\" he said.",

      "LONDON -- British retailer Marks & Spencer said Friday that it's \u201cworking day and night\u201d to resolve a cyberattack nearly two weeks ago that has left it unable to process any online orders, a day after luxury London department store Harrods confirmed it had become the latest target.",
      "With Co-op also having shut down some of its information technology systems as a precaution following a hack, there are growing concerns within the retail sector that hackers are taking calculated risks by trying to replicate the actions of others to cause as much disruption as they can.",
      "According to reports, a hacking group known as Scattered Spider is said to be behind the M&S attack, although this hasn't been confirmed. It remains unclear if the three attacks are linked.",
      "So far, M&S has been the most high-profile victim of the recent spate of attacks, and its chief executive Stuart Machin told customers that he is \u201creally sorry\u201d about the disruption.",
      "\u201cWe are working day and night to manage the current cyber incident and get things back to normal for you as quickly as possible,\" he said.",
      "M&S first reported the issue over the Easter weekend two weeks ago and has seen its operations impacted for more than a week. Initially, the company saw contactless payments and click and collect orders affected, though contactless has since been restored.",
      "Last Friday, it also said it would no longer be able to take orders through its website or app in order to deal with the problem. And the company, which has around 65,000 employees, has been unable to hire new workers after pulling job postings from its website.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police force has launched an investigation into the attack on M&S.",
      "M&S's latest update comes a day after Harrods said it had restricted internet access across its sites as a precautionary measure following an attempt to gain unauthorized access to its systems.",
      "\u201cWe are not asking our customers to do anything differently at this point, and we will continue to provide updates as necessary,\" Harrods said in a statement.",
      "\u201cComing on the heels of recent breaches at Co-op and M&S, it highlights an alarming trend,\" said Cody Barrow, chief executive of cybersecurity experts EclecticIQ. \u201cThe flurry of attacks showed cybercriminals are becoming bolder, exploiting weaknesses across complex, highly interconnected supply chains.\u201d",
      "Experts are saying that generative artificial intelligence is accelerating the threat landscape, and that firms and individuals have to stay on top of developments and shore up their defenses against cyberattacks.",
      "The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre said that it was working with organizations affected as well as providing expert advice to others in the sector.",
      "\u201cThese incidents should act as a wake-up call to all organizations,\" agency CEO Richard Horne said.",

      "A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus in the 1970s is expected to soon plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly within the first two weeks of May.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph (242 kph), if it remains intact.",
      "\u201cWhile not without risk, we should not be too worried,\u201d Langbroek said in an email.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\u201d",
      "The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus (nearly 500-kilogram) spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \u201cit'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\u201d",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \u201cchances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\u201d Langbroek said.",

      "\u201cShe just nails that one,\u201d swaying her head in time to the tempo changes, said Peter Cook, a behavioral neuroscientist at New College of Florida who has spent a decade studying Ronan\u2019s rhythmic abilities.",
      "Not many animals show a clear ability to identify and move to a beat aside from humans, parrots and some primates. But then there\u2019s Ronan, a bright-eyed sea lion that has scientists rethinking the meaning of music.",
      "A former rescue sea lion, she burst to fame around a decade ago after scientists reported her musical skills. From age 3, she has been a resident at the University of California, Santa Cruz\u2019s Long Marine Laboratory, where researchers including Cook have tested and honed her ability to recognize rhythms.",
      "Ronan joined a select group of animal movers and shakers -- which also includes Snowball the famed dancing cockatoo -- that together upended the long-held idea that the ability to respond to music and recognize a beat was distinctly human.",
      "What is particularly notable about Ronan is that she can learn to dance to a beat without learning to sing or talk musically.",
      "\u201cScientists once believed that only animals who were vocal learners \u2014 like humans and parrots \u2014 could learn to find a beat,\u201d said Hugo Merchant, a researcher at Mexico\u2019s Institute of Neurobiology, who was not involved in the Ronan research.",
      "But in the years since since Ronan came into the spotlight, questions emerged about whether she still had it. Was her past dancing a fluke? Was Ronan better than people at keeping a beat?",
      "To answer the challenge, Cook and colleagues devised a new study, published Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports.",
      "The result: Ronan still has it. She\u2019s back and she\u2019s better than ever.",
      "This time the researchers focused not on studio music but on percussion beats in a laboratory. They filmed Ronan bobbing her head as the drummer played three different tempos \u2014 112, 120, and 128 beats per minute. Two of those beats Ronan had never been exposed to, allowing scientists to test her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms.",
      "And the researchers asked 10 college students to do the same, waving their forearm to changing beats.",
      "Ronan was the top diva.",
      "\u201cNo human was better than Ronan at all the different ways we test quality of beat-keeping,\u201d said Cook, adding that \"she's much better than when she was a kid,\u201d indicating lifetime learning.",
      "The new study confirms Ronan's place as one of the \u201ctop ambassadors\u201d of animal musicality, said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has filed a defamation lawsuit against Meta alleging that the social media giant's artificial intelligence chatbot spread false statements about him, including that he participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Starbuck, known for targeting corporate DEI programs, said he discovered the claims made by Meta's AI in August 2024, when he was going after \u201cwoke DEI\u201d policies at motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson.",
      "\u201cOne dealership was unhappy with me and they posted a screenshot from Meta\u2019s AI in an effort to attack me,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cThis screenshot was filled with lies. I couldn\u2019t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.\u201d",
      "Since then, he said he has \u201cfaced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.\u201d",
      "The political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.",
      "In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that \u201cas part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.\u201d",
      "Starbuck's lawsuit joins the ranks of several other similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.",
      "When Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta's AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta\u2019s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.",
      "According to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to \"retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.\u201d",
      "The filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or \u201ctake meaningful responsibility for its conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it \u2018fixed\u2019 the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck\u2019s name from its written responses altogether,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",

      "Kaplan said he is working with Meta's product team to \u201cunderstand how this happened and explore potential solutions.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been \u201carrested or charged with a single crime in his life.\u201d",
      "Meta later \u201cblacklisted\u201d Starbuck's name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta\u2019s AI could flip votes that decide the election,\u201d Starbuck said on X. \u201cYou could be the next target too.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement that will give the U.S. access to Ukraine's vast critical mineral resources",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Ukraine on Wednesday signed an agreement granting American access to Ukraine\u2019s vast mineral resources, finalizing a deal months in the making that could enable continued military aid to Kyiv amid concerns that President Donald Trump might scale back support in ongoing peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The two sides offered only barebone details about the structure of the deal, which they called the United States-Ukraine Reinvestment Fund. But it is expected to give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable rare earth minerals while providing Kyiv a measure of assurance about continued American support in its grinding war with Russia.",
      "\u201cThis agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides\u2019 commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a critical moment in the three-year war as Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with both sides. The signing comes two months after a different but similar agreement was nearly signed before being derailed in a tense Oval Office meeting involving President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Trump has long criticized Zelenskyy, saying he didn\u2019t \u201chave the cards\u201d to win the war and blaming him for prolonging the killing by not giving up Crimea, but in recent days has rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin as well, saying he was complicating negotiations with \u201cvery bad timing\u201d in launching deadly strikes on Kyiv.",
      "Trump said Wednesday night on NewsNation that the deal, \u201cin theory,\u201d means that the U.S. will get more from Ukraine than it contributed. \u201cI wanted to be protected,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t want to be looking \u201cfoolish\u201d by not getting money back for the investment.",
      "For Ukraine, the agreement is seen as key to ensuring its access to future U.S. military aid.",
      "\u201cTruly, this is a strategic deal for the creation of an investment partner fund,\u201d said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \u201cThis is truly an equal and good international deal on joint investment in the development and restoration of Ukraine between the governments of the United States and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, flew to Washington on Wednesday to help finalize the deal.",
      "\u201cTogether with the United States, we are creating the Fund that will attract global investment to our country,\u201d she said in a post on X after the signing.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bessent said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House \u2014 hours after Ukrainian officials indicated a deal was nearly finalized \u2014 that there was still work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,\" Bessent said when asked about reports that Ukraine was ready to agree to the pact. \"We\u2019re sure that they will reconsider that. And we are ready to sign this afternoon if they are.\u201d",
      "He didn't elaborate as to the late changes he said Ukraine made.",
      "The U.S. has been seeking access to more than 20 raw materials deemed strategically critical to its interests, including some non-minerals such as oil and natural gas. Among them are Ukraine's deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries.",
      "After Kyiv felt the initial U.S. draft of the deal disproportionately favored American interests, it introduced new provisions aimed at addressing those concerns.",
      "According to Shmyhal, the latest version would establish an equal partnership between the two countries and last for 10 years. Financial contributions to a joint fund would be made in cash, and only new U.S. military aid would count toward the American share. Assistance provided before the agreement was signed would not be counted. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine\u2019s path toward European Union membership \u2014 a key provision for Kyiv.",
      "The Ukrainian Cabinet approved the agreement Wednesday, empowering Svyrydenko to sign it in Washington. The deal still needs to be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament before it can take effect.",
      "The negotiations come amid rocky progress in Washington's push to stop the war.",
      "Putin backs calls for a ceasefire before peace negotiations, \u201cbut before it\u2019s done, it\u2019s necessary to answer a few questions and sort out a few nuances,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Putin is also ready for direct talks with Ukraine without preconditions to seek a peace deal, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realize that Washington wants to achieve quick progress, but we hope for understanding that the Ukrainian crisis settlement is far too complex to be done quickly,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "Trump has expressed frustration over the slow pace of progress in negotiations aimed at stopping the war. Western European leaders have accused Putin of stalling while his forces seek to grab more Ukrainian land. Russia has captured nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since Moscow's forces launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Trump has long dismissed the war as a waste of lives and American taxpayer money \u2014 a complaint he repeated Wednesday during his Cabinet meeting. That could spell an end to crucial military help for Ukraine and heavier economic sanctions on Russia.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday tried again to push both sides to move more quickly and warned that the U.S. could pull out of the negotiations if there's no progress.",
      "\u201cWe are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,\" department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce quoted Secretary of State Marco Rubio as telling her.",
      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt to Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and Western arms supplies to Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed Wednesday that Ukraine had accepted an unconditional truce only because it was being pushed back on the battlefield, where the bigger Russian forces have the upper hand.",
      "Meanwhile, Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded in attacks every day this year, according to a U.N. report presented Tuesday in New York.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office said in the report that in the first three months of this year, it had verified 2,641 civilian casualties in Ukraine. That was almost 900 more than during the same period last year.",
      "Also, between April 1-24, civilian casualties in Ukraine were up 46% from the same weeks in 2024, it said.",
      "The daily grind of the war shows no sign of letting up. A nighttime Russian drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, wounded at least 45 civilians, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Security Service claimed its drones struck the Murom Instrument Engineering Plant in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region overnight, causing five explosions and a fire at the military facility. The claim could not be independently verified.",

      "The crew\u2019s landing module came down slowly after separating from the return vehicle, descending on a red-and-white parachute, in Dongfeng, in China\u2019s northern Inner Mongolia region on the edge of the Gobi Desert.

      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major player in a new era of space exploration and the use of permanent stations to conduct experiments in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.",
      "China\u2019s space program is controlled by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has issued a new policy for terminating international students' legal status",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status.",
      "The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status canceled in recent weeks with little explanation.",
      "In the past month, foreign students around the U.S. have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some went into hiding for fear of deportation or abandoned their studies to return home.",
      "On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be canceled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the U.S.",
      "Brad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status. In the past, if a student had their visa revoked, they could stay in the U.S. to finish their studies \u2014 they simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "\u201cThis just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d Banias said.",
      "Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including traffic violations. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.",
      "Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated \u2014 and then reinstated \u2014 this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.",
      "In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.",
      "In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped \u2014 information that is also in NCIC.",
      "Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: \u201cPlease terminate all in SEVIS.\u201d That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the U.S.",
      "Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.",
      "\u201cAll of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,\u201d said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated \u201can utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.\u201d",
      "When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "In some cases this spring, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes immediately and warned them they could be deported.",
      "Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled \u201cfailure to maintain status.\u201d Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an \u201cinvestigative red flag.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Patel is lawfully present in the U.S.,\u201d Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. \u201cHe is not subject to immediate detention or removal.\u201d",
      "Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the U.S.",

      "The United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket carried up 27 of Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites, named after the frigid fringes of our solar system beyond Neptune. Once released in orbit, the satellites will eventually reach an altitude of nearly 400 miles (630 kilometers).",
      "Two test satellites were launched in 2023, also by an Atlas V. Project officials said major upgrades were made to the newest version. The latest satellites also are coated with a mirror film designed to scatter reflected sunlight in an attempt to accommodate astronomers.",
      "Stargazers oppose the fast-growing constellations of low-orbiting satellites, arguing they spoil observations. Others fear more satellite collisions.",
      "Founded by Jeff Bezos, who now runs his own rocket company, Blue Origin, Amazon aims to put more than 3,200 of these satellites into orbit to provide fast, affordable broadband service around the globe.",
      "Elon Musk's SpaceX already has launched more than 8,000 Starlinks since 2019. The company marked its 250th Starlink launch Sunday night. More than 7,000 Starlinks are still in orbit some 300-plus miles (550 kilometers) above Earth.",
      "The European-based OneWeb satellite constellation numbers in the hundreds in an even higher orbit.",
      "Amazon already has purchased dozens of rocket launches from United Launch Alliance and Blue Origin for Project Kuiper, as well as others.",

      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a lopsided margin among the small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk\u2019s employees at SpaceX. With all the votes in, the tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, according to results published online by the Cameron County Elections Department.",
      "Musk celebrated in a post on his social platform, X, saying it is \u201cnow a real city!\u201d",

      "Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021 and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers.",
      "The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire\u2019s popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump\u2019s federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.",
      "But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk\u2019s personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.",
      "Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town\u2019s mayor and city council.",
      "All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.",
      "SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they to want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "\u201cWe need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\u201d Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot.",
      "The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \u201cthe provisions of schooling and medical care\u201d for those living on the property.",
      "SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Critics say beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change.",
      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn\u2019t comply with an order to evacuate the beach.",
      "The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, held another demonstration Saturday that attracted dozens of people.",

      "\"Prices are still going up,\" one expert said.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday claimed grocery and gas prices are falling, an assertion he's made repeatedly since taking office.",
      "In a post on social media, Trump touted the price levels alongside job growth and tax revenue in a list of gains delivered by his tariff policy.",
      "\"We're only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!\" Trump said.",
      "The claim of a reduction in prices for those essential goods, however, is potentially misleading, economists told ABC News. Since Trump took office, price hikes for food have accelerated and gas prices have stood essentially flat, federal government data shows.",
      "To be sure, overall inflation has eased slightly during Trump's tenure. In January, the year-over-year inflation rate stood at 3%; as of March, the most recent month on record, that rate registered at 2.4%, government data showed. That figure comes in well below a peak attained in 2022.",
      "Even a relatively low level of inflation indicates an increase in price levels, however, since inflation measures the pace of change in prices, David Bieri, an economist at Virginia Tech University, told ABC News.",
      "\"Prices are still going up \u2013 they're just not going up as rapidly,\" Bieri told ABC News.",
      "On April 24, Trump told reporters at the Oval Office: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump repeated the claim on social media on Friday, saying, \"Groceries (and eggs!) down.\"",
      "Grocery prices, which make up a significant share of household budgets, are measured in government price data under the category of \"food at home,\" which sets such items apart from those purchased at restaurants or other dine-out venues.",
      "In January, food at home prices increased 1.9% compared to a year earlier. As of March, the year-over-year inflation rate for such products had accelerated to 2.4%, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed.",
      "When asked about Trump's claim that food prices are falling, Tucker Balch, a finance professor at Emory University, said: \"I'm not aware of any data that supports that.\"",
      "Egg prices -- another cost highlighted by Trump -- have climbed over the early months of Trump's term. In March, egg prices soared 60% higher than a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "Bird flu has continued to decimate the egg supply, lifting prices, researchers at the University of Tennessee and Mississippi State University found in February.",
      "By contrast, wholesale egg prices -- the amount grocers pay to suppliers -- have dropped significantly since Trump took office, food economists previously told ABC News. It remains unclear when and to what extent that decline in wholesale egg prices will translate into relief for consumers, they said.",
      "While food prices are rising overall, costs for some food items are dropping. Staples like rice, pasta, potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes registered lower prices in March than they had a year prior, BLS data showed.",
      "\"You can always find particular food prices that are falling,\" Carola Binder, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies inflation, told ABC News. \"There are probably some people out there whose basket of prices is falling because of what they're buying.\"",
      "Trump claimed last month that gasoline prices had fallen as low as $1.98 in a couple of states. On Friday, Trump voiced a similar assertion on social media, saying, \"Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years.\"",
      "The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline stands at $3.18, AAA data shows. No state boasts an average price close to $1.98, the data shows.",
      "In Mississippi, the state with the lowest average price, a gallon of gas costs $2.66, AAA says.",
      "Even more, government data shows average gas prices are little changed since Trump took office.",
      "Over the week ending on Jan. 20, the national average price of a gallon of gas stood at $3.10, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA. As of the week ending on April 28, the most recent on record, the average price landed at $3.13, EIA says.",
      "\"That puts gas prices right around where they were when Trump took office,\" Binder said.",
      "By contrast, oil prices have plummeted about 25% since Trump took office. In theory, the decline in the price of oil should eventually push down the price of gasoline, since oil makes up the key input in the refined product that ends up in vehicles, Binder said.",
      "The drop in oil prices is not necessarily a positive indicator, they added. Falling oil prices often suggest expectations of an economic slowdown that would diminish energy demand.",
      "Balch, of Emory University, said the decline in oil prices resulted from expectations of a slowdown in global trade in the aftermath of Trump's tariffs.",
      "\"It's a measure of the expected use of energy in our economy,\" Balch said. \"It is because of Trump's policies but it's not an endorsement of his policies.\"",

      "Trump signed the executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to \"cease direct funding to NPR and PBS\" on his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on Thursday",
      "The order blocks federal funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law, according to a fact sheet from the White House. It also prevents indirect funding to PBS and NPR by prohibiting local public radio and television stations, and any other recipients of CPB funds, from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.",
      "The order mandates that the CPB revise its 2025 General Provisions to explicitly prohibit direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS. It directs all federal agencies to terminate any direct or indirect funding to NPR and PBS and to review existing grants and contracts for compliance. Additionally, it instructs the Federal Communications Commission and relevant agencies to investigate whether NPR and PBS have engaged in unlawful discrimination.",
      "In the fact sheet, the White House claims the two news organizations \"have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "In an interview with ABC News on Friday, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger said a loss in federal funding would hit audiences in rural communities hard. Kerger said that their access to stations has been historically dependent on government funding and that content from children's programming to backup emergency alerts could be negatively impacted by cuts.",
      "\"They formed PBS as a way that we could bring the dollars together from around the country from all of our stations,\" Kerger said. \"That would help us create the kids content that people have loved for many decades and that have really raised generations of children.\"",
      "For some stations, the situation could be dire, she said.",
      "\"For a number of smaller stations, it really could be an existential challenge,\" Kerger said. \"That means the existence of those very stations.\"",
      "Kerger and the head of NPR testified at a House hearing in March about their funding.",
      "\"I hear, respect and understand your concerns regarding bias and whether public media is relevant in a commercial landscape,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said at the hearing. \"It is critical for NPR's newsroom to operate with the highest journalistic standards. That means they do their jobs independently, and as CEO I have no editorial role at NPR.\"",
      "NPR and PBS are primarily funded through a combination of public and private sources. The CPB, a federal agency, provides a portion of the funding, along with private donations from individuals, foundations and corporations. The CPB oversees dozens of media organizations in addition to NPR and PBS, including everything from American Public Media to Native Public Media and Public Media in Mid-America.",
      "Those in the Senate and House quickly responded along party lines.",
      "\"The fact that taxpayers are forced to subsidize far-left propaganda outlets like NPR is an outrage,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. \"I commend President Trump for his common-sense order ending taxpayer funding for liberal media outlets.",
      "\"President Trump is once again walking us towards authoritarianism, by eliminating funds for PBS and NPR, claiming it will stop 'biased and partisan news coverage,'\" Rep.

    "story": [
      "Several Republicans criticized the proposal, taking issue with defense numbers.",
      "The White House on Friday released President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, which calls for $163 billion in cuts to federal spending.",
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, in a letter to Congress alongside the proposal, said the cuts to discretionary funding would lead to \"significant savings.\"",
      "\"The President is proposing base non-defense discretionary budget authority $163 billion -- 22.6 percent below -- current-year spending, while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure,\" Vought wrote.",
      "While budget proposals are essentially a wish-list for the administration, they serve to illustrate the president's priorities and what the White House hopes is a jumping off point for negotiations with Congress.",
      "The cuts proposed would come from the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, USAID and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others.",
      "However, Trump is proposing a 13% increase to defense spending to bring it to $1.01 trillion for the next fiscal year, Vought said.",
      "The administration's also proposing $175 billion to go toward the southern border and $134 million to strengthen trade enforcement.",
      "Trump's proposal was met with criticism from Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who pushed back on the White House account of defense spending.",
      "\"For the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms,\" Wicker wrote in a statement.",
      "\"OMB is not requesting a trillion-dollar budget. It is requesting a budget of $892.6 billion, which is a cut in real terms. This budget would decrease President Trump's military options and his negotiating leverage,\" Wicker said.",
      "Several Republicans who have been unafraid to challenge President Trump also issued statements critical of his budget request.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she has \"serious objections to the proposed freeze in our defense funding given the challenges we face the proposed funding cuts to -- and in some cases elimination of -- programs like LIHEAP, TRIO, and those that support biomedical research.",
      "\"Ultimately, it is Congress that holds the power of the purse,\" she said.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, also took issue with the defense spending numbers in Trump's proposal.",
      "\"America cannot expect our allies to heed calls for greater annual defense spending if we are unwilling to lead by example. Fortunately, Presidential budget requests are just that: requests. Congress will soon have an opportunity to ensure that American power -- and the credibility of our commitments -- are appropriately resourced. I hope and expect that my colleagues will join me in placing America's national security first as we begin the FY26 appropriations process,\" McConnell said.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed alarm the request could severely slash programs many Americans rely on.",
      "\"President Trump has made his priorities clear as day: he wants to outright defund programs that help working Americans while he shovels massive tax breaks at billionaires like himself and raises taxes on middle-class Americans with his reckless tariffs,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "\"This preliminary budget proposal is exceptionally light on details we desperately need -- but this much is clear: Trump wants to eviscerate programs that matter most to working families,\" Murray said.",
      "Where Trump's 2026 budget proposal would cut funding",
      "The budget proposal takes aim at programs that the administration has attacked in the past.",
      "It would cut funding at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which a senior White House official said had \"abusive regulatory decrees\" on gun owners. Cuts would also be in store for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which the official claimed is used to \"target conservative organizations.\"",
      "The budget also calls for huge cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services, including for programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It also has many cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",
      "The proposed budget also eliminates USAID's foreign aid, instead putting some foreign aid under the State Department's budget.",
      "There was one notable program that the administration is looking to gut: a benefit program called LIHEAP, which helps subsidize energy bills for low-income individuals across the U.S.",
      "The cutting of funds to this program also runs counter to one of President Trump's campaign promise that he will lower energy bills for Americans on Day 1. A senior White House official, when asked about the proposed cuts to LIHEAP, claimed there was abuse and fraud relating to the program.",
      "\"We don't need a benefit hammock that keeps people out of the workforce. So LIHEAP is actually a fairly critical one of our reductions for accomplishing a lot of trying to get people back to work and dealing with the excessiveness of that, of that benefit,\" the senior White House said.",

    "summary": "Experts are pushing back after the HHS released a report, calling for the use of psychotherapy among children and teens with gender dysphoria over gender-affirming care.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say gender-affirming care is safe and improves youth mental health.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released what it called a \"comprehensive review\" of transgender care for children and teens on Thursday, calling for broader use of psychotherapy for young people with gender dysphoria rather than gender-affirming care.",
      "The more than 400-page document details alleged harms from medical interventions for youth, including the use of puberty blockers, and alleged risks, such as infertility.",
      "The \"review of evidence and best practices report\" is a response to a January executive order issued by President Donald Trump, saying the federal government would not \"fund, sponsor, promote, assist or support\" transition care for those under age 19.",
      "\"Our duty is to protect our nation's children -- not expose them to unproven and irreversible medical interventions,\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement on Thursday. \"We must follow the gold standard of science, not activist agendas.\"",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by multiple major medical organizations. It can range from allowing a child to pick their pronouns to treatments typically prescribed for older teens. Studies show treatments are generally safe and that care has a positive impact on mental health, which psychotherapy alone cannot provide, experts said.",
      "\"Requiring that somebody [go] through a prescribed course of therapy can be misused by governments to try to essentially block access to care,\" Dr. Dan Karasic, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, told ABC News. \"There just isn't evidence that psychotherapy resolves gender dysphoria.\"",
      "Safety of puberty blockers, hormone therapies",
      "One of the most common treatments in gender-affirming care is the use of puberty blockers, which are used to delay the onset of puberty among transgender and gender-diverse youth.",
      "The report claimed its review of studies found low evidence that puberty blockers are safe or that they improved mental health among children with gender dysphoria, and \"high certainty evidence\" that they often cause infertility.",
      "The reported also stated, \"Low certainty evidence suggests that puberty blockers may compromise bone health.\"",
      "However, studies have shown that adults who used puberty blockers in the past experienced menstrual cycles, childbirth and miscarriages at similar rates to those of the general population.",
      "Dr. Morissa Ladinsky, a clinical professor in pediatrics at Stanford University in California, said puberty blockers have been used as a treatment for more than 30 years, primarily for a condition called CPP, or central precocious puberty, which is when puberty begins too early.",
      "\"These medications are immensely well-studied,\" she told ABC News. \"The long-term effects of puberty-pausing medications, when used in children, for temporary periods of time, do function as a completely reversible pause button.\"",
      "She said side effects related to sexual function or bone density are usually seen among adults, who may take the medications for prostate cancer in order to reduce testosterone, or endometriosis.",
      "The HHS report also discussed cross-sex hormones, more commonly known as hormone therapies, claiming there is \"high certainty evidence\" that hormone therapies have \"physiological effects\" and that many studies were \"not specifically designed to capture the full range of long-term outcomes.\"",
      "Although hormones can carry side effects, like any medicine, they can greatly improve the mental health of those with gender dysphoria, studies show.",
      "Ladinsky said hormone therapies are often used with older adolescents who have had sustained gender dysphoria over a long period of time.",
      "Hormone therapies \"are all used and have been used in pediatric and adolescent medicine, for a long, long, long time,\" she said. \"Any person who's ever used combination birth control pills has taken oral estrogen. So, it's not that these medicines are unique, experimental, pulled off a shelf. They're standard pharmacology in the practice of medicine.\"",
      "Controversy around surgeries",
      "The review said it found three studies on surgeries for children or adolescents with gender dysphoria \"with most considering mastectomy only.\"",
      "Gender-affirming mastectomy, known colloquially as \"top surgery,\" is a surgical procedure that removes breast tissue to create a more masculine-looking chest.",
      "The report said authors found low certainty of evidence on the effects of gender-affirming surgeries on adolescents including suicidality, depression, asexual function, quality of life and regret.",
      "Ladinsky said there are no gender-affirming genital surgeries that occur on minors and no other gender-affirming surgeries being performed on young children.",
      "\"There is a very small group of trans-masculine older teens, meaning 17-ish, 18, who -- in our evidence-based, guideline-driven standard of care -- does allow for a tiny group of these older trans-masculine teens with overwhelming and sustained gender dysphoria to have masculinizing chest surgery,\" she said.",
      "Ladinsky continued, \"That is very, very rare and that procedure can only be done with long periods of oversight around gender dysphoria with doctors, immense parental consent and professional endorsement by those caring for the young person.\"",
      "HHS advocates for psychotherapy",
      "The HHS report advocates for the use of psychotherapy as a treatment for children and adolescents with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Psychotherapy is a noninvasive alternative to endocrine and surgical interventions for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria,\" the report stated. \"Systematic reviews of evidence have found no evidence of adverse effects of psychotherapy in this context.\"",
      "Karasic said certain kinds of psychotherapy can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety and depression among both cisgender and transgender individuals, but psychotherapy should not be considered a substitute for gender-affirming care.",
      "\"There's absolutely no evidence that psychotherapy is a substitute for those people who need medical care,\" he told ABC News. \"There's substantial evidence for the benefits of [gender-affirming] care for minors, and that's why all mainstream medical and mental health groups support this versus no evidence of psychotherapy being a substitute.\"",
      "Karasic said psychotherapy is not bad, but rather that it has its place and, very often, children and teenagers receive psychotherapy along with medical intervention.",
      "\"If people are proposing the availability of therapy for people who need it, I think everyone would agree with that,\" he said. \"But when people are saying that medical intervention should not be provided because therapy can be used instead, that's wrong. There's just no evidence to support that.\"",
      "Response from the medical community",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement on Thursday saying it is \"deeply alarmed\" by the HHS report.",
      "\"For such an analysis to carry credibility, it must consider the totality of available data and the full spectrum of clinical outcomes rather than relying on select perspectives and a narrow set of data,\" the statement read in part. \"This report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\"",
      "AAP also released a statement with several groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Psychiatric Association, opposing an infringement on medical care.",
      "\"Our organizations have consistently opposed any legislation, regulation or executive action that interferes in the confidential relationship between a patient and their physician or undermines the provision of evidence-based standards of patient care and physician training and education,\" the statement, released on Thursday, read. \"Patients must must be able to discuss health issues with their trusted physician to determine together what care is best for them.\"",
      "More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced throughout the 2024 legislative session, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Ladinsky said these bills are harmful and they don't resolve gender dysphoria for anyone.",
      "\"If government-sanctioned, blatant misinformation is utilized to make policy decisions that affect millions of Americans, we are opening a Pandora's box to greatly diminish the health of all people, rather than elevating it,\" she said. \"The other thing important is that we know from 25 states that have rendered illegal elements of this care, it hasn't made any children of trans identity no longer trans.\"",

      "In the photo, taken by a Reuters photographer, the names of people Waltz had been texting included Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy.",
      "White House Communications Director Steven Cheung defended Waltz's use of the app on Thursday afternoon, saying, \"Signal is an approved app that is loaded onto our government phones. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"",
      "Waltz came under fire in March after he inadvertently invited a journalist, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal group chat with other national security officials, such as Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, where they discussed a U.S. attack on terrorists in Yemen.",
      "Waltz claimed he did not know how Goldberg got on the chat and claimed no sensitive information was shared. Trump defended Waltz and brushed off calls to fire him.",
      "On Thursday, Trump announced he would nominate Waltz to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim national security adviser while keeping his current role as well.",
      "Though Trump publicly backed Waltz, sources told ABC News that the president has been increasingly frustrated with him after he came under intense scrutiny over the Signal controversy.",
      "Despite the administration\u2019s position that Signal is an approved app, the Pentagon's internal watchdog criticized a former official's use of the Signal app in 2021, calling it a breach of the department's \"records retention policies\" and an unauthorized means of communicating sensitive information.",
      "Last month, DOD acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins announced he was starting an investigation into Hegseth's use of Signal during the Yemen attack. On Thursday a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that the IG was looking into a second Signal chat in which Hegseth shared timing for the attack with his wife, brother and attorney.",

      "President Donald Trump, celebrating the 100-day mark of his second term with his Cabinet, admitted his tariffs could mean higher prices for Americans, but appeared to dismiss the impact on American families, including on children's toys.",
      "\"You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open.' Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"You know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,\" the president continued. \"But, we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way.\"",
      "Trump went on to claim Americans didn't \"need\" many of the products that are imported from China, the world's second largest economy and the United States' third largest trading partner.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who joined press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a special briefing Thursday morning, argued Americans would be willing to pay more for American-made dolls.",
      "\"He was making the point that I think almost every American consumer agrees with, which is if they had a choice between a -- and I'm a parent of young children -- a choice between a doll from China that might have, say, lead paint in it, that is not as well constructed as a doll made in America, that has a higher environmental and regulatory standard, and that is made to a higher degree of quality, and those two products are both on Amazon that yes, you probably would be willing to pay more for a better made American product,\" Miller said.",
      "Trump's comments on dolls came a day after he pushed back on economic anxieties in an exclusive interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Hard times are ahead?\" ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran asked the president.",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Trump responded. \"I think great times are ahead.\"",
      "Trump's defended his tariff plan -- which includes product-specific levies on steel, aluminum and cars, a baseline 10% tariff on virtually all trade partners and a whopping $145% tariff on China -- as necessary to combat unfair trade deficits with other nations.",
      "He's also argued the taxes will bring a boost in manufacturing as companies will invest to make their products in America instead.",
      "But the administration's bumpy tariff rollout wiped away trillions in wealth as markets tumbled. Businesses continue to warn of possible price hikes and potential product shortages due to the levies. Trump said on Wednesday night, during a town hall with NewsNation, that he was in no rush to negotiate trade deals.",
      "Trump's message for Americans who may have concerns at the prospect of higher prices and other economic impacts was they voted for it -- despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail to bring down prices on Day 1 of his administration.",
      "\"With the economy, the number one issue for so many people, for just about everybody. It -- it's one of the main reasons that you're back in this office. And now we have this trade war with China that -- that Moody's and other analysts say is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, sayin', 'I didn't sign up for this.' So how do you answer those concerns?\" ABC's Moran asked Trump.",
      "\"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,\" Trump responded. \"I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before \u2026 I could've left it that way, and at some point, there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it.' I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.\"",

      "\"This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's,\" he posted on his conservative social media site. (In January 2024, when Biden was still president, Trump took credit for positive stock markets and cited poll numbers that showed him ahead of Biden).",

      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who has stayed largely out of the political limelight since leaving office, sharply criticized President Donald Trump \u2013 her opponent in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 over tariffs, government cuts, and the direction his administration is taking the country, during remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco.",
      "Her remarks, delivered at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office, came as the Trump administration celebrates its accomplishments in its first 100 days \u2013 a date Harris acknowledged.",
      "\"Now I know tonight's event happens to coincide with 100 days after the inauguration, and I'll leave it to others to give a full accounting of what's happened so far,\" Harris told the audience.",
      "\"But I will say this, instead of an administration working to advance America's highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,\" she said.",
      "Harris has had few public appearances since departing the White House and has limited her political activity, but on Wednesday night, she called out Trump by name.",
      "\"We all know President Trump, his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious. They are counting on the notion that, if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,\" Harris said.",
      "\"But what they're overlooking, what they've overlooked, is that fear isn't the only thing that's contagious. Courage is contagious,\" Harris said to raucous cheers.",
      "Harris had brought up similar themes \u2013 including the \"courage is contagious\" line \u2013 during remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April.",
      "That courage, Harris added on Wednesday, extends to Americans protesting against what she called \"the greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.\"",
      "\"Americans across the political spectrum who are declaring that the president's reckless tariffs hurt workers and families by raising the cost of everyday essentials; devastate the retirement accounts that people spent a lifetime paying into; and paralyze American businesses, large and small forcing them to lay off people, stop hiring, or pause investment decisions,\" she said.",
      "Trump and the White House have argued that tariffs will help Americans be better off economically in the long run and will level the playing field between the U.S. and its trading partners.",
      "Later in her remarks, speaking more broadly about the White House's actions, Harris said she would describe the current moment in America as a \"high-velocity event\" to implement an agenda she claimed was \"decades in the making\" to shrink and privatize government while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\"It's an agenda, a narrow self-serving vision of America, where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves, all while abandoning allies and retreating from the world,\" Harris said. \"And folks, what we are experiencing right now is exactly what they envision for America.\"",
      "Americans should be ready, if the \"checks and balances\" such as Congress \"ultimately collapse,\" Harris said, to work together and raise their voices.",
      "\"I am not here tonight to offer all the answers, but I am here to say this, you are not alone, and we are all in this together -- and straight talk, things are probably going to get worse before they get better, but we are ready for it. We are not going to scatter. We are going to stand together, everyone a leader,\" Harris said.",
      "At the end of her remarks, Harris struck a populist note: \"Always remember this country is ours. It doesn't belong to whoever is in the White House. It belongs to you. It belongs to us. It belongs to We The People.\"",
      "The former Democratic nominee for president has had few public appearances since departing the White House, and has limited her political activity.",
      "Harris' speech came as she is set to possibly re-enter politics in the coming months. Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.",
      "Some Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.",
      "Whether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.",
      "In remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"",
      "And in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us. The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"",
      "Harris and her spouse, Doug Emhoff, have been the target of recent actions by Trump.",
      "Trump issued a memo in March that revoked the security clearances and access to classified information of his previous presidential opponents -- Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris -- as well as more than a dozen former administration officials. On Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been dismissed from the board of trustees of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as the White House confirmed it had removed board members.",

For example, they say, giving half of the kids in a trial a placebo for the measles vaccine when an already proven vaccine exists would put those participants unnecessarily at risk for the virus.",
      "It remains unclear what HHS considers a \"new\" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines, which are updated on an annual basis to better protect against currently circulating strains.",
      "\"FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has indicated that significant updates to existing vaccines\u2014such as those addressing seasonal strain changes or antigenic drift\u2014may be considered 'new products' requiring additional clinical evaluation,\" the department spokesperson told ABC News.",
      "But the spokesperson indicated the yearly flu vaccine might not be affected by the policy, calling it \"tried and tested for more than 80 years.\"",
      "It appears, instead, that the policy could impact the rollout of future COVID vaccines, which are updated annually.",
      "When asked to elaborate on what the department considers a \"new\" vaccine, the spokesperson said that federal health agencies would follow the \"Gold Standard of Science\".",
      "Kennedy has long questioned the safety of vaccines and argued that placebo-based trials are needed to ensure vaccines aren't doing more harm than good.",
      "Even as thousands were dying during the COVID-19 public health emergency, COVID vaccines still underwent placebo-controlled studies with more than 100,000 volunteers from diverse populations. Experts say the practice is necessary to determine if a vaccine is not only effective, but also safe.",
      "Many childhood vaccines were originally tested with placebo trials. Others have been available for decades, providing data from millions of people showing those vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective.",
      "Once a vaccine for a disease is approved safe and effective, future versions of the shot are tested in clinical trials against the already approved shot. Clinical trials test whether the updated vaccines generate an immune response that's comparable to or better than previous versions of the vaccine.",
      "Even after vaccines are made available to the public, scientists continue to monitor them for safety. They also review any reports of side effects or reactions and share these facts with the public.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has dispatched Vice President JD Vance all over the world in the opening months of the administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- When JD Vance was running for vice president, he walked across an airport tarmac in Wisconsin one August day when his campaign travels happened to intersect those of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and approached Air Force Two. Besides wanting to take a poke at Republican Donald Trump's rival for avoiding the press, Vance said, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\u201d",
      "It's an aircraft he now knows well.",
      "In the opening months of Trump's term, Vice President Vance has traveled all over the globe \u2014 family in tow \u2014 to conduct top-level diplomacy for the administration, in addition to taking a number of domestic trips. His international forays have featured a mix of meetings with world leaders, sharply crafted speeches advancing U.S. policy, \u201csoft power\u201d appearances to build goodwill and family time at tourist sites along the way.",
      "Vance's trips have included a five-day trip to Europe in February, a hastily reorganized trek to Greenland in March and a tour of Italy and India in April that was notable for the vice president's brief meeting with Pope Francis the day before the pontiff died.",
      "In his first big moment on the world stage in February, Vance pressed Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d message at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris and spoke of maintaining U.S. dominance in the surging industry. From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "The deaths of at least six foreign nationals in a fiery van crash in eastern Idaho are a reminder that many visitors to two of the busiest U.S. national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and nearby areas come from around the world",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- The deaths of at least six Italian and Chinese tourists in a fiery van crash in Idaho near Yellowstone National Park are a reminder that the roads leading into the popular international destination can be as dangerous as the region\u2019s grizzly bears and boiling hot pools.",
      "The van collided with a pickup truck Thursday on a highway just west of Yellowstone. Both vehicles caught fire, and the survivors were taken to hospitals with injuries, according to police. The tourists who were killed were from Italy and China, officials said.",
      "The Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco said eight Chinese citizens were injured in the crash. The accident comes after a crash in 2019 of a bus from Las Vegas carrying Chinese tourists that rolled over near southern Utah\u2019s Bryce National Park, killing four people and injuring dozens more.",
      "Where the van in Thursday's accident was coming from and going was unknown. Some Yellowstone roads, including the one south of Old Faithful \u2014 the park's most famous geyser \u2014 were still closed after the snowy winter.",
      "The highway where the accident happened south of West Yellowstone, Montana, offers a way to get between Yellowstone and Grand Teton at this time of year, before a north-south route is plowed and the park fully opens for summer.",
      "According to the most recent data from the International Trade Administration, 36% of international visitors who arrived to the U.S. by air listed visits to national parks and national monuments as their top leisure activity while in the U.S.",
      "Seventeen percent of Yellowstone's visitors came from other countries in 2016, according to a park visitor use study with the most recent comprehensive data available.",
      "Visitors from Europe and Asia accounted for the majority of travelers from outside the U.S., with 34% from China, 11% from Italy and 10% from Canada.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic changed those numbers significantly, said Brian Riley whose Wyoming-based business, Old Hand Holdings, markets the Yellowstone region in China and runs tours.",
      "\u201cEvery Chinese is taught how great Yellowstone is in their elementary school,\u201d Riley said Friday.",
      "The pandemic put a sharp brake on tourism of all kinds but especially from China, which has yet to recover, Riley observed. Now, visits by people already living in the U.S. account for most visits by Chinese, he said.",
      "\u201cForeigners in general they don\u2019t feel safe over here like they did before,\u201d Riley said Friday. \u201cThe Chinese are kind of preaching that behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "The U.S. tourism industry expected 2025 to be another good year for foreign visitors. But several months in, international arrivals have been plummeting. Angered by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere.",
      "Riley, who grew up in Jackson, Wyoming, just south of Grand Teton and lived in China for a time to learn Mandarin and why Chinese wanted to visit the U.S., is more focused of late on getting them to visit Hawaii, a state perceived as less dangerous.",
      "Yellowstone's crowds peak in the summer, but international tourism peaks in spring and fall, according to Riley and West Yellowstone Mayor Jeff McBirnie.",
      "Many foreign visitors are parents of international students at U.S. colleges and universities.",
      "\u201cThey're like, 'Hey let's drop our kid off and go on vacation for a week.' Or kid's graduating, let's get them through college and go on vacation,'\u201d said McBirnie, who owns a pizza place in town. \u201cThey really bring a huge economic impact to this town.\u201d",
      "Yellowstone suffered a one-two punch between the pandemic and devastating floods in 2022 that cut off access to parts of the park for months.",
      "Tourism rebounded with 4.7 million visitors last year, Yellowstone's second-busiest on record.",
      "Winding roads and natural distractions help fuel numerous accidents in and around the park.",
      "The first death involving a passenger vehicle in Yellowstone came just a few years after the park was completely motorized and a fleet of buses replaced the stage coaches and horses used for transport in the park\u2019s early years.",
      "In 1921, a 10-passenger bus went off the road in the Fishing Bridge area of the park and down an embankment, killing a 38-year-old Texas woman when her neck was broken, according to park historian Lee Whittlesey.",
      "Whittlesey in his book \u201cDeaths in Yellowstone.\u201d chronicles deaths by all means \u2013- from drownings in hot springs, to bear maulings, airplane crashes and murders. Auto deaths, Whittlesey wrote, are \u201clegion\u201d in the park, to the point that he felt them too ordinary to include in his tally of fatalities.",
      "Another accounting of deaths in Yellowstone says at least 17 people died inside the park in motor vehicle crashes since 2007, ranking it the second most common cause of deaths behind medical issues.",
      "Whittlesey presaged the chapter of his book covering road deaths with a quote attributed to the 15th century soothsayer Mother Shipton: \u201cCarriages without horses shall go, And Accidents fill the world with woe.\u201d",

      "Gov. Ron DeSantis has had firm support from Florida's legislative body for six years",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- For six years, Gov. Ron DeSantis had a firm grasp on Florida's legislature. In his second-to-last legislative session, that is not the case.",
      "Top lawmakers once stood beside DeSantis on issues ranging from parental rights and DEI programs to abortion and gun rights. These padded DeSantis' national profile ahead of his unsuccessful presidential bid in 2024.",
      "This year, the Republican governor looked to enforce President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, remove state property taxes and address South Florida's condominium crisis. Instead, his influence dwindled as fellow Republicans publicly defied his directives and even raised questions about his handling of state agencies.",
      "The Legislature adjourned the legislative session late Friday without a budget prepared to be signed by DeSantis, who wields the power of the line-item veto to only approve specific appropriations in a budget package. Lawmakers extended the session until early June after announcing they have a framework for a budget. The governor would need to sign it before July 1, when the fiscal year begins.",
      "The opposition presents a whole new challenge for the term-limited governor who may have aspirations to run for president in 2028. And DeSantis has been amping up his rhetoric against legislators, labeling them the \u201cHouse of Pettiness.\u201d",
      "Here are some key issues that didn't necessarily go in DeSantis' favor:",
      "In January, Republican lawmakers opened and then immediately ended a special session called by DeSantis on Trump's immigration agenda. Determined to tackle the issue on their own terms, they then gaveled back in, tossed out the governor's proposals and presented their own.",
      "The rebuke to DeSantis would have been unthinkable in previous years.",
      "A weekslong standoff ended with the governor signing negotiated immigration measures, which went beyond Trump's executive orders by mandating the death penalty for immigrants without legal status who commit capital offences in Florida.",
      "A Florida House subcommittee began a probe of Hope Florida, an initiative by First Lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "Initially, it focused on a $10 million donation to the Hope Florida Foundation as part of a $67 million settlement between Centene Corporation, the state's largest Medicaid contractor, and a state agency.",
      "DeSantis had asked legislators to create a Hope Florida Office under the governor's oversight. This would have helped boost the first lady's key initiative ahead of the 2026 election, when she is expected to campaign to replace her husband as governor.",
      "Instead, DeSantis has spent weeks criticizing lawmakers' probes into the initiative, accusing lawmakers of drawing negative attention toward the initiative to \u201cattack the first lady.\u201d",
      "Rep. Alex Andrade, who chaired the state subcommittee, announced April 24 that the investigation had ended and he was \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d several parties were involved in a misuse of $10 million in Medicaid funds.",
      "In February, the governor recommended his own $115.6 billion budget proposal for lawmakers to consider.",
      "The proposal included key measures such as $505 million for immigration enforcement and $1.5 billion for Everglades restoration and water quality projects. It also had $2.2 billion in tax relief through some provisions like repealing business rent tax and providing more sales tax holidays.",
      "Yet the House and the Senate still haven't agreed on a budget. House Speaker Daniel Perez told lawmakers to expect to return in June to finalize budget approvals prior to the effective date in July.",
      "The House is seeking a smaller $113 billion budget, contrary to the Senate's $117.4 billion spending plan. One main provision in the House is a 0.75% cut to sales tax, which DeSantis has lambasted. He is instead pushing to roll back the state's property taxes. The Senate plan doesn't include that sales tax cut.",
      "Throughout April, DeSantis repeatedly criticized the House for disagreements on the budget, whether related to Everglades restoration, law enforcement funding or tax cuts.",
      "\u201cThey are the least-productive Florida House of Representatives that we have had in the modern history of the Florida Republican Party,\u201d DeSantis said in an April 16 press conference in Fort Myers.",
      "The initial special session for immigration in January also was meant to address condominium issues, since owners are facing hikes in property insurance rates and increased association costs. Instead, legislators focused on these provisions in the final weeks of session.",
      "A 2022 law passed after the Surfside condominium collapse means condo owners have faced higher costs because associations are legally required to have enough reserves for major repairs. The law also requires a survey of reserves every decade.",
      "This session, lawmakers aimed to relieve some of these cost hikes for condo owners, which mostly affect residents in South Florida and retirees on fixed incomes. The bill was sent to the governor Wednesday, allowing condo associations to fund reserves through lines of credit and give residents more flexibility to pause payments to their reserves while handling repairs and maintenance.",
      "In the weeks leading to the bill's passage, the House and Senate presented two different versions, with the House version widely criticized by the governor. In April, DeSantis said the House bill would allow people to be \u201cdriven out of their homes\u201d and \u201cpave the way for developers to make more money.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet's recognize that these consequences are not what we want, and let's provide reforms to be able to keep people in their condo units,\" DeSantis said of the House version.",

      "The University of California has announced that James B",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- James B. Milliken, who has led major public university systems in New York and Texas, was named president of the University of California on Friday.",
      "Milliken comes to the role from the University of Texas, where he has served as chancellor since 2018. He has also held leadership roles at The City University of New York, the University of Nebraska and the University of North Carolina.",
      "The UC system has 10 campuses, including Berkeley, Los Angeles and Davis. Milliken starts on Aug. 1. He will be paid nearly $1.5 million a year.",
      "\u201cThe University of California is universally regarded as the preeminent public research university in the world, and I am deeply honored to have an opportunity to join the many talented faculty, staff, and campus leaders in their vital work,\" Milliken said in a UC press release. \"It is more important than ever that we expand the education, research, health care, and public service for which UC is so widely admired and which has benefited so many Californians.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes at a time when the Trump administration is targeting federal funding at universities in an attempt to get them to comply with the Republican president\u2019s political agenda.",
      "The University of California, Berkeley, is among dozens of colleges under investigation by the U.S. Education Department over its ties to The PhD Project, a group aimed at diversifying the business world and higher education faculty. The Trump administration is also investigating Berkeley over allegations of antisemitism linked to pro-Palestinian protests against the war in Gaza that broke out last year across campuses nationwide.",
      "In response, Berkeley said it has \u201can unwavering commitment\u201d to fighting antisemitism.",
      "The Trump administration also launched probes into three University of California campuses over their admissions policies to determine whether they comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Milliken succeeds Michael V. Drake as UC president. Drake was the first Black person to serve in the role in the system\u2019s more than 150-year history. Drake announced last year that he would step down after serving as president since 2020, leading the system through the coronavirus pandemic, a graduate student strike and various campus protests.",
      "His announcement last July that he planned to step down followed a particularly tumultuous spring. Over several days last April and early May, counterprotesters attacked a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA that had grown on campus and law enforcement waited hours to step in. The next day, authorities in riot gear dispersed more than 1,000 people who had gathered to support the encampment.",
      "Drake said Milliken \u201chas the depth of wisdom and experience\u201d to deal with the challenges that come with leading one of the nation's largest public university systems.",
      "\u201cI have great confidence in both his leadership and his commitment to the University\u2019s enduring values,\" he said in a statement. \"I\u2019m excited about his appointment and look forward to seeing all that he will accomplish at the University.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that he was excited to see Milliken selected for the role to \u201cdrive the next chapter of innovation, talent, and progress that will shape California and the country for generations to come.\u201d",

      "\u201cImagine that! Professional #WOKE SJW confirms fake history for Ubisoft,\u201d one Reddit user said, using an acronym for \u201csocial justice warrior.\u201d Another user called her a \u201csexual degenerate who hate humanity because no man want her.\u201d",
      "Learning Yasuke was based on a real person did little to assuage critics. Asian men in particular argued Schmidt-Hori was trying to erase them, even though her role involved researching historical customs and reviewing scripts, not creating characters.",
      "\u201cI became the face of this backlash,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople wanted to look for who to yell at, and I was kind of there.\u201d",

      "\u201cI decided to cause \u2018good trouble,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI refused to ignore.\u201d",
      "Schmidt-Hori began replying to some of the angry emails, asking the senders why they were mad at her and inviting them to speak face-to-face via Zoom. She wrote to an influencer who opposes diversity, equity and inclusion principles and had written about her, asking him if he intended to inspire the death threats she was getting.",
      "\u201cIf somebody said to your wife what people are saying to me, you wouldn\u2019t like it, would you?\u201d she asked.",
      "The writer didn\u2019t reply, but he did take down the negative article about Schmidt-Hori. Others apologized.",
      "\u201cIt truly destroyed me knowing that you had to suffer and cancel your class and received hate from horrible people,\u201d one man wrote. \u201cI feel somehow that you are part of my family, and I regret it. I\u2019m sorry from the bottom of my heart.\u201d",
      "Anik Talukder, a 28-year-old south Asian man living in the United Kingdom, said he apologized at least 10 times to Schmidt-Hori after accepting her Zoom invitation to discuss his Reddit post about her.",
      "On May 16, feeling surprised and disappointed about Yasuke as a protagonist, he posted a screenshot that included photos of Schmidt-Hori, her professional biography from the Dartmouth website and a description of a book she wrote.",
      "\u201cI felt like maybe they were doing too much of like racial inclusion and changing things,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAn Asian male could have been the role model for so many people.\u201d",

      "He was shocked the professor reached out to him and hesitant to speak to her at first. But they ended up having a thoughtful conversation about the lack of Asian representation in Western media and have stayed in touch ever since.",
      "\u201cI learned a massive lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made this person a target for no reason whatsoever.\u201d",
      "Ubisoft officials declined to be interviewed about the criticism of the game or the harassment Schmidt-Hori faced. In a statement, the company said it carefully researches historical settings and collaborates with internal and expert witnesses, but the games remain works of fiction and artistic liberties are taken.",
      "\u201cWe do not condone harassment or bullying in any form,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are committed to creating a supportive and collaborative environment and we\u2019re constantly learning how we can improve this process. We commend and appreciate Sachi Schmidt-Hori for addressing these topics directly and are grateful for her approach and expertise.\u201d",
      "Unlike the professor at Dartmouth, in Hanover, New Hampshire, most people who become the target of online hate end up retreating to protect themselves, said Kate Mays, an assistant professor of public communication at the University of Vermont.",

      "The trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is set to begin in a New York courtroom",
      "NEW YORK -- Hip-hop impresario Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs once presided like a prince over his White Parties in the Hamptons, attracting A-list celebrities, gossip columnists and photographers. But at a trial starting Monday, prosecutors will cast the entertainer as a criminal sexual deviant who exploited his fame to abuse women at gatherings held far out of public view.",
      "For over two decades, prosecutors allege, the Bad Boy Records founder used the power and prestige he\u2019d gained in building a hip-hop empire to destroy young lives.",
      "He faces an indictment that includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "Numerous witnesses have come forward to accuse Combs of terrorizing people into silence by choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair, prosecutors say. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs' lawyers contend prosecutors are trying to police consensual sexual activity.",
      "And while Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence \u2014 the caught-on-camera beating of his former girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie \u2014 his lawyers say other allegations are false.",
      "Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday at a federal courthouse in Manhattan. Testimony will likely start the following week.",
      "If convicted on all charges, which include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transporting people across state lines to engage in prostitution, Combs faces a possible sentence of decades in prison.",
      "Although dozens of men and women have alleged in lawsuits that Combs abused them, this trial will highlight the claims of four women.",
      "One of them is Cassie, who filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape after they met in 2005.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, did.",
      "Her lawsuit, which offered the first public account of the Freak Offs described in the indictment, was settled in a day. Four months later, though, federal investigators raided Combs homes in Los Angeles and Miami and confronted him at a private airport in Florida, seizing 96 electronic devices. They also found three AR-15-style rifles with defaced serial numbers.",
      "The three-time Grammy winner was indicted last September. He has since been held in a federal jail in Brooklyn after judges ruled that he would be a threat to intimidate witnesses and victims if released.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs accuses him of using employees of his business endeavors \u2014 including record labels, a recording studio, an apparel line, an alcoholic spirits company, a marketing agency, a television network and a media company \u2014 to facilitate his crimes through acts that included kidnapping, arson and bribery.",
      "Prosecutors plan to show jurors travel records, text messages and emails, hotel records and videos to supplement testimony and support their claims about what they call \u201cFreak Off activity.\u201d",
      "Jurors will also see security camera video showing Combs punching, kicking and then dragging Cassie in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.",
      "After the video aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\"",
      "Combs' attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said at a bail hearing that Combs wrote \u201ca very large check\u201d to Cassie after she filed her lawsuit. The lawyer said the payout motivated others to come forward with false claims.",
      "Agnifilo said Combs was \u201cnot a perfect person\u201d and that there had been drug use and toxic relationships, but he said the rapper was undergoing therapy before his arrest.",
      "He said Cassie and Combs were in a 10-year relationship that was \u201cvery loving at times\u201d and sometimes chose to bring a third person into their intimacy.",
      "\u201cThat was their thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a sought-after, special part of their relationship.\u201d",
      "The trial is not Combs\u2019 first. In 2001, he was acquitted of bringing an illegal handgun into a crowded Manhattan dance club where three people were wounded by gunfire. A rapper in Combs\u2019 entourage, Jamal Barrow, who performed under the name Shyne, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "At a pretrial conference Thursday, Combs confirmed to a judge that he turned down a plea offer that would have carried a lesser penalty than what he might face if he is convicted at his upcoming trial.",
      "Just before he left the courtroom after the hearing, he defiantly shook his fist in the air.",

      "It didn't begin a long time ago or in a galaxy far far away, but every May 4 it feels like images, memes and promotional deals involving \u201cStar Wars\u201d have an inescapable gravity.",
      "May 4 \u2014 or May the 4th, as fans say \u2014 has evolved over the years into Star Wars Day, an informal holiday celebrating the space epic and its surrounding franchise.",

      "It's not an official holiday but has become so well-known that even former President Joe Biden marked it last year when \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor Mark Hamill dropped by the White House a day beforehand.",

      "The phrase \u201cMay the 4th be with you\u201d was used by fans in the years after the first film was released in 1977, and even appeared in a British political ad in 1979 celebrating Margaret Thatcher's victory as prime minister on May 4 that year.",
      "For some fans, the official Star Wars Day comes on May 25, the date of the first film's release. The Los Angeles City Council even declared the date to be Star Wars Day in 2007, although the California Legislature voted in 2019 to designate May 4 as Star Wars Day.",
      "May the 4th caught on informally among fans through inside jokes shared on social media and viewings of the films to mark the occasion. Businesses eventually joined in on the fun, with brands ranging from Nissan to Jameson Whiskey running ads or posting on social media about it.",
      "Disney, which acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, embraced the day as a way to further promote the franchise with merchandise, special screenings and other events surrounding the brand.",
      "Not all \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans are enthused about how ubiquitous the once-underground joke has become. Chris Taylor, a senior editor at Mashable and author of \u201cHow Star Wars Conquered the Universe,\u201d labels himself a \u201cMay the 4th grinch\" in part because of its commercialization.",
      "\u201cI love a good dad joke as much as anyone, but my God you can take it too far,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "The day is being celebrated on a large and small scale this year. Disney+ is launching the new series \u201cStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\u201d on the date, and it comes as the second season gets underway for another franchise series, \u201cAndor.\u201d",
      "It also follows the announcement that a new stand-alone \u201cStar Wars\u201d film installment starring Ryan Gosling will be released in 2027.",
      "Disney marks the day with the launch of new \u201cStar Wars\u201d merchandise, ranging from lightsaber sets to jewelry.",
      "Most Major League Baseball teams have marked the day in recent years with special events incorporating \u201cStar Wars\u201d characters. For example, the San Francisco Giants sold special tickets for Saturday's game that included a bobblehead portraying pitcher Logan Webb as \u201cObi-Webb Kenobi.\u201d",
      "It's hard to find a place where May the 4th celebrations aren't occurring, from bakeries serving cookies with a \u201cStar Wars\u201d theme to concerts featuring the memorable scores of the films.",
      "It's a town-wide celebration in New Hope, Pennsylvania, which shares its name with the subtitle of the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d film. The town of about 2,600 people, located 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Philadelphia, plans to have costumed characters throughout town with restaurants serving themed items like a \u201cYodaRita.\u201d",

Besides shops offering original artwork, the Village is home to Betsy, a 30-foot-tall, 40-foot-long (9-meter-tall, 12-meter-long) sculpture of a Florida Keys spiny lobster.",
      "Sande Keil, who owns Rain Barrel Village with her husband, said the Keys became part of her family\u2019s heartbeat after the Miami couple bought a vacation home on Islamorada in 1978.",
      "\u201cWhen the Rain Barrel Village came up for sale in 2007, I didn\u2019t see a business. I saw a way to continue our story in the Keys,\u201d Keil said. \u201cThe Village already had a soul. I just knew it needed someone to preserve it and to help grow it.\u201d",
      "Named after the large cisterns that once provided drinking water to the Keys, Rain Barrel Village isn\u2019t just about selling souvenirs, it is about supporting a community, Keil said. As an artist herself, Keil is proud to support other artists, artisans and small business owners and give them a space where they also can build something real.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve poured love, hard work and intention into the Rain Barrel,\u201d Keil said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created something that reflects who we are.\u201d",

      "Artist Richard Blaze completed Betsy in 1985. The fiberglass statue originally was commissioned for a local restaurant, but the business had closed by the time Betsy was done. The giant lobster was placed at another Islamorada attraction, Treasure Village, but she ended up in storage after the location became a charter school.

      "International students in the U.S. are reconsidering their travel plans this summer after a wave of student status terminations and visa revocations",
      "On summer break from a Ph.D. program, an international student at University of California, San Diego, was planning a trip with a few friends to Hawaii. But after seeing international students across the United States stripped of their legal status, the student decided against it.",
      "Any travel, even inside the U.S., just didn't seem worth the risk.",
      "\u201cI probably am going to skip that to ... have as few interactions with governments as possible,\" said the student, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of being targeted.",
      "International students weighing travel to see family, take a vacation or conduct research are thinking twice because of the Trump administration's crackdown, which has added to a sense of vulnerability.",
      "Even before students suddenly began losing permission to study in the U.S., some colleges were encouraging international students and faculty to postpone travel, citing government efforts to deport students involved in pro-Palestinian activism. As the scale of the status terminations emerged in recent weeks, more schools have cautioned against non-essential travel abroad for international students.",
      "University of California, Berkeley, for one, issued an advisory last week saying upcoming international travel was risky due to \u201cstrict vetting and enforcement.\u201d",
      "At least 1,220 students at 187 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records.",
      "The number of affected students appears far higher, though. At least 4,736 international students\u2019 visa records were terminated in a government database that maintains their legal status, according to an April 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement response to inquiries from Congress.",
      "Suddenly at risk for deportation, some students went into hiding while others left the country on their own. Many of the students said they had only minor infractions on their records or didn't know why their records were removed.",
      "After federal judges raised due process concerns in several students' cases, the U.S. government reversed the terminations but then issued new guidance expanding the reasons international students can lose their legal status in the future.",
      "Under the new policy, valid reasons for status termination include the revocation of the visas students used to enter the U.S. In the past, if a student\u2019s visa was revoked, they generally could stay in the U.S. to finish school. They simply would not be able to reenter if they left the country.",
      "The fast-evolving situation has left colleges struggling to advise students.",
      "A Michigan college employee who helps international students navigate the visa process said they are inquiring more than ever about summer travel. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said he often has been unable to give sufficient answers.",
      "Last year, the U.S. hosted around 1.1 million international students, a source of essential tuition revenue at many schools. Advocates say that number is likely to shrink as the crackdown hurts America's appeal.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Rishi Oza's immigration law firm in North Carolina has received calls about travel risks almost daily from people of varied immigration status, including international students.",
      "\u201cYou kind of shake your head and say, \u2018Is this the character of the country we want?'\u201d Oza said. \u201cIt just seems that it\u2019s a bit out of whack that people are fearful of leaving and whether they'll be able to come back.\u201d",
      "Students in the U.S. with a visa need to decide if their travels are critical, Oza said.",
      "When attempting reentry after leaving the country, they should bring immigration documents, school transcripts and even court documents if they were charged with a crime and the court dismissed the case. Ultimately, lawyers can't foretell what will happen at the airport, he said.",
      "The unpredictability has put one international student at the University of Illinois in distress. The student, who requested anonymity to avoid being targeted, has laid low since one of his classmates left the country after their legal status was terminated.",
      "The student's plan to travel to his home country in Asia this summer causes feelings of panic, but he has nowhere else to stay. He bought his plane ticket and is committed to the trip. His anxiety over what could happen when he returns, however, is still there.",
      "\u201cRight now,\" he said, \u201cI'm afraid I might not be able to come back.\u201d ___",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- After Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, North Carolina, the sound coming from open car windows as residents gathered on a street at the top of a ridge trying to get cell service last fall was Blue Ridge Public Radio. And as they stood in line for water or food, the latest news they'd heard on the station was a frequent topic of conversation.",
      "\u201cThe public radio station was alerting people what was going on,\u201d said Lisa Savage, who volunteered at an area church after the hurricane.",
      "Now public radio stations are being targeted for cuts by President Donald Trump. This week, he signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to NPR and PBS, alleging \u201cbias\u201d in the broadcasters\u2019 reporting.",
      "Public radio stations have been a lifeline for residents during natural disasters that take out power, the internet and cell towers. And in many remote and rural areas across the U.S., they can be a lone source of local news.",
      "About a week after she'd volunteered in the Asheville area, Savage recalled driving through another hard-hit community and hearing updates on Blue Ridge Public Radio on where residents could pick up water.",
      "\"So that was crucial,\u201d Savage said.",
      "In the West Texas desert, Marfa Public Radio provides listeners with a mix of local and national news and music. It\u2019s based in Marfa, a city of about 2,000 that draws tourists to its art scene.",
      "\u201cMarfa Public Radio is the only radio service in a lot of the geographic area that we cover,\u201d said Tom Livingston, the station\u2019s interim executive director. \u201cSo it\u2019s really essential in terms of if there\u2019s news events, if there\u2019s safety things that happen in the community.\u201d",
      "Trump's order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies \u201cto cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS\u201d and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. The broadcasters get roughly half a billion dollars in public money through the private CPB, which has said that it is not a federal executive agency subject to Trump\u2019s orders.",
      "The heads of PBS, NPR and CPB all suggested Friday that the order was illegal, and a court fight seems inevitable.",
      "The White House has also said it will be asking Congress to rescind funding for the CPB as part of a $9.1 billion package of cuts. Local stations operate on a combination of government funding, donations and philanthropic grants, and stations in smaller markets are particularly dependent on the public money.",
      "WMMT, based in the eastern Kentucky community of Whitesburg, can be heard in parts of five Appalachian states. The station\u2019s general manager, Teddy Wimer, said listeners \u201cwant to hear people that sound like folks that they know from Appalachia,\u201d and the station, which currently operates from a renovated Winnebago called the Possum Den, relies on CPB funding.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in an economically disadvantaged area of the country,\u201d Wimer said. \u201cMost of our listeners who really rely upon our programming don\u2019t have the funds to ramp up their support.\u201d",
      "Livingston said about 30% of their funding comes from the CPB. Right now, he says, it\u2019s too early to know if the cuts will actually happen or what they would impact if they do come through.",
      "Along the West Virginia-Virginia border, more than three hours from Washington, D.C., residents can pick up signals from radio stations far away. But those \u201caren\u2019t going have the local flavor and impact that we do,\u201d said Scott Smith, general manager of Allegheny Mountain Radio. \u201cThis is the only game in town for that sort of thing.\u201d",
      "In his home base of Monterey, Virginia, Smith said there\u2019s about a 4 -square-mile (10.3-square-kilometer) area of cell coverage with one cell tower. The station has proven to be a vital source of information during natural disasters. In 2012, residents relied on it after a derecho knocked out power to 680,000 customers across West Virginia and it took nearly two weeks for some areas to get their service restored.",
      "\u201cYeah, we play music. Yeah, we get on the air and joke around,\" he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here providing basic level services of information, emergency information, that sort of thing, to our communities. And as part of that, we\u2019re a pretty critical link in this area for the emergency alert system.\u201d",
      "Smith, who has a staff of 10 people, said 68% of Allegheny Mountain Radio\u2019s annual budget comes from CPB.",
      "\u201cWhat CPB does fund the most is small rural radio,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen you take 60% of our income away, that\u2019s not readily or easily replaceable.\u201d",
      "Smith calls it a \u201cwait-and-see game\u201d on whether Congress will act on the CPB funding.",
      "\u201cThe answer to how we move forward is vague,\" Smith said. \"We will still continue to be here as long as we can be.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump wants to tap into \u201cbeautiful, clean coal\" to help meet the electricity demands of what he bills as a new dawn of manufacturing and technological advancement in the United States",
      "JOSEPH CITY, Ariz. -- Brantley Baird never misses a chance to talk history, from how his great-grandmother helped settle the town of Snowflake long before Arizona was granted statehood to tales of riding to school bareback and tethering his horse outside the one-room schoolhouse.",
      "His family worked the land and raised livestock, watching the railroad come and go and cattle empires rise and fall. Then came the coal-fired power plants, built throughout northern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to power progress in distant Western cities.",
      "The plants would play their own role in the history of the region and could wind up at the center of its uncertain future.",
      "The Cholla Power Plant stands just down the road from where Baird, 88, has been building a museum to showcase covered wagons, weathered farm implements and other remnants of frontier days. For years the plant powered the local economy, providing jobs and tax revenues for the unincorporated community of Joseph City, its schools and neighboring towns, but now the vapors from its stacks have dissipated.",
      "These days, change is in the air. Cholla is the latest in a long line of U.S. coal-fired plants to retire, shutting down in March. Arizona Public Service said it had become too costly to operate due to strict environmental regulations. The mandates were aimed at reining in coal-burning utilities, long viewed by scientists as major contributors to warming the planet.",
      "Last month, however, President Donald Trump reversed course, signing new executive orders aimed at restoring \u201c beautiful, clean coal \u201d to the forefront of U.S. energy supplies. He urged his administration to find ways to reopen Cholla and delay the planned retirements of others. As part of his push toward energy independence, Trump has pledged to tap domestic sources \u2014 coal included \u2014 to fuel a new wave of domestic manufacturing and technology, namely innovations in artificial intelligence.",
      "In the West, where the vision of far-off politicians sometimes crashes against reality, Baird and many of his neighbors were encouraged that Trump put Cholla in the spotlight, but there's some skepticism about what the utilities will do with the plants.",
      "\u201cAs many jobs as it gives people, as much help just to our school district right here that we get out of there, we\u2019re hoping that it will come back, too,\u201d said Baird, who used to work at the Cholla plant and has served on the Joseph City School Board.",
      "Yet, he and others wonder if it's too late for coal.",
      "Just weeks before Trump announced his plans, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected a 65% increase in retirements of coal-fired generation in 2025 compared with last year.",
      "The largest plant on that list is the 1,800-megawatt Intermountain Power Project in Utah. It\u2019s being replaced by a plant capable of burning natural gas and hydrogen.",
      "Utilities, already looking to increase capacity, aren't sure Trump's orders will lead them back to coal.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that those plants that are scheduled or slated to retire are probably still going to move in that direction, for a couple of reasons,\" said Todd Snitchler, CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents power plant owners. \"One of which is it\u2019s very difficult to plan multimillion- or billion-dollar investments for environmental retrofits and other things on an executive order versus a legislative approach.\u201d",
      "Last month, Republicans in the Arizona Legislature sent a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warning that the economic fallout from the 2019 closure of the Navajo Generating Station is still reverberating. The stacks were demolished, and the mine that supplied the plant closed.",
      "At the San Juan Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico, operations ended in 2022.",
      "Stuck in the middle are Joseph City and other communities where life revolves around a power plant. Residents hope Trump can help keep them in the energy race for another generation. From Joseph City to Springerville, they've been preparing to absorb major hits to the job market, tax rolls and school enrollment. Options are slim in Apache and Navajo counties \u2014 two of Arizona\u2019s poorest.",
      "Utility executives told Arizona regulators recently that reopening Cholla would be costly for customers and that they plan to push ahead with renewable energy. The plant\u2019s infrastructure would be preserved as a possible site for future nuclear or gas-fired power generation, and the Springerville Generating Station could be repurposed once the last units are retired in 2032.",
      "The utility that runs the coal-fired Coronado Generating Station, just 30 miles (48 kilometers) away in St. Johns, also has plans to convert to natural gas.",
      "In Springerville, the idea of spoiling the surrounding grasslands and ancient volcanic fields with 112 wind turbines \u2014 with blades standing taller than Seattle's Space Needle \u2014 provokes outrage. Banners and posters objecting to the proposal are plastered around town.",
      "\u201cThey all know that this won\u2019t work, that we can\u2019t rely on wind and solar,\u201d said Doug Henderson, a Springerville plant retiree who now sits on the town council. He says coal-fired generation can accommodate swings in demand, regardless of whether there\u2019s sunshine or wind.",
      "Springerville Mayor Shelly Reidhead and others are fighting to keep the wind farm from happening, saying repurposing the Springerville coal plant would mean more jobs and preserve the surrounding landscape.",
      "\u201cWe also survive on tourism and people don't want to come here and look at that,\u201d Reidhead said of the turbines.",
      "The Western Drug and General Store is adorned with tiny American flags tacked up outside. A sign advertises canning supplies, but locals joke that you can get anything here \u2014 from slippers to rifles.",
      "Andrea Hobson works the register and knows everyone by name. She moved to Springerville about 20 years ago from California and says it's hard to imagine the community without the power plant.",
      "\u201cIt would be a ghost town. It really would,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the heart of this town.\u201d",
      "Springerville\u2019s leaders have lost sleep trying to figure out what industries might fill the void. At stake are about 350 jobs, dozens of contract employees and the businesses they support \u2014 from the general store and the new frozen yogurt shop to the hospital and local churches.",
      "Some workers drive an hour to the Springerville plant every day, meaning other communities also will lose out, said Randel Penrod, a former crew manager at the plant. With retirement looming, the plant has trimmed its workforce.",
      "Henderson, the Springerville town council member, fears it could take years to permit a new plant.",
      "Reidhead is more hopeful after attending meetings with members of Arizona\u2019s congressional delegation and utility executives. She thinks the Trump administration can reduce the \u201cred tape\u201d and get new plants up and running. The development of artificial intelligence and its thirst for power gives the mission a sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cI think our politicians at a state level have realized with AI\u2019s need for the power, that if we don\u2019t get on board and get on board soon we\u2019re going to be left behind,\u201d she said.",
      "Some energy analysts say Trump\u2019s support of coal is mostly symbolic, since utilities hold the keys. Others say diversifying energy sources is a must as the U.S. sees increases in power demand predicted for the first time in decades.",
      "\u201cAI may be artificial, but the electricity it needs is very real \u2014 and in some regions, coal still keeps the lights on when other sources may blink,\u201d said Scott Segal, a partner with the Washington D.C.-based firm Bracewell LLP.",
      "He said power markets don\u2019t care about politics \u2014 just reliability, affordability and sustainability.",
      "Just outside of Joseph City, crews are building what will be one of the largest solar and battery storage projects in Arizona. The solar panels will be installed on leased private land, including Baird\u2019s sprawling ranch.",
      "While not a fan of all the dust being kicked up, Baird knows the advent of solar is just another of many changes he has seen in his lifetime \u2014 and he has no idea what the next 100 years might look like.",
      "\u201cHell, who knows?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, when it comes right down to it, we\u2019ll just wait and see.\u201d",

      "Kordia, 32, was among the earliest people jailed in President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on noncitizens who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "She was detained during a voluntary check-in with immigration officials in Newark, New Jersey, on March 13, then flown to an immigration jail in Texas. Her arrest was announced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security the next day in a statement that cited an expired visa and her role in \u201cpro-Hamas protests.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear how immigration authorities were able to learn about Kordia's presence at the protest near Columbia last April. At the demonstration, police cited Kordia with disorderly conduct. But the charge was dismissed weeks later and the case sealed.",
      "City law generally prohibits police from sharing information about arrests with federal immigration officials, although there are exceptions for criminal investigations.",
      "On March 14, an NYPD officer generated a four-page report on Kordia and shared it with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.",
      "In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson said the department \u201creceived a request from a federal agency related to a criminal investigation and shared relevant information in accordance with our sanctuary city policies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe NYPD does not participate in programs that are designed for visa revocation or any civil immigration matter,\u201d the statement added.",
      "The department declined to say what the investigation entailed.",
      "Inquiries to the DHS and ICE were not returned.",
      "Legal experts and civil liberties advocates said the document reflected a worrisome level of information-sharing between the city and the federal government, which has conflated criticism of Israel with support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group.",
      "\u201cThe intention of the sanctuary laws is to protect against this kind of collusion and pretextual information sharing,\u201d said Meghna Philip, the director of special litigation at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "\u201cIt seems to be a clear violation of the law,\u201d Philip added, \u201cand raises questions about what guardrails, if any, the NYPD has around sharing information with a federal government that is seeking to criminalize speech.\u201d",
      "Kordia grew up in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and moved to New Jersey in 2016 with her mother, an American citizen. She studied English at a local exchange program, but let her student visa expire because she believed her application for permanent residency was sufficient to remain in the country legally, according to her attorneys.",
      "Kordia\u2019s case stood out among those ensnared by Trump\u2019s crackdown. She was not an outspoken activist and had not publicly criticized Israel, either in social media posts or newspaper op-eds. She maintained no social media presence and did not appear on any of the public lists maintained by pro-Israel groups that seek to identify people who participate in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Her name was not mentioned in news reports about the demonstrations.",
      "While the Trump administration identified her as a Columbia student, she has never been affiliated with the university and was not enrolled in any college when she joined a protest in 2024 outside Columbia. Her attorneys said she was peacefully voicing her dissent against Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which they said has killed over 100 of her relatives.",
      "A spokesperson for the NYPD declined to say when they were first approached by federal authorities or whether the March 14 report was the first time they had shared information about Kordia's arrest record.",
      "Beginning in early March, attorneys for Kordia say federal agents began interrogating members of her family and her neighbors. They also subpoenaed records from her MoneyGram account and \u201cestablished a trace on her WhatsApp messaging account,\u201d her attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\u201cThe investigation revealed nothing except that Ms. Kordia sent a single payment to a Palestinian family member in 2022, which itself is protected First Amendment\" rights, the filing states.",
      "At an April 3rd hearing, the federal government pointed to Kordia\u2019s prior arrest for protesting as a reason she should not be released. An immigration judge found no evidence she had acted violently at the protest and agreed to grant Kordia a $20,000 bond, which her family paid.",
      "The government has appealed that decision, keeping her detained for now.",
      "In a petition seeking her release, attorneys for Kordia, a devout Muslim, said she had been denied halal meals since arriving at the jail. As a result, she has lost 49 pounds (22 kilograms) and fainted in the shower, according to facility records shared with her attorneys.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s entire argument that Ms. Kordia is a danger to the United States rests on a single summons for her participation in a demonstration,\u201d Arthur Ago, her attorney, said. \u201cThe only reason she\u2019s confined right now is because of her political viewpoint.\u201d",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has criticized the city\u2019s sanctuary protections, while insisting his administration is \u201cmeticulously\u201d following the law.",
      "When asked by the AP last month if the NYPD could turn over information to its federal law enforcement partners about a summons issued to a protester, the mayor insisted no such request was ever made.",
      "\u201cWe have no record that this happened,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWhen I inquired, they said we did not turn over anything and we don\u2019t collaborate for civil enforcement. They said that over and over again.\u201d",
      "His office did not respond to inquiries Friday.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration apparently has backed away from a proposal to eliminate funding for Head Start",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration apparently has backed away from a proposal to eliminate funding for Head Start, the early education program that serves some of the nation\u2019s neediest preschoolers.",
      "Backers of the six-decade-old program, which educates more than half a million children from low-income and homeless families, had been fretting after a leaked Trump administration proposal suggested defunding it. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation and co-authored by President Donald Trump\u2019s current budget chief, also called for cutting Head Start.",
      "But the budget summary released Friday, which outlined programs set to receive drastic cuts or boosts, did not mention Head Start. On a call with reporters, an administration official said there would be \u201cno changes\u201d to it. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the budget plan on a call with reporters.",
      "Still, teachers, families and advocates remain concerned about the stability of Head Start. The Trump administration is closing several regional offices and laying off the staff who support the program, which has led to funding delays that threatened to close individual preschools. A document accidentally emailed to grant recipients this week called for eliminating funding for research on Head Start and other child care programs. And before Trump took office, staffing shortages and rising costs had forced some programs to cut the number of students they served, or shutter altogether.",
      "Advocates say other cuts to education and social-safety-net programs would also hurt families served by Head Start.",
      "\u201cWhile Head Start is grateful that it was not explicitly eliminated in this skinny budget proposal, we are concerned about the significant cuts that threaten access to health services, education, and support for hundreds of thousands of families,\u201d said Yasmina Vinci, executive director for the National Head Start Association, in a statement.",

      "The backcountry sport of burro racing is a grueling feat of endurance that tests the sudden urge to stand still",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Backcountry runners are embracing the physical and emotional challenge of racing with pack burros that don't always move at their pace.",
      "Burro races honor Old West history and hinge on a delicate partnership between runner and beast of burden. Burros, a Spanish-derived word for donkeys and their wild cousins, must carry a saddle, pick, pan and shovel in homage to a bygone era and the mythical sprint by miners to a land claims office with their pack animal.",
      "Some 70 teams will test their skills Saturday in a race winding through the historic, turquoise-mining town of Cerrillos in northern New Mexico. Runners will lead burros by rope on a 6-mile (10-kilometer) or 3-mile (5-kilometer) course on unpaved roads and single-track desert trails.",
      "More ambitious burro races in Colorado can extend for nearly 30 miles (48 kilometers).",
      "Racers often buy or inherit burros from owners who run out of money, time or patience. Others adopt burros that were corralled by the federal government to prevent overpopulation. Novices easily can rent an ass to try it out for kicks.",
      "The race in Cerrillos, which provided the rugged backdrop in the 1980s Western \"Young Guns,\" starts with a madcap sprint as competitive teams gallop to the front of the pack, and other burros instinctively attempt to keep pace.",
      "Runners can\u2019t ride the burro but can push, pull and coax the animal as long as they don't abuse it. Some racers swing a rope in circles \u2014 like a lasso \u2014 to encourage movement. Others on the trail cry out, \u201cHup, hup!\u201d",
      "Joe Polonsky of Monument, Colorado, took up burro racing in 2018. He described himself as a mediocre ultramarathon runner, but in burro racing he's a top contender.",
      "\u201cI am fortunate because Jake does like to be up front at the start of the race,\u201d Polonsky said about his four-legged partner. \u201cSo I will let him pull me.\u201d",
      "Burros wear a halter, which is less restrictive than a horse's bridle and bit, attached to a 15-foot (4.5-meter) rope held by the runner. Some racers tether the rope to their waist and draft off the burro.",
      "A burro race can devolve into a contest of wills when the animals get defiant and won\u2019t budge.",
      "But experienced racers say that doesn't mean the donkeys are being stubborn. They're smart and naturally curious animals. When they sense danger, discomfort or the unknown, they will lock down in place, unlike horses that quickly flee.",
      "\u201dIf something scares them and they're nervous, they\u2019re going to just stop and assess the situation,\" Polonsky said.",
      "Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high \u201cminis\u201d that may weigh 300 pounds (135 kilograms) to bulky \u201cmammoths.\u201d Burros first appeared in the region more than 400 years ago, led from Mexico City by Spanish settlers and Catholic friars.",
      "For those who rent or borrow a burro for the race, they are encouraged to show up early or even the night before to get acquainted with their racing buddy, not unlike a blind date, said Lisa Kazmar, a massage therapist from Edgewood, New Mexico, who owns four burros with names taken from Harry Potter novels.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the new donkey is going to do, it can be very scary,\u201d Kazmar said.",
      "Burro racing emerged shortly after World War II in depopulated Colorado mining towns and now is an official state-heritage sport with marquee races in Leadville, Buena Vista and Fairplay that blend county-fair cheer and athleticism.",
      "The pun-loving Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation manages the modern race circuit that extends from the Tombstone Donkey Dash in Arizona to a Weekend at Burney race in Cassel, California, and a new \u201cburro stampede\u201d this year in the Magdalena Mountains of New Mexico. Tennessee got in on the action five years ago with a race held annually in April.",
      "Race and team sponsors include veterinary clinics, as well as brands selling sneakers, hydration drinks and beef jerky.",
      "At Cerrillos, the teams compete for Western belt-buckle trophies, including a \u201clast ass\u201d award for the final finisher.",
      "Success in racing doesn't come easy, according to Shane Weigand of Edgewood, New Mexico, a construction manager, burro race organizer and backcountry outfitter for burro-pack trips and \u201ctequila-burro\u201d weddings.",
      "\u201cYou have to spend a lot of time on the trail with your burro, building up that relationship and trust,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- The deadline to get a REAL ID is fast approaching after years of postponements and delays.",
      "Starting May 7, your license or identification card will need to be REAL ID-compliant to fly domestically in the U.S.",
      "Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like there will be another delay in the deadline this time. So, if you\u2019re confused about how to get a REAL ID, why you even need one in the first place, and what happens if you don\u2019t have one by May 7, here are some things to know:",
      "It\u2019s a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that the DHS says is a more secure form of identification. Besides needing a REAL ID to fly domestically, you will also need one to access certain federal buildings and facilities.",
      "When the REAL ID Act was signed into law in 2005, it enacted a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission that the government set security standards for state-issued driver\u2019s licenses and IDs.",
      "\u201cREAL ID is a coordinated effort by the federal government to improve the reliability and accuracy of driver\u2019s licenses and identification cards,\u201d John Essig, the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s Security Director for airports in the New York City region said in a press release on April 3. \u201cThe improvements are intended to inhibit terrorists\u2019 ability to evade detection by using fraudulent identification.\u201d",
      "The REAL ID Act was supposed to begin rolling out in 2008, \u201cbut has faced repeated delays due to state implementation challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Nina Ruggiero, senior editorial director for Travel + Leisure. \u201cThe combination of varying state processes and shifting deadlines has added to the overall confusion around REAL IDs and likely led some travelers to take the deadlines less seriously.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019ve gotten a new ID in the last few years, it could already be REAL ID-compliant.",
      "\u201cI also hear from travelers who are confused as to whether or not they already have a REAL ID,\u201d Ruggiero said. \u201cSome people who have recently renewed their license may already have a compliant ID and not know it,\u201d so you may want to double-check yours before starting the process.",
      "A REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license has a symbol ( in most states, a star ) in the top corner of the card.",
      "If you live in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont or Washington, it\u2019s possible you could have an \u201cenhanced\u2033 ID card instead, which permits you to cross land and sea borders into Mexico and Canada from the U.S. It does not, however, allow you to fly into either of those countries.",
      "Enhanced IDs will have an American flag icon, as well as the word \u201cenhanced\u201d at the top of the card.",
      "The requirements vary by state, so you will need to visit the website of your state\u2019s driver\u2019s licensing agency to find out the specific steps, including whether you\u2019ll need to make an appointment at a DMV and what documentation you\u2019ll need when you get there.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a REAL ID by the deadline and you\u2019re planning to board a domestic flight, you will need to bring your passport or another TSA-approved form of identification when you travel.",
      "Otherwise, you could face \u201cdelays, additional screening and the possibility of not being permitted into the security checkpoint,\u201d warns TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein.",
      "In mid-April, a group of state senators from Kentucky asked the agency to delay implementing the new requirements yet again. They said the state has limited appointments available to people seeking the new cards and that there has been a rush to meet the May 7 deadline.",
      "However, TSA spokesperson Dan Velez told the AP that the agency does not intend to delay the REAL ID deadline again.",
      "As of late April, 81% of travelers at TSA checkpoints were presenting acceptable identification, including a state-issued REAL ID, according to DHS.",

Other DeSantis-backed bills that failed include measures to roll back some of the state's child labor protections and require all employers in the state to use E-Verify, a federal government system to verify work eligibility.",
      "Lawmakers also advanced measures aimed at curbing the power of the governor, which he can sign, veto or allow to become law without his signature.",
      "Legislators could revive bills axed by the governor, if two-thirds of both chambers vote to override his veto. They took that step in January to overturn some of DeSantis' line-item vetoes of last year's budget, a move seen as a bold act of defiance.",
      "Among the bills that could spark DeSantis' ire is a measure that would restrict development in state parks, following bipartisan backlash over a DeSantis administration proposal to build golf courses, pickleball courts and hotels in state parks.",
      "Lawmakers also passed a measure that would outlaw the use of public funds for political ads on proposed constitutional amendments after DeSantis led an aggressive campaign against two ballot initiatives in November. Another measure would prohibit state employees from fundraising for political campaigns or candidates while on the job.",
      "Also this session, lawmakers in DeSantis\u2019 own party scrutinized the welfare program that is his wife's signature initiative.",
      "Representatives began investigating Hope Florida amid revelations its foundation gave $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement to two nonprofits. Those groups in turn gave millions to a political committee, chaired by DeSantis\u2019 then-chief of staff, which campaigned against a failed referendum on recreational marijuana.",
      "Legislators wound down the probe after key officials involved in the transactions refused to testify, though lawmakers say the chamber's oversight will continue as they wait for state agencies to hand over a trove of public records related to Hope Florida.",
      "That is the average cost to Florida taxpayers for each day lawmakers have to come back to Tallahassee to carry out the public's business outside of a regular session, according to a spokesperson for the state Senate.",
      "Under the plan legislative leaders hashed out on Friday, lawmakers will return the week of May 12 for the extended session, which is scheduled to end June 6.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has posted an artificial intelligence-generated image of himself dressed as pope",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump posted an artificial intelligence-generated image of himself dressed as pope as the mourning of Pope Francis continues and just days before the conclave to elect his successor is set to begin. Trump's action drew rebukes from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and among Italians.",
      "The image, shared Friday night on Trump's Truth Social site and later reposted by the White House on its official X account, raised eyebrows on social media and at the Vatican, which is still in the period of nine days of official mourning following Francis' death on April 21. Catholic cardinals have been celebrating daily Masses in his memory and are due to open the conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday.",
      "The death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics, for whom the pope is Christ\u2019s vicar on Earth. That is all the more true in Italy, where the papacy is held in high esteem even by nonreligious Italians.",
      "The image featuring Trump in a white cassock and pointed miter, or bishop\u2019s hat, was the topic of several questions during the Vatican\u2019s daily conclave briefing Saturday. Italian and Spanish news reports lamented its poor taste and said it was offensive, given that the period of official mourning is still underway.",
      "Left-leaning former Premier Matteo Renzi said the image was shameful. \u201cThis is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\u201d Renzi wrote on X. \u201cMeanwhile, the U.S. economy risks recession and the dollar loses value. The sovereignists are doing damage, everywhere.\u201d",
      "The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to comment.",
      "In the United States, the New York State Catholic Conference, which represents the bishops of the state in working with government, accused Trump of mockery.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,\u201d they wrote. \"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.\u201d",
      "Italy\u2019s left-leaning La Repubblica also featured the image on its homepage Saturday with a commentary accusing Trump of \"pathological megalomania.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the backlash to the image or why the president had shared the image.",
      "But Jack Posobiec, a prominent far-right influencer and Trump ally who recently participated in a Catholic prayer event in March at Trump's Florida resort, defended the president.",
      "\"I\u2019m Catholic. We\u2019ve all been making jokes about the upcoming Pope selection all week. It\u2019s called a sense of humor,\" he wrote on X.",
      "The episode comes after Trump joked last week about his interest in the vacancy. \u201cI\u2019d like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,\" the thrice married president, who is not Catholic, told reporters.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, piled on.",
      "\u201cI was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope. This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!\u201d Graham, R-S.C., wrote on X. \u201cThe first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides. Watching for white smoke\u2026. Trump MMXXVIII!\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who is Catholic and was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the pope died, also joked about Secretary of State Marco Rubio becoming pope, suggesting Rubio could add it to the long list of titles he holds, including national security adviser and acting archivist.",
      "Beyond floating himself for the job, Trump also has put in a plug for Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.",
      "\u201cI have no preference. I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out a place called New York who's very good. So we'll see what happens,\u201d he said.",
      "Dolan, 75, is one of 10 U.S. cardinals who will be voting in the conclave, but Trump\u2019s pitch might have cost Dolan support.",
      "The reason conclaves are held in secrecy, with cardinals sequestered for the duration, is to prevent outside secular powers from influencing their choice, as occurred in centuries past.",
      "There is an old saying about campaigning for the job of pope or of being promoted excessively, especially by outsiders: If you \u201center a conclave as pope, you leave as a cardinal.\u201d",
      "While Trump attended Francis\u2019 funeral, he and Vance have clashed with U.S. bishops in general and Francis in particular over the administration\u2019s hard line stance on immigration and its efforts to deport migrants en masse. Right before he was hospitalized in February for pneumonia, Francis issued a strong rebuke of the administration's mass deportation plans and Vance's theological justification of it.",
      "Over 12 years as pope, Francis tried to remake the U.S. Catholic hierarchy more in his image, elevating pastors who prioritized social justice and migration issues over culture warriors who were more favored by his more doctrinaire predecessors St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI. A new pope who is more conservative could reverse that effort.",
      "Trump has nominated as his ambassador to the Holy See Brian Burch, whose Catholicvote.org has been aggressively covering the pre-conclave days at the Vatican. It was one of the main disseminators in English-speaking media of a report, flatly and officially denied by the Vatican, that Cardinal Pietro Parolin had had a health scare this past week that required medical attention.",
      "Parolin was the secretary of state under Francis and is seen as a leading contender to be pope. He is also the main architect of the Vatican\u2019s China policy and its controversial 2018 deal with Beijing over bishop nominations -- a deal that the was sharply criticized by the first Trump administration.",

      "The lawsuit claims the state and its most populous city, Denver, have passed \u201csanctuary laws\u201d violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\u201cThe United States has well-established, preeminent, and preemptive authority to regulate immigration matters,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Denver.",
      "There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help, particularly for large-scale deportations, and requests that police and sheriffs alert ICE to people it wants to deport and hold them until federal officers take custody.",
      "The Department of Justice has filed similar lawsuits against Chicago and Rochester, New York.",
      "Justice Department attorneys argue Colorado's \u201csanctuary policies\u201d allowed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to seize control of an apartment complex in the Denver suburb of Aurora.",
      "Local officials have called Trump\u2019s claims that the gang had taken over large swaths of the city exaggerated, but acknowledged the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people linked to Tren de Aragua.",
      "Friday\u2019s lawsuit lists as defendants Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, the state Legislature, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.",
      "Polis spokesperson Conor Cahill said in an email that Colorado is not a sanctuary state and regularly works with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.",

Lawmakers summoned the mayors of Denver, Boston, New York and Chicago to testify last month before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "The mayors pushed back, defending their communities as welcoming places, not lawless danger zones, and called on Congress to pass immigration reform.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 00:25:01 GMT",
    "summary": "In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.",
    "story": [
      "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.",
      "It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".",
      "For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something.",
      "I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline.",
      "While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell.",
      "Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\".",
      "His supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey.",
      "\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"",
      "At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.",
      "\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.",
      "In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.",
      "When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.",
      "Fighting threats to sovereignty",
      "Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.",
      "It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him.",
      "This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.",
      "The election result was staggering.",
      "Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls.",
      "Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide.",
      "But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened.",
      "Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.",
      "The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump.",
      "Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government.",
      "Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump.",
      "And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.",
      "Carney's strategy",
      "Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier.",
      "He also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere.",
      "Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.",
      "In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards.",
      "He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.",
      "On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.",
      "All roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.",
      "Assuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most of the world.",
      "It is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.",
      "All of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire \"trade deal\" process.",
      "Japan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a \"card\" in negotiations.",
      "The EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.",
      "It comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.",
      "There is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions.",
      "The flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.",
      "As a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.",
      "But Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue.",
      "He will reach across the aisle for a \"Team Canada\" approach to talks with the US.",
      "The Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.",
      "This is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country.",

      "On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was \"a wake-up call\" to government on the issue.",
      "Ways to pay",
      "Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.",

      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",

      "In a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: \"In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.\"",
      "That means back to \"pen and paper\", he said.",
      "Greencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.",

      "The US president has said the new tariff, along with a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month, is intended to push carmakers to do more manufacturing in the US.",

      "As it stands currently, parts made in Mexico and Canada in compliance with that free trade agreement will be spared the duties. Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.",
      "Trump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.",
      "The administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content.",
      "\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"",

      "But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, said it damaged American businesses and was used to smuggle illegal goods, including drugs.",
      "What was the de minimis exemption?",
      "De minimis is a Latin term, which loosely translates to English as \"of the smallest\".",
      "In this context it refers to a US trade rule enacted by Congress in 1938 to avoid the expense of collecting only small amounts of import levies.",

      "The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on Chinese imports. His administration said in April that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.",
      "US authorities have also blamed the success of firms like Temu and Shein for putting strains on border authorities, as the number of packages entering the US under the loophole surged from about 140 million a decade ago to more than one billion last year.",
      "What does it mean for online shoppers?",
      "Packages sent to the US from mainland China and Hong Kong with a value of up to $800 now face a 120% tax rate or are subject to a flat fee. The fee started at $100 and is due to rise to $200 at the beginning of June.",
      "Even before these packages were subject to import taxes, US consumers were warned of potential price rises.",
      "The American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy group, estimated last year that getting rid of the exemption would result in \"$8bn to $30bn in additional annual costs that would eventually be passed on to consumers\".",

The working paper also suggested that the mark-up charged on pet cremations, sold to customers at a \"vulnerable moment\", might be capped.",
      "The watchdog has also suggested a comparison website making it compulsory for clinics to inform owners if cheaper options are available.",

      "The competition body highlighted how the sector was increasingly being dominated by larger firms and how this might be reducing consumer choice.",
      "There are about 5,000 vet practices in the UK, it said, but since 2013, approximately 1,500 of these have been acquired by six large corporate groups.",
      "They are CVS, Independent Vetcare Ltd, Linnaeus, Medivet, Pets at Home and VetPartners.",
      "Four of these six tend to retain the name and branding of an independently-owned practice when they buy it, which the CMA said may create an \"illusion of competition\" for consumers if they are trying to shop around to find alternative practices.",
      "While most of the bigger groups own their practices outright, Pets at Home told the watchdog that the majority that it runs are 50-50 joint ventures with individual owners who are vets, nurses or practice managers."

      "The US has signed a deal with Kyiv to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves, after months of tense negotiations.",
      "The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.",
      "Ukraine is believed to have vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium and lithium. They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine.",
      "The deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war.",
      "According to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.",
      "The US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".",
      "The language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.",
      "It refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".",

      "Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\".",
      "Listing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.",
      "The partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.",
      "Under the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv.",
      "Crucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.",
      "But that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.",
      "The deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.",
      "The source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.",
      "Technical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.",
      "The initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\".",
      "The breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.",
      "Phoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.",
      "\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"",
      "The US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".",
      "\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.",
      "\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"",
      "The agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have and what are they used for?"

      "It's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.",
      "Yiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.",

      "About $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.",
      "But things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: \"Other countries have money too!\"",
      "That defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.",
      "Beijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.",
      "The propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.",
      "And in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.",
      "\"We don't care about that 20-30%,\" Mr Hu says. \"We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.\"",

      "\"He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,\" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. \"But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.\"",
      "Trump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic.",
      "And, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.",
      "In the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of \"a fair deal with China\" that his administration was \"actively\" negotiating.",
      "But China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as \"groundless with no factual basis\". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  \"Trump is probably the worst president in American history,\" read one on state TV.",
      "It seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.",
      "\"We in China say \u2013 we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,\" Col Zhou says. \"That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months \u2013 hopefully not more than three months.\"",
      "It cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.",

      "The terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.",
      "Goldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.",
      "The BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.",
      "When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.",
      "The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.",
      "Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.",
      "Opportunities beyond America",
      "The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.",
      "Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.",
      "Some 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world \"Feliz Navidad\" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.",

    "summary": "Weather influencers can provide useful local information but are also accused of exaggerating conditions.",
    "story": [
      "As the skies unleashed six months of rain in February over North Queensland, Australia, many locals endured sleepless nights, unsure what level of flooding and damage they would wake up to.",
      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "\"Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.",
      "Born in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.",
      "Growing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.",
      "After his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.",
      "\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"",
      "Border crossings, egg prices and jobs - Trump's 100 days speech fact-checked",
      "Trump eases car tariffs after firms raised concerns",
      "Alberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.",
      "In fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.",
      "The work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.",
      "\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.",
      "Almost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.",
      "He was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.",
      "\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.",
      "\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"",
      "In their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.",
      "All the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.",
      "Daniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.",
      "\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.",
      "Daniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.",
      "As well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.",
      "After his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".",
      "He has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.",
      "Mexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.",
      "So far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing.",
      "The latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.",
      "However, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.",
      "The threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.",
      "The Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.",
      "Still, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.",
      "The few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.",
      "Beyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce.",
      "With its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.",
      "\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"",
      "Nora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.",
      "\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.",
      "The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.",
      "He grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.",
      "While in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.",
      "Now 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.",
      "\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"",
      "For Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.",
      "\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.",
      "While the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.",
      "If so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.",

      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",

      "It's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",

      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",

They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",

    "story": [
      "Uber is now allowing passengers across most of the UK to pay in cash.",
      "Following trials, the cash payment option was this week extended to all UK cities, except London, where it is being reviewed.",
      "But individual drivers can still opt out of accepting notes and coins, partly if they are worried about safety of carrying them in their vehicles.",
      "The move came as a major report suggested shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.",
      "On Wednesday, the Treasury Committee of MPs stopped short of recommending mandated cash acceptance now, but said its report was \"a wake-up call\" to government on the issue.",
      "Ways to pay",
      "Uber has become a huge company and dominates the global ride-hailing market, as well as operating in a host of other transport sectors. Its rapid ascent has come with controversy and protests from other taxi providers.",
      "The taxi app's success has been based around new technology, but meant customers needed cashless payments to use its services.",
      "Following pilots in Birmingham, Stoke, Nottingham and Leicester, Uber said it has now extended the option of paying in cash to other UK cities, because some people preferred paying in cash or did not have a bank card.",
      "\"We believe that movement should be accessible to everyone, so following successful pilots in some UK cities over the last 18 months, we have decided to give passengers outside of London the option to pay for trips with cash,\" a spokesman said.",
      "Passengers can select cash as their payment option on the app. Drivers can opt out in preferences on their own app.",
      "If they do not have enough change, that is given as a credit to the passenger by Uber.",
      "The cash option is being reviewed by authorities in London, and remains unavailable for Uber Eats or booking for other forms of transport via the Uber app.",
      "Tracing payments danger",
      "Cash campaigner Ron Delnevo from the Payment Choice Alliance said Uber's move \"demonstrates that they now believe in the future of cash in the UK\", and brought the company's operations in the UK in line with many other countries.",
      "He called on the government to introduce a law that would force all shops and services to accept cash.",
      "Ministers have said there are no plans to introduce such rules.",
      "However, the Treasury Committee's recent report did highlight various groups who relied on cash, including some people with learning disabilities and those who use cash to keep to a budget.",
      "Among those reliant on cash, and who gave evidence to the committee, were victim-survivors of domestic and economic abuse.",
      "Many face the dangers of being traced by their abuser via the payments they make. Buying a train ticket, for example, could only be done with cash in order to avoid an abusive partner becoming aware of their movements.",
      "\"It really is a matter of life and death,\" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse. \"Without it they find themselves monitored daily, with every transaction.\"",
      "Joint bank accounts and mortgages had also been used as a way to impose coercive control over somebody, she said.",
      "And cash could be used as an eventual escape route.",
      "\"One victim-survivor said she hid pockets of cash around her house until she had enough to flee her abuser,\" she said.",
      "The charity would like to see cash acceptance backed by law, but Ms Smethers said she welcomed the focus the committee's report had put on the plight of those facing economic abuse.",

      "Instead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.",
      "China is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.",
      "\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.",
      "His confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.",
      "Xi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?",
      "Xi's domestic challenges",
      "With a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.",
      "This has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.",
      "Housing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.",
      "The former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.",
      "Travel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.",
      "The government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.",
      "And it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.",
      "They are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.",
      "There are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.",
      "The problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.",
      "\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.",
      "\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"",
      "According to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"",
      "To revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".",
      "\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"",
      "This is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.",
      "A political test for Xi",
      "Xi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.",
      "A report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.",
      "All protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.",
      "\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.",
      "This promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.",
      "Where the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.",
      "It has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.",
      "Yet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.",
      "The restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.",
      "Despite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Turning a challenge into an opportunity",
      "President Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.",
      "\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"",
      "Donald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "China is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.",
      "In 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.",
      "Geopolitical gains",
      "As Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.",
      "The Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.",
      "Around a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Recent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.",
      "\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.",
      "China will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.",
      "Trump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.",
      "According to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".",
      "There are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.",
      "China has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.",
      "In 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.",
      "Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.",
      "China's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Even with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.",

      "Its general secretary, Paul Whiteman, said the plans amounted to \"another crude grading system to hang over the heads of leaders\", and should be scrapped.",
      "Ofsted said supporting mental health was an important part of the proposals, and that the union's legal claims were \"plainly untenable\".",

      "A letter signed by Professor Julia Waters with more than 30 others last week, including the general secretaries of four teaching unions, warned the changes would \"continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of education staff and hence on students' school experience\".",
      "On Friday, Mr Whiteman told NAHT members: \"Following Ruth's death, we were promised change.",
      "\"What we've been offered, if you scratch beneath the surface, is more of the same - another crude grading system to hang over the heads of leaders.\"",
      "Mr Whiteman said school leaders embraced accountability, but it was \"utter nonsense\" that Ofsted's proposed model was the only viable way to assess schools.",
      "He called on Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver to \"scrap these proposals\" and \"think again\".",
      "Prof Waters said she shared head teachers' frustrations because, while schools should be accountable, the new system \"could be worse than the flawed and dangerous process it replaces\".",
      "\"We have enough evidence from repeated inquiries and other national systems that show what might work better for pupils, parents, and teachers as a system of school inspection in England,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

    "summary": "Robert Harris says the dynamic of the secretive ritual \"is why often it produces a surprise\".",
    "story": [
      "The bestselling novelist Robert Harris says a conclave to select a new Pope has a similar dynamic to hit TV show The Traitors.",
      "The author of Conclave, which was last year turned into an Oscar-winning film adaptation, said the programme - in which \"faithful\" contestants are tasked with trying to work out the \"traitors\" among them - was \"the nearest analogy I can come to\".",
      "\"Suddenly everyone swings to one person - you can't see why, particularly, but it happens,\" he tells BBC News ahead of the election to replace Pope Francis, due to begin next week.",
      "\"And in a funny way, a similar dynamic does operate in a conclave, which is why often it produces a surprise.\"",
      "But Harris argues that it is a process UK political parties should learn from.",
      "The writer argues his book and the subsequent film illustrates how the ancient, secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a \"rather brilliant device\" for finding the right person to lead an organisation.",
      "Only male cardinals under the age of 80 are entitled to participate. The voting is conducted in total privacy, with the news of a decision announced by white smoke emerging from a chimney on the chapel's roof.",
      "Political parties throwing the election of their leaders open to the wider membership \"has not produced very good results\", Harris says.",
      "He says it would be better if a select number \"who have seen the candidates close up, day in, day out, choose who the leader should be\".",
      "He continues: \"To lock the door and say you're not going to come out until you've come up with a result concentrates the mind - and if you look back, the popes have been pretty good.",
      "\"I didn't come away from researching the novel thinking this is a terrible idea [and that] I must write a novel to expose how awful it is. In a way, the novel shows a conclave working.\"",
      "However, the Fatherland and Archangel author thinks it is strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.",
      "\"Can any sophisticated religion, with such a huge following, really go on and on into the future with such a secondary, demeaning role for women?\" he asks.",
      "\"I mean, it just seems odd. Would Christ really have only wanted his word to be spread by men?\"",
      "Harris says the character of Sister Agnes - a nun who speaks out during a crucial moment in his fictitious conclave - was a \"vital\" creation.",
      "\"I wanted to find some way of getting the female voice in this process, and the only way is the women who serve the meals, clean the rooms and run the hostel when the cardinals are there,\" he explains. \"I really wanted to make them a part of the story.\"",
      "Harris says that, while researching his novel about conclave, Pope Francis's office gave him permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders.",
      "\"They showed me the most extraordinary things and allowed me to walk along the corridor to the balcony where the new Pope shows himself to the huge crowd in St Peter's Square,\" he recounts. \"That was a breathtaking moment.\"",
      "Harris says that, when piecing together the process of the conclave, he realised he had \"stumbled on a treasure trove\".",
      "\"I think that the conclave is a rather brilliant device for finding the right sort of person who can command the respect of the church.\"",
      "\"It's spiritual and human and political drama all woven into one,\" he says. \"A conclave is as dramatic as the reading of a will. It's that level of natural drama.\"",
      "After the publication of Conclave in 2016, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor - who had helped Harris with his research - asked for a copy in Italian to give to Pope Francis.",
      "\"I gave him the book and he said he thought the translation looked pretty good, but I don't know whether the Pope did read it. If he did, he didn't say anything to me.\"",

      "More than two million people have attended a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, city officials say.",
      "The pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy.",
      "They expect it could bring in $100m (\u00a375m) to the local economy.",

      "Some fans - known as Gaga's \"Little Monsters\" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.",
      "A massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event.",
      "Lady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.",

    "summary": "Is Blue Ivy another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight or could she be a genuine star?",
    "story": [
      "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "Her numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.",
      "\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.",
      "Being a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.",
      "The teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?",
      "'An easier ride'",
      "This is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.",
      "But music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".",
      "\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"",
      "Sullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.",
      "Speaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".",
      "She added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "Blue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.",
      "\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.",
      "Sullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".",
      "Many critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".",
      "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.",
      "Twigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".",
      "\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"",
      "North West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.",
      "\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.",
      "In December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.",
      "The cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"",
      "The story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".",
      "It was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.",
      "Gwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".",
      "Similarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".",
      "Almost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".",
      "Hudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.",
      "Pam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"",
      "She explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.",
      "As fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

      "The thriller about slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Words of War, opens in US cinemas today. The filmmakers took into account some of the inaccuracy concerns about the script raised by her family, Politkovskaya's sister Elena Kudimova told the BBC.",
      "The film is coming out just in time for the World Press Freedom Day. Words of War was produced by Sean Penn. Anna Politkovskaya is played by Maxine Peake, and one of the leading male roles is performed by Jason Isaacs.",
      "Words of War tells the story of legendary Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya.",
      "In Russia, her name is synonymous with courage and an indomitable spirit. She rose to prominence for her investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya - a region in southern Russia that fought two wars for independence in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Her older sister, Elena Kudimova, describes her as \"someone who, despite all the threats and the danger to her life, kept doing her work until the very end.\"",
      "Politkovskaya openly criticised the Russian authorities and President Putin himself. Despite receiving numerous threats over the years, she refused to back down.",
      "Her sister recalls that while Politkovskaya considered emigration, she always changed her mind at the last moment. She would say: \"I can't leave because nobody else will help the people here.\"",
      "Reporting the war in Chechnya",
      "From 1999, Politkovskaya traveled to Chechnya almost every month for several years. Kudimova recalls that for many wronged and desperate people, Politkovskaya became \"the last resort\" - the one who could make things right.",
      "She took part in the negotiations for Nord-Ost, the 2002 hostage crisis at a Moscow theatre, after the Chechen rebels specifically requested her.",
      "In 2004, she hoped to help resolve the crisis in Beslan, where heavily armed militants held hostages in a school for three days.",
      "However, she never made it there - she was poisoned on the plane while en route to Beslan.",
      "In 2006, Politkovskaya was shot dead in the elevator of her apartment building in Moscow. Six men were convicted over the murder, but the person who ordered it has never been identified.",
      "Her sister Elena doubts that the mastermind will ever be brought to justice. \"If they had wanted to find him, they probably would have done so by now,\" Kudimova adds.",
      "Avoiding clich\u00e9s",
      "Before the film's release, Politkovskaya's family raised concerns about the Words of War script, believing the film took too many liberties with the truth.",
      "While the filmmakers insist that the drama is based on real events, they emphasise that it is not a biography.",
      "However, Politkovskaya's sister notes that the filmmakers did take the family's feedback into account, and certain scenes that raised the most questions were removed from the final cut.",
      "\"[Anna's son] Ilya was portrayed in the original script as a sort of womanizer, [and in the film] Anna doesn't have a romance with [Dmitry] Muratov,\" she said.",
      "Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Prize-winning journalist, was Anna Politkovskaya's former colleague at the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.",

      "\"Her real life had far more dramatic episodes than those shown in the film,\" she says.",
      "Kudimova criticised the film's setting for leaning too heavily into cold-weather clich\u00e9s.",
      "\"I was struck by the fact that it's constantly snowing, as if Russia has only one season. In reality, we have all four.\" However, Kudimova is grateful that the film helps preserve the memory of her sister.",
      "Anna's legacy",
      "Kudimova said that Anna never thought about her own legacy. She recalled how, at some point, someone had suggested Anna write an autobiography - she was in her 40s at the time.",
      "Anna had laughed at the idea, saying it felt more like something you do when you're a hundred. But then she came up with the idea of writing six short stories.",
      "At the end of each, she said, she was supposed to die - but didn't, for different reasons. And they were going to be funny stories.",
      "When asked about how Anna would want to be remembered, Elena says that her sister did not think about her legacy: \"She simply wanted to live.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",

      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "They perform most of their lyrics in Irish, drawing inspiration from a burgeoning underground scene of \"as Gaeilge\" rap acts like Iml\u00e9 and Seamus Barra (the latter was even name-checked in their debut single).",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",

      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",

    "summary": "As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

      "\"I didn't know what was happening and my parents didn't either,\" says the 15-year-old. \"It was scary. The attacks would occur without warning. It got worse and I began to have them in public.\"",
      "Lucy started missing a lot of school and stopped socialising. She says it was hard for her parents to see her struggling. \"We didn't know what to do or where to go.\"",
      "For six months, she tried to manage her anxiety herself, but eventually the family decided to pay for a talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy.",
      "Lucy says it has made a huge difference. While she still has panic attacks, they are much less frequent and she is back attending school and doing the things she enjoys.",
      "Lucy's story is far from unique. NHS figures suggest one in five children and young people aged eight to 25 has a probable mental health disorder.",
      "Why problems are so common",
      "The teenage years are when problems become increasingly common as young people grapple with the challenges of growing up, exam stresses, and friendships and relationships.",
      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement. This means young people can feel things very intensely before they've fully developed the ability to manage those feelings, which helps explain some of the emotional ups and downs parents often see.\"",

      "The most common problems teenagers experience are low mood and anxiety. For low mood, Prof Danese says, maintaining healthy routines around eating, sleeping, being active and keeping in touch with friends and family is important as is planning activities that your child enjoys, such as trips out or playing a sport.",
      "\"And help them identify, break down and try out solutions for problems that may have arisen,\" he adds.",
      "For anxiety, calming techniques are helpful, he says. These can include breathing exercises, grounding, whereby you concentrate on the environment around you and what you can see, touch and smell, and mindfulness activities.",
      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",
      "Building resilience",
      "Stevie Goulding, who runs the parent helpline for Young Minds, says anxiety is the issue they get the most calls about.",
      "\"Many children will have bouts of anxiety and even panic attacks. It's difficult for parents. They can easily find themselves lacking in confidence and judgement about what to do. We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",
      "\"The main advice we give parents is to communicate with their children. Give them permission to talk about what is bothering them \u2013 and if they don't want to talk to them, ask if there is someone else they would prefer to talk to.\"",
      "Ms Goulding also recommends talking to your child's school as they may have noticed things too.",

    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",

    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",

    "story": [
      "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.",
      "Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.",
      "It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.",
      "\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"",
      "Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\".",
      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",

    "summary": "The first minister will set out his programme for government this week, with a focus on steadying the ship.",
    "story": [
      "Scotland's first minister John Swinney is not planning a party to celebrate his first anniversary in Holyrood's top political office. That's not really his style.",
      "Instead of cake, balloons and fizzy wine he will mark this milestone by announcing an updated \"programme for government\" - as the countdown begins to the next Holyrood election in almost exactly a year's time.",
      "As Swinney told me at a recent news conference, this is not about tearing up his existing programme and starting again but building on what's already there.",
      "Four priorities",
      "It's an opportunity for him to show that his focus is on the day job rather than on dreams of independence.",
      "You can expect him to talk a lot about his four stated priorities: improving public services, growing the economy, reducing child poverty and tackling climate change.",
      "Swinney specifically wants to deliver noticeable improvements in the NHS over the next 12 months.",
      "That's not only because the public wants faster access to diagnosis and treatment but also because he believes cutting the queues is the best way to build trust with voters and to retain power.",
      "He has also promised further economic action which in the short term could be about doing more to ease the cost of living pressures that many people feel.",
      "On 7 May next year the public will pass judgement on what will by then be 19 years of the SNP in government in Scotland.",
      "Voters will ultimately decide whether to keep John Swinney as first minister or kick him out.",
      "The Conservatives, Labour and other opposition parties argue that the SNP's record in office requires a change of political direction.",
      "They highlight long waits in the health service, high levels of drug deaths and new ferries arriving years overdue and seriously overbudget.",
      "Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has said that if the SNP knew how to solve Scotland's problems, they would have done it by now.",
      "While Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay wants his party to be seen as a lower tax alternative to both the SNP and Labour.",
      "Yet Swinney has greater cause for optimism about his political prospects now than he did a year ago.",
      "There has been a remarkable shift in the Scottish political narrative since he replaced Humza Yousaf as first minister.",
      "You may remember that Yousaf brought himself down by ending the SNP's power-sharing deal with the Scottish Greens.",
      "That set him up for a confidence vote that he no longer had sufficient support to win and he stood down as first minister.",
      "Swinney's inheritance was challenging.",
      "His was a party fractured over independence strategy, gender politics and environmental commitments plus the legacy of harassment complaints against the former first minister Alex Salmond that were mishandled by the Scottish government.",
      "Then there was the ongoing police investigation into the SNP's finances which has since developed into a criminal prosecution of the party's former chief executive Peter Murrell.",
      "In July last year the SNP was heavily defeated by Labour in the UK general election but John Swinney, who had only just returned to the political frontline, escaped much of the blame.",
      "It was not that his colleagues forgot that he had been at the heart of SNP government for most of the party's time in office.",
      "It was that many saw him as the only figure with the knowledge, experience and political clout to manage the aftermath of such a major meltdown.",
      "Steadying the ship",
      "Swinney was elected party leader unopposed in May last year and moved quickly to patch up some of the divisions within the SNP by appointing Kate Forbes to his cabinet as deputy first minister.",
      "There have been other changes too.",
      "He no longer has a minister for independence, has shelved plans to pilot juryless rape trials and the creation of a new national care service has been dropped in all but name.",
      "Swinney has skilfully worked to calm controversy and steady the ship.",
      "The UK Supreme Court's decision on the definition of a woman under the Equality Act is another example.",
      "The judges decided biological sex and not acquired gender was the answer.",
      "Swinney immediately accepted the ruling as if it was a minor clarification of the law rather than a comprehensive defeat for the Scottish government by the campaign group For Women Scotland.",
      "The Conservatives are determined that the fall-out from this legal battle at least merits an apology from the first minister to the women who took the case to court.",
      "Instead, Swinney promises revised guidance on the provision and use of single-sex spaces and no attempt to revisit legislation to make it easier for trans people to legally change their gender.",
      "He insists he will protect the rights of everyone in Scotland and hopes that will help him glide past this particular row.",
      "The divisions in his party on this issue suggest his difficulties may not be so easily overcome, although the looming election may help bring different factions together.",
      "Unifying figure",
      "Having watched his old boss Nicola Sturgeon finish her term in office as a deeply polarising figure, John Swinney is attempting to avoid the same fate.",
      "That is why he is recasting himself as a unifying figure - someone prepared to reach out across party lines to work with others to get things done.",
      "Yes, this is the same John Swinney who played a central role in the independence referendum that literally made voters choose between \"yes\" and \"no\" on the question of leaving the UK political union.",
      "To be fair, the first minister demonstrated a capacity for more inclusive politics during the Scottish budget process, making sufficient concessions to other parties so that only the Scottish Conservatives voted against.",
      "He presented his recent \"summit\" with political, faith and civic leaders to counter anti-democratic forces in a similar light.",
      "However, his main rivals think that event, which excluded Reform UK, elevated Nigel Farage's party in the Scottish national debate.",
      "Reform UK is persistently polling in double figures in Scotland and other pro-UK parties are worried.",
      "While Swinney obviously despises Reform's hostility to both immigration and the pursuit of net zero, he also knows they are more likely to take votes from the Conservatives and Labour than the SNP.",
      "After Reform's big gains in the English local elections on Thursday, there is a significant electoral test of their support in Scotland in just over a month.",
      "The Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election on Thursday 5 June, following the death of SNP minister Christina McKelvie, will be widely seen as a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour.",
      "This constituency vote has the capacity to entrench or overturn the prevailing narrative in Scottish politics - that Scottish Labour has lost momentum as a result of difficult decisions by the UK government on issues like welfare.",
      "With a year to go, it looks perfectly possible that the SNP - far less popular than it has been in recent years - could still win a fifth term in office at Holyrood.",
      "If the SNP can hold the Hamilton seat, their confidence will rise.",
      "If Labour can take it from them, it will revive Anas Sarwar's sense that the public mood is for further political change.",
      "Labour thinks they can win if the vote is a referendum on SNP performance in devolved government but they fear that if it becomes a vote of confidence in Labour's decision-making at UK level they will struggle.",
      "The UK Labour government may have delivered record funding to the Scottish government but the SNP will not let the public forget the Treasury's cuts to the winter fuel payment for pensioners, which Scottish ministers plan to mitigate.",
      "Scottish Labour could do with the UK government using its economic clout to help address challenges in Scotland.",
      "They were delighted by the prime minister's promise of \u00a3200m to help secure a future for the Grangemouth industrial site but some in the party would like to see further intervention.",
      "With the Hamilton by-election a month away, the Conservatives start as the third placed party.",
      "They are worried that their new leader Russell Findlay has not had enough time to prevent Reform UK knocking them into fourth.",
      "Whatever Reform's performance, all parties will want to analyse what it might mean if replicated at the Holyrood election where the voting system is designed to make it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.",
      "Without a Scottish leader, a policy programme or an established organisational structure, Reform UK claims to have 10,000 members in Scotland who have turned to them because they are so fed up with politics as usual.",
      "One further twist is that when Nigel Farage turns up to campaign in the by-election he is likely to face detailed questions on recent comments where he suggested he was relaxed about John Swinney continuing in power.",
      "That may make his brand of politics less acceptable to pro-UK voters even though independence has slipped down the political agenda and there seems little prospect of another referendum anytime soon.",
      "Farage's mission in Scotland he told the BBC is to gain a foothold at Holyrood, become part of the Scottish national conversation and then to replace the Conservatives.",
      "That may help to explain why Russell Findlay is leaning more towards Reform UK positions in some policy areas.",
      "For example, he recently called for a more affordable transition to a low carbon economy or what Reform calls \"net stupid zero\".",
      "This type of Tory tilt, designed to stop their traditional supporters switching to Reform, has already cost the party the defection of MSP Jamie Greene to the Liberal Democrats - a significant coup for their leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.",
      "The Scottish Greens who gained significant profile during their period in government and will attract further attention when they elect a new co-leader to replace Patrick Harvie in the summer are among the range of other parties contesting the by-election and the Holyrood campaign in 2026.",
      "Senior SNP figures tell me that independence will feature in their national campaign and ministers have promised one further paper completing their independence prospectus in the coming months.",
      "That said, only the most optimistic independence supporter would predict another referendum in the next five years if there's a \"yes\" majority at Holyrood after the 2026 election.",
      "The issue is not dead but it certainly feels more dormant than at any time over the past decade.",
      "The less that constitutional politics is to the fore, the more space there will be to discuss the competing offers from rival parties on the domestic issues over which Holyrood has control.",
      "That's health, education, law and order, parts of welfare, transport, the environment and some aspects of the economy.",
      "Then there is global uncertainty.",
      "Politics at home is vulnerable to the impact of global issues, whether that's import tariffs from the US President Donald Trump or the effects of conflicts in the Middle East, Ukraine or elsewhere.",
      "Some of these issues may change the context in which domestic debates take place. Others could impact on the UK economy directly or as a knock-on effect.",
      "The US president and his vice-president JD Vance have been known to speak up for their preferred candidates in other people's elections.",
      "That's what John Swinney did when he suggested US voters back Donald Trump's principal opponent Kamala Harris. Don't be surprised if the Trump administration returns the compliment.",
      "There's no reason to think the first minister would lose sleep having President Trump against him or having Nigel Farage as a foil. Both could help motivate his political base.",
      "No-one in Scottish politics can take anything for granted. A lot can change in a year and uncertainty is likely to be a hallmark of the campaign to come.",
      "John Swinney and his rivals for the job of first minister are probably best advised to keep their fizzy wine on ice."

    "summary": "It suggests the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first past the post-election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, ten points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, Ukip, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first-past-the-post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Chadsmoor in Staffordshire and Romney Marsh in Kent.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

      "The first is how Labour and the Conservatives respond to what has happened \u2013 not least the rapid rise of Reform UK, but also the Liberal Democrats and to a lesser extent the Green Party.",

      "Fuller said the Tories would not make a pact with Reform, adding Farage \"has been very clear that he wants to destroy the Conservative Party\".",
      "The Lib Dems were the other standout winners, gaining 163 seats and control of three councils. They seized Shropshire from the Tories and gained control of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire after both previously had no party in overall control.",

      "Labour MP Richard Burgon \u2013 a shadow minister under Sir Keir's left wing predecessor Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 agreed.",

      "A defeated Labour councillor from Lancashire, Matthew Tomlinson, described himself as \"an extremely loyal Labour Party supporter\".",

      "The final result, from a46.2% turnout, beats the previous post-war record for the closest by-election, which the Liberals won by 57 votes in Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1973.",
      "Farage, who appeared at the count shortly before the result was declared, said his party takes on the responsibility that comes with winning elections \"with glee\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjnzz7kvdlo",
    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 07:56:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimate included in official review of costs and impact of passing assisted dying law in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

    "story": [
      "When the UK became the first major economy in the world to commit to reducing its carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, there was so little disagreement among MPs it was simply 'nodded through' without a vote.",
      "Six years on, the political climate is very different, the consensus at Westminster has shattered and reaching net zero is fast becoming a political dividing line.",
      "Labour has committed itself to an extra deadline: reaching clean power by 2030.",
      "The Greens and Liberal Democrats want to hit net zero faster, the Conservatives are slamming the brakes on their policy and, for the first time, there is now a mainstream party, Reform UK, openly questioning the need to reach net zero at all.",
      "Even a former Labour prime minister, Sir Tony Blair, has said that existing global approaches to tackling climate change aren't working (although it was later clarified that his institute supports the government's targets).",
      "So what's happened?",

      "Blair says current net zero policies 'doomed to fail'",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "In 2019, when the target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 was set, public concern about climate change was very visible.",
      "Thousands of people had joined Extinction Rebellion marches and the then-teenage activist Greta Thunberg was so influential she was invited to address MPs in Parliament.",
      "Luke Tryl, pollster for More in Common, says he has not found a significant drop in concern about climate change or support for net zero, even if we're not seeing people on the streets.",
      "What has changed, he says, is the conversation around it which, after the rising cost of living and the war in Ukraine, has switched to \"how does this reflect on people's pockets and does it make people think the country is safer as a result?\"",
      "He also says the debate has become \"more polarised between left and right\" with Labour and Lib Dem voters seeing it as a \"top three\" issue, while Reform voters are more opposed to net zero but less motivated by it: only one in 10 people vote Nigel Farage's party because of net zero, Tryl's research suggests.",
      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",
      "Another is that the easy things have already been done and \"we're now getting to the things that will touch on people's lives\".",
      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",
      "\"Labour has to be solid on it because it's a manifesto commitment and because it is a point of distinction with the parties on the right.",

      "\"It would be a dereliction of duty for the Labour party to win a landslide on difficult things and then go, 'do you know what, it's too difficult'.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Scottish government has confirmed it will not bring forward planned legislation to criminalise misogyny before next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A bill has long been promised to improve protections for women and girls, but ministers now say there is not enough time to draw up a law which reflects the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.",
      "They are instead going to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex.",
      "The government has also confirmed it will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy this term, and is hoping for a UK-wide solution.",
      "A new misogyny law was promised after an expert group in 2022 backed separate legislation rather than incorporating abuse and violence against women into Scotland's hate crime law.",
      "The group, led by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC, said this was a better option because women are not a minority, and a \"more fundamental set of responses\" were required to address the \"deeply rooted\" problem.",
      "The Scottish government proposed creating five new offences in its Misogyny Bill including stirring up hatred against women and misogynistic harassment.",
      "Misogyny would also be treated as an aggravating factor in crimes, which could lead to tougher sentencing.",
      "QC shocked by level of misogyny in Scotland",
      "Why are women not protected by new hate crime law?",
      "The Scottish government said it remained committed to ensuring people are protected from misogynistic abuse but it was a \"complex area of policy and law\" which required more time to work out where it would apply.",
      "This would include assessing the implications of the recent Supreme Court judgement that a woman is defined by biological sex for the purposes of equality legislation, it said.",
      "It said there was insufficient time to proceed with the bill in this parliamentary session, but in September it would add the protected characteristic of sex to Scotland's hate crime act.",
      "First Minister John Swinney said: \"We have to navigate a way through all of the issues that come out of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"What action we can take is action we can take during this parliamentary term to tackle misogyny and that's what the government will do\".",
      "Conversion therapy",
      "The Scottish government said it was also dropping plans for a new law banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Both pieces of legislation were part of the Bute House Agreement with the Scottish Greens which ended in April last year.",
      "Ministers previously said Scotland wanted to lead the way in outlawing such practices - but it has now urged the Labour government at Westminster to legislate on the issue.",
      "Equalities Minister Kaukab Stewart said if an approach covering Scotland, England and Wales could not be agreed, the Scottish government would introduce its own law within a year if it remained in power after next year's Holyrood election.",
      "A joint statement from Scottish LGBTQIA+ organisations said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" to see an end to conversion practices would not proceed - and that the community had felt rights were being \"rolled back and reduced\" for a long time.",
      "The statement said: \"Simply put, the longer it takes to legislate to end conversion practices the more harm will be done, including to those most vulnerable.",
      "\"The failure to progress this bill is yet another blow to our community's faith in government and the institutions that are meant to represent and protect us.\"",
      "Publishing this news in a written question on a Friday morning after elections down south is a classic attempt from the Scottish government to bury some bad news.",
      "In fairness, it is true to say that drawing up complicated legislation before the ink is even dry on a relevant Supreme Court's ruling would be a challenge in the remaining year of the Holyrood term.",
      "But a bill can pass in a matter of days if the political will is there.",
      "And women's groups are already deeply suspicious of the government, given it has spent the last few years engaged in court battle with campaigners about fundamental definitions.",
      "Ministers will point to the move to beef up hate crime law as evidence they are taking action on behalf of women and girls - despite the fact they were originally omitted from that bill with the promise of bespoke legislation.",
      "The point of this move is to get some awkward issues out of the way before John Swinney makes his programme for government speech next week about what he is  planning on doing for the rest of the Holyrood term.",
      "But for all he is keen to get away from spiky debates around gender politics - and you can read the shelving of the conversion therapy ban as part of that too - he is still going to face plenty of questions about this.",
      "Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton MSP said the misogyny bill was the latest in a \"litany of paused, ditched or botched\" policies from Nicola Sturgeon's time as first minister.",
      "She said: \"Misogyny remains a serious problem and it's crucial that women and girls are protected from all forms of threatening and abusive behaviour in a way that safeguards their rights.\"",
      "Scottish Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson Christine Jardine MP said: \"This is the wrong thing to do.",
      "\"The proposed legislation was a chance to substantially improve protections, help change culture and behaviours and move us closer to eradicating misogyny.\"",
      "'Screeching U-turn'",
      "Scottish Labour justice spokesperson Pauline McNeill said \"This is a shameful broken promise to Scottish women at a time when misogynistic hatred is on the rise.",

      "At the time, it said the money would be used to hire as many as 1,000 midwives and around 80 consultant obstetricians.",
      "Some of the money was also to be spent on allowing consultants and midwives to train together - a key recommendation of the initial report, by senior midwife Donna Ockenden - as well as allocating money for the NHS to recruit from overseas.",

      "The rest of the money will be given to the 42 Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) that decide how the health service funding is allocated locally across England.",
      "Responding to the change, Ms Ockenden posted on social media: \"How has this happened? So disappointed. Talking to colleagues across perinatal services, the sense of disappointment is profound.\"",
      "If the ICBs decide to spend the money they've been allocated on maternity care, there won't be a funding cut.",

    "story": [
      "The government has defended its net-zero policies after Sir Tony Blair said limiting fossil fuels was \"doomed to fail\" and a new approach was needed.",
      "The ex-Labour prime minister argued the climate change debate had become \"irrational\" and people in rich countries no longer wanted to make financial sacrifices \"when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "His comments have been seized on by opposition parties as an attack on Sir Keir Starmer's plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050.",
      "Asked about the comments at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: \"If you look at the detail of what Tony Blair said he's absolutely aligned with what we're doing here.\"",
      "Labour ministers have insisted the drive to net zero will not involve any financial sacrifices and have minimal impact on people's lives.",
      "Minutes before PMQs, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) issued a statement saying they \"support the government's 2050 net zero targets\" and that the UK government's approach is \"the right one\".",
      "Questioned whether the institute had been asked by the government to issue a clarification to help defuse a growing political row, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"I won't get into private conversations.\"",
      "Sir Keir's spokesman also stressed that the PM had confidence in Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, adding that he was \"doing a great job\".",
      "But he said the PM did not agree with Sir Tony that there was too much \"hysteria\" in the climate change debate.",
      "He told reporters: \"I don't think so, I mean I think we're taking a very practical and pragmatic approach to this here in the UK.\"",
      "He added: \"Our approach to net zero is clear. It is families up and down this country that will pay the price for the UK's dependence on fossil fuel markets.\"",
      "Nicholas Stern - who wrote an influential report on the economics of climate change for Tony Blair when he was in government in 2006 - described the report from the Tony Blair Institute as \"muddled and misleading\".",
      "He said there was \"far more progress being made around the world to decarbonise the global economy than it suggests\" and that it did not take account of the UK's leadership in the field.",
      "\"If the UK wobbles on its route to net zero, other countries may become less committed. The UK matters,\" said Prof Stern, who chairs the Grantham Research institute on climate change at the London School of Economics.",
      "The TBI report argues that the expected global rise in fossil fuel use and the doubling of airline travel over the next 20 years undermines current climate policies.",
      "\"These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail,\" Sir Tony wrote in the foreward to the report.",
      "The report says existing carbon targets should be kept in place to give certainty to business but a rethink of how they are achieved was urgently needed.",
      "It says the focus should instead be on emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage and nuclear fusion - and new international efforts to persuade the world's biggest economies, such as China and India, to cut their emissions.",
      "To help achieve the 2050 target, Labour and the previous Conservative government made a series of pledges including \"clean\" electricity, ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and installing 600,000 electric heat pumps a year by 2028.",

      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins said there was \"consensus across the board\" on the need to protect the environment, but that \"we have to take the public with us\".",
      "And she said Sir Tony had sent a \"clear message\" to the government that it needs to \"rethink\" its approach to net zero.",
      "In a sign of the acrimony swilling around this debate within Labour, one government source suggested Sir Tony's comments may have been affected by the Tony Blair Institute having received funding from oil rich Saudi Arabia.",
      "The TBI says it is \"editorially independent\".",
      "The Labour Party has had a complicated relationship with Sir Tony and his legacy since he left Downing Street in 2007.",
      "Ed Miliband's election as leader in 2010 over his brother, David, was seen in part as a repudiation of Blairism, as was Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to a much greater extent.",
      "But since Sir Keir Starmer became leader in 2020 he has often embraced the most electorally-successful leader in Labour's history. He has also hired some of the leading figures from Sir Tony's Downing Street.",
      "Jonathan Powell, Downing Street chief of staff under Sir Tony, is now Sir Keir's national security adviser, and Liz Lloyd, a former deputy chief of staff, is now back as director of policy delivery.",

      "In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "The judges said trans people are still protected from discrimination under equalities legislation, and that this interpretation of the law does not cause disadvantage to the \"potentially vulnerable group\".",

They argued, for example, it is impossible for services - from police officers performing a strip search through to restaurants - to truly specify someone's biology, pointing to intersex cases as an example of where biological sex is not binary.",
      "The Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a long-running legal battle brought by campaign group For Women Scotland, which had argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. The group had argued that women felt unsafe with trans women using female facilities.",
      "Mahmood told the committee the Supreme Court had \"handled things very sensitively\".",
      "She said the judges have \"done their job and I think they've sought to do it in a way that recognises that we're talking about a balance of rights but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections from discrimination\".",

      "Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of breaking its promise to set up five local inquiries into grooming gangs despite pledging to do so.",
      "The Conservative leader said Sir Keir Starmer had promised \u00a35m to fund five locally-led investigations into grooming gangs but delivered just one, in Oldham.",
      "During Prime Ministers Questions, Badenoch suggested Sir Keir was \"dragging his heels\" on inquiries to shield Labour-run councils from scandal.",

      "Ministers have been facing growing demands to reveal which areas are running grooming gang inquires alongside the review in Oldham, and a three-month audit of national evidence being led by government troubleshooter Baroness Louise Casey.",
      "Earlier this month Tom Crowther, the barrister helping to develop the schemes, suggested local inquiries into grooming gangs had stalled since they were announced in January.",
      "Crowther, who chaired the inquiry into child sex abuse in Telford, Shropshire, gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs Committee at the start of April and told MPs he had asked a government official \"do you still want me?\"",
      "The issue was again raised in the Commons on Monday, when Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips told MPs she expected there to be more than five local inquires.",

      "Badenoch repeatedly asked Sir Keir for an update on the local inquires. When he did not respond, she said he \"cannot name a single place because nothing is happening\".",
      "She questioned whether the prime minister was \"dragging his heels\" on local inquiries into grooming gangs because he \"doesn't want Labour cover-ups exposed\", adding that the inquiries hadn't started because \"local authorities don't want to investigate themselves\".",
      "A national inquiry was needed as local probes \"cannot force witnesses to appear\" and \"cannot force people to give evidence under oath\", Badenoch said.",
      "Sir Keir accused Badenoch of \"staying silent\" on the issue in government while he \"oversaw the first grooming gang prosecution\" as Director of Public Prosecutions.",
      "He told the Commons: \"I was the prosecutor who brought the first case.",
      "\"On the back of that I then changed the entire approach to prosecutions, which was then lauded by the government that we were doing the right thing, and brought those prosecutions.\"",
      "In contrast to the Conservatives, Labour were \"implementing existing recommendations\" of the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse and \"providing for local inquiries\", he said.",

      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "The Conservative have been calling for a second national inquiry into grooming gangs since the issue was thrust back into the spotlight by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the start of the year.",
      "The proposal was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour figures including Rotherham MP Sarah Champion alongside Labour mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords, Labour's Baroness Hazarika offered an apology on behalf of the Muslim community for the \"sickening, despicable, wicked acts\" of child grooming gangs.",
      "She said that many people in Muslim community were as appalled as anyone else, telling peers: \"This is not who we are\", and added that many of the men were abusing Muslim women as well as white women.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for the the government to focus on implementing all 20 of the recommendations made by the Jay inquiry.",
      "On Monday, party spokesperson Lisa Smart said MPs \"owe it to\" victims to not just \"offer words of support, but to deliver justice and bring offenders to account\".",
      "Reform UK have backed calls for a national inquiry and have previously offered to fund their own.",
      "Party leader Nigel Farage has previously accused both Labour and Tories of \"failing to bring justice to the thousands of victims across multiple decades of these horrific crimes\".",

    "story": [
      "The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.",
      "In a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is \"either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction\".",
      "From hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.",
      "In response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed.",
      "Floods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was \"something we're really committed to\".",
      "\"We are putting \u00a32.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.",
      "\"But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.\"",
      "Fuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.",
      "Such events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.",
      "Better preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.",
      "\"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.",
      "\"The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,\" she added.",
      "\"We've heard some warm words\u2026 but nothing has come out yet.\"",

      "These are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.",
      "Health is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.",
      "The CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.",
      "Baroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.",
      "This meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.",
      "\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.",
      "\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"",
      "Flooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.",
      "The ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.",
      "Polly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.",
      "\"It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,\" she said.",
      "\"[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.\"",
      "The main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods.",
      "Shop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.",
      "And the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of flood protection for the town.",
      "The government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.",
      "The CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.",
      "'A huge mistake'",
      "At the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.",
      "But putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be \"a huge mistake\" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.",
      "\"We are very worried about their spending review,\" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.",
      "\"This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.\"",
      "A freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "That's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.",

      "The patchwork of different election results across England has been truly fascinating, throwing up all sorts of lessons.",
      "Here are seven things we have learnt from the contests:",
      "These are really bad results for the Labour Party",
      "Sometimes in politics what is most obvious is most important. These are a bad set of results for the Labour Party at their first electoral test since being swept to office ten months ago in a landslide of epic proportions.",
      "\"We did it!\" the prime minister told his jubilant supporters back then as seat after seat fell to Labour, adding: \"It feels good, I have to be honest.\"",
      "That's not so much the vibe these days.",
      "Leaving the eight-hour count after the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, Labour campaigners were utterly dejected, not least at having lost by only six votes, the closest result in any by-election ever.",
      "Yet even if they had won by six votes, the trend would have been the same -  a governing party which has burnt through goodwill at an unimaginable pace.",
      "It's possible to overstate how dramatic the contrast with the 2024 general election is, though.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer's victory was broad but shallow, his 411 seats procured on just over a third of the vote. Perhaps it's not surprising that the so-called loveless landslide has been followed by a rude awakening.",
      "Labour's debate on what to do next is just beginning",
      "\"On every door it was the same story - winter fuel and Pip.\"",
      "That's what a Labour campaigner in Runcorn told me, referring to the early decision this government made to means-test the winter fuel allowance and the more recent announcement that eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment will be tightened.",
      "Speaking to Labour MPs from different wings of the party over the course of the day, it's been surprising how many have pretty much stuck to that same theme. For almost all of them, the original sin of this government was the decision on winter fuel.",
      "There are nuances within that position. Some believe the cut could have been communicated better, making the case that some pensioners were receiving the benefit who simply didn't need it. Others think it was never worth the political risk for the amount of money it would raise.",
      "To stress, it is not just the left of the Labour Party, comprised of a handful of MPs willing to criticise Starmer publicly, who are saying this. I had a conversation with an MP on the right of the party who believes the situation is so dire, the damage so fundamental, that Rachel Reeves should simply reverse the cut.",
      "That is extremely unlikely. But it is where the debate may be headed when MPs return to the Commons and compare notes next week.",
      "And of course a crucial part of that debate is the parlous economic situation inherited by the government which, those around the prime minister insist, necessitated unpleasant decisions which were always bound to be unpopular. If it had not been winter fuel, it would have been something else \u2013 the argument goes.",
      "The consolation of sorts for Labour is that fixing their political predicament is in their hands. They are the government and the levers of power are at their command. The next general election is up to four years away. All in Labour agree that people need to be made to feel better off - and they hope that if that can be achieved, the political challenges melt away.",
      "For the Conservatives, things are somehow getting worse",
      "Turns out the only way wasn't up. The Conservatives were reduced to their fewest MPs ever last July. That annihilation is now being visited on their local politicians.",
      "Kemi Badenoch took charge of a crushed Conservative Party and has only had six months to begin trying to turn things round. Still, I am yet to meet a Conservative who will sincerely argue that she has made a good start.",
      "I have, though, lost count of Conservative MPs and advisers who say to me that, in a funny way, they need Labour to be doing better. The Conservatives are still tarnished in many voters' eyes by their governing record, meaning that the receptacle for voters' immediate frustration with Labour, in Runcorn and elsewhere, is Reform UK.",
      "But it's more than just a story about the government's woes, as longstanding Conservative strongholds such as Staffordshire and Lincolnshire falling to Reform show. Some of the results simply need to be stated to see how startling they are.",
      "Conservatives had run Staffordshire County Council since 2009. They had 56 of the 62 councillors on Thursday morning. Now they have only 10.",
      "The Lib Dems have taken dozens of seats from the Tories. They have pushed the party into third place in this set of elections. Leader Sir Ed Davey is claiming to have seized the title of the party of \"Middle England\".",
      "There does not seem to be any appetite at all in the Conservative Party to even begin a conversation about changing leader yet again. Robert Jenrick throwing his support behind the woman who beat him to the leadership was a significant moment.",
      "Whoever is leader, a Conservative Party performing at this level is a Conservative Party in an existential crisis.",
      "'Not Labour enough': MPs' despair at voters' verdict on government",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "For Reform, with victory comes responsibility",
      "It's hard to come up with the right superlatives for Nigel Farage's political achievement. Suffice to say the Reform surge evident in opinion polling has turned out to be real.",
      "Yes, under Farage's leadership Ukip won the European elections in 2014 and the Brexit Party did the same in 2019.",
      "Their success in five constituencies at the general election - including Farage himself finally making it into parliament at the eighth attempt - suggested Reform UK was something different to his previous incarnations. That is surely now proven beyond all reasonable doubt.",
      "Reform has now won control of ten councils, and with victory comes responsibility.",
      "When Ukip ran up victories in the European elections, its mandate was to scrutinise the Brussels institutions its voters loathed.",
      "Now its mandate is to make its own voters' lives better. That is a different task. The traditional main parties will be hoping that following responsibility comes accountability, and that if Reform councils and mayors fail, the party's brand will suffer.",
      "It's not just Reform benefitting from the main parties' unpopularity",
      "The Liberal Democrats have made solid gains across what was once traditional Tory territory, which is essentially local politics catching up with what happened at the general election last July.",
      "In Devon they gained 18 council seats, mostly at the Conservatives' expense, to become the largest party, and have won control of Oxfordshire, Shropshire and Cambridgeshire.",
      "They are ecstatic to have leapfrogged the Conservatives into third place in the BBC's Projected National Share.",
      "The Greens are making gains too, although their failure to win or even come second in the West of England mayoral contest will sting. The battle between the Greens and Labour for younger, urban progressives is likely to come to the fore in future local elections.",
      "Whoever is the change candidate wins",
      "Labour's general election slogan was just one word: change. No wonder that it appeared at the start of new MP Sarah Pochin's victory speech in Runcorn too.",
      "If there's one thing every politician and strategist from every party seems to agree on, it is that people are crying out for things to be better. In other words, for change.",
      "It was the mantle Keir Starmer managed to seize in opposition. His challenge is to reclaim it while being in government.",
      "The task facing each opposition party in their different ways is to stop him doing so and convince voters that they have the best shot of improving their lives.",

      "Who won the local election in my area?",
      "Sir John Curtice: Reform challenging traditional party dominance",
      "The era of fragmentation is here...at least for now",
      "The two-party double act which has governed Britain for a century appears to be under massive strain. It may be time to get used to elections in this country - parliamentary, mayoral, council - being won on low shares of the vote by very fine margins. Under our First Past The Post system (where the winner is simply the person with the most votes), if you have lots of parties with relatively even support, things can get really unpredictable.",
      "Yet if there's another lesson of British politics in recent years it's that politics is volatile. The death of the two-party system has been pronounced before. At the 2010 general election, Labour and the Conservatives only got 65% of the vote combined. By 2017 that figure was back up to 82%. In 2024 it was back to 57%. Things can change fast in politics - they have done, again and again.",
      "As politics begins to move at social media speed, who's to say Reform cannot fall away as fast as they rose?",
      "It's a counter-argument worth bearing in mind. On the other hand, it is no longer preposterous to say that Nigel Farage could be the next prime minister.",
      "The range of possible political futures which could unfold in the UK over the next few years is simply vast. Anyone who tells you what is going to happen next needs a whopping great dose of humility.",

      "Though some of the results are still to be reported, Reform are clearly the winners of Thursday's local elections.",
      "Across the 23 councils where a ballot was held, the party won more votes and more seats than any of its opponents by a clear margin. The party is probably heading for around 700 seat gains and won two mayoral contests.",
      "Meanwhile, it has won overall control of no less than seven councils, including the once Labour fiefdom of Durham and the two largest counties,  Kent and Lancashire.",
      "The party performed best in wards which voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum. Yet even in places which voted to remain in the EU, the party was still routinely able to win as much as a fifth of the vote.",

      "In the BBC's projection of what would have happened if a nationwide election had been held on Thursday, Reform were credited with 30% of the vote. That easily beats the 23% that Ukip scored at the height of their popularity in 2013. It is the first time that a party other than Conservative or Labour has been placed first.",
      "Meanwhile, Reform also won the Runcorn by-election, albeit by the narrowest of margins. Never before has a pro-Brexit party candidate won a by-election, other than two local Tory MPs who defected to Ukip in 2014.",
      "For both the Conservatives and Labour the result was worse than their spokespersons feared. The Conservatives lost two in three of the seats they were defending and at best are likely to be left with control of just one council, Buckinghamshire.",
      "In a clear indication of the Conservatives' vulnerability to the challenge from Nigel Farage's party, its vote fell most heavily in places where the Reform advance was strongest. Their score in the BBC projection is by far a record low.",
      "Labour also lost two in three of the seats they were defending, though it had the consolation of winning three mayoral elections, albeit only by a narrow margin. Their projected share is the lowest since 2008, when the party suffered from the financial crash and the MPs' expenses scandal.",
      "In contrast, the Liberal Democrats were able to withstand the Reform tide, recording over 100 net gains. The party was particularly successful in councils that it had targeted, most notably Devon and Shropshire. Overall, however, the party's performance in votes was largely in line with that of other recent local elections. Much the same was true of the Greens, who made a modest gain of 38 seats.",

    "summary": "The ex-Tory MP has been elected as the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, marking a return to politics.",
    "story": [
      "Dame Andrea Jenkyns has been elected as the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, giving the party she represents, Reform UK, its most powerful office to date.",
      "In her victory speech, she declared it was a \"new dawn in British politics\" and vowed Reform would \"reset Britain to its glorious past\".",
      "She beat the Conservative candidate by more than 40,000 votes, which will feel like like a personal vindication for the former Tory MP.",
      "But she showed she had lost none of her talent for generating controversy when she walked out on a Sky News interview after being asked about her view that illegal migrants should be \"put in tents\" and criticisms of her Tory opponent's South African accent.",
      "A former Greggs worker and Miss UK finalist, Dame Andrea will now control an annual budget of \u00a324m and hold powers over skills, transport and economic development in the region.",
      "The result marks a remarkable political comeback for an MP voted out less than a year ago in the general election.",
      "But as Dame Andrea's meandering political career shows, she has form for bouncing back from crushing disappointments with attention-grabbing election wins.",
      "Shock election triumph",
      "It all started in 2009, when she won a seat on Lincolnshire County Council, narrowly defeating the far-right British National Party's candidate.",
      "The result did not stand for long though. She was forced to resign after it emerged her part-time job as a music tutor for a council-run music service made her ineligible to run as a candidate.",
      "A by-election was held and Jenkyns squeaked home by 16 votes, again ahead of the BNP.",
      "Four years on, she lost her council seat to UKIP, a Eurosceptic party founded by Nigel Farage - Reform UK's leader and, ironically, now Dame Andrea's boss.",
      "Two years passed before her next comeback in 2015, when she burst onto the national scene with one of the biggest shocks of the general election that year.",
      "She ousted shadow chancellor Ed Balls, winning the Morley and Outwood constituency by 422 votes and knocking a brick out of Labour's red wall.",
      "Jenkyns - who worked at a Greggs bakery after leaving school at 16 - said she was \"lost for words\".",
      "In her campaign, she presented herself as a \"strong Yorkshire lass\" from humble beginnings.",
      "Born in Humberside in 1974, Jenkyns went straight into a job after finishing school, working her way up from a Saturday shop assistant to senior management.",
      "An amateur opera singer and a vocal coach, she also worked as a music tutor in secondary schools.",
      "When she hit her 30s, she decided to retrain and completed a diploma in economics from the Open University before graduating from the University of Lincoln aged 40 after studying international relations and politics.",
      "Her father was a lorry driver with his own haulage business.",
      "He pushed her towards the limelight at an early age, entering her in the Miss UK beauty contest.",
      "\"My dad sent my photo off without telling me and I ended up getting into the final,\" she told the Express newspaper.",
      "\"It was an interesting moment.\"",
      "Her father's death in 2011 - after he contracted the MRSA infection in hospital - spurred her to run for Parliament.",
      "Brexit backer",
      "As an MP, Jenkyns was a passionate Brexit backer and a strong critic of Theresa May's handling of the UK's departure from the EU when she was prime minister.",
      "In a striking intervention at Prime Minister's Questions, Jenkyns said May had \"failed to deliver on her promises\" and suggested she should resign.",
      "Once May had stood aside, Jenkyns found favour with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed her as an assistant government whip in 2021 and a junior education minister a year later.",
      "A loyal ally, Jenkyns consistently defended Johnson, including during her appearance on the BBC's Have I Got News For You programme, when she described him as \"one of our better prime ministers\".",
      "When Johnson resigned in 2022, Jenkyns lost her composure outside Downing Street.",
      "She was filmed giving the middle finger to protesters shortly before Johnson's resignation.",
      "A backlash followed and in her defence, Jenkyns said she was \"only human\" and had received \"huge amounts of abuse from some of the people who were there over the years\".",
      "\"I responded and stood up for myself,\" she said.",
      "She was made a dame in Johnson's resignation honours in 2023.",
      "Jenkyns retained her ministerial role under Liz Truss but was later dismissed by the following prime minister, Rishi Sunak.",
      "She then failed to win re-election to the successor seat of Leeds South West and Morley at the 2024 general election.",
      "Bouncing back with Reform",
      "Back in the political wilderness, Jenkyns began flirting with Reform UK last year.",
      "Dame Andrea had made clear her sympathies with Nigel Farage's party, urging the Conservatives to unite with it to prevent a Labour \"supermajority\" at the general election.",
      "Attending Reform UK's conference last autumn, Dame Andrea insisted she was \"not defecting\" but was keen to find out whether Farage's party was \"the true home of conservatism\".",
      "Two months later, Jenkyns announced she was officially joining Reform UK and would stand as the party's candidate to be mayor of Greater Lincolnshire.",
      "Dame Andrea said she had \"fought to the bitter end\" but the Conservative Party was now \"beyond salvage\".",
      "Twelve years on from her defeat to Farage's former party in a local election in Lincolnshire, Jenkyns has delivered a significant electoral victory for her former foe.",
      "Back in the county where it all began, the new mayor has once again proved her bouncebackability.",

      "Is Welsh Labour facing a turning point as we approach a year to go until the Senedd election?",
      "Feelings behind the scenes that UK Labour does not get the fight that the party in Wales will face at the ballot box are starting to spill over.",
      "Whether they spill over into 'clear red water' - a phrase coined at the start of the century to describe how the Welsh party differentiated itself from its Westminster colleagues - remains to be seen.",
      "The First Minister, Eluned Morgan, told the Senedd on Tuesday that she will be making a speech next week to outline her position \"more clearly\" on the UK Labour government's welfare reforms \u2013 a controversial issue in Wales, where claimant levels are high.",
      "We do not know how far she will go, or whether she will dip her toe into other areas.",
      "She has plenty to choose from, with decisions made at Westminster affecting steel, welfare, rail funding, crown estate and National Insurance all proving controversial and very current issues.",
      "If she was minded to a year to go until an election, which takes place on 7 May 2026, seems as good a time as any for the first minister to deal with Westminster decisions which she worries might cost Welsh voters and cost her votes.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon BBC Wales saw a copy of a letter the FM has sent to the business secretary in Westminster outlining her concerns about the steel industry.",
      "Eluned Morgan is calling on Jonathan Reynolds to \"ringfence\" a significant amount of a \u00a32.5bn UK government steel fund for Wales.",
      "There are worries that the money will be used to keep the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe \u2013 rescued by the UK government \u2013 burning instead.",

      "Tata -the owners of Port Talbot \u2013 are investing in a joint venture with the UK government to build a new electric arc furnace there.",
      "The letter can be seen two ways \u2013 it makes the case for Wales' share of that funding, but also plays into what might be a narrative of the FM trying to differentiate herself from her colleagues in London, or stand up to them.",

      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

      "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.",
      "Animals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.",
      "But a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.",
      "It has been moved to Germany where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.",
      "This week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.",
      "Two days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.",
      "\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"",
      "Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.",
      "Though not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food.",
      "Once native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction.",
      "\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.",
      "It was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx.",
      "The lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring.",
      "\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.",
      "To combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind.",
      "But last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.",
      "So Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.",
      "\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo.",
      "Over the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.",
      "\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.",

      "\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.",
      "The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.",

    "story": [
      "A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge.",
      "But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito.",
      "The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date.",
      "More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem.",
      "The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project.",
      "Midge bite or a mosquito?",
      "University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible.",
      "Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people.",
      "Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project.",
      "After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home.",
      "While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year.",
      "The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds.",
      "Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\".",
      "She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before.",
      "\"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\"",
      "In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath.",
      "Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.",
      "She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits \u2013 understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects.",
      "\"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes \u2013 proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects.",
      "\"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\"",
      "Is malaria a risk?",
      "Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.",
      "However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.",
      "It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.",
      "Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.",
      "Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.",
      "The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.",
      "The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.",
      "Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks.",

    "story": [
      "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered.",
      "In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City.",
      "The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\".",
      "The findings are published in the journal PLoS One and they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat.",
      "The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians.",
      "But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild.",
      "\"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.",
      "It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.",
      "\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"",
      "To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,",
      "The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".",
      "Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device.",
      "\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"",
      "The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained.",
      "Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically.",
      "But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover.",
      "\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people.",
      "\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\""

      "He also says that politicians are more divided than everyone else.",
      "\"The fracturing of the consensus has been far more profound at what we'd call 'elite level' rather than at public level,\" he says.",
      "Undoubtedly, part of the rise in the conversation about climate targets has been driven by the rise of Reform, which has made what it calls \"net stupid zero\" one of its major campaign issues.",
      "Deputy leader Richard Tice says his party - which has just won a by-election and made major gains in local elections - has forced the issue onto the political agenda.",
      "\"On the doors, people are talking about immigration but the next thing they talk about is the price of everything, the bills, the cost of living. When you drill into it, the message is getting across that the increase in the cost of living is significantly due to the increase in energy costs.",
      "\"The awareness of the stupidity of this has transformed in the last six months, because of the destruction of jobs and bills. People are waking up all over the place.\"",
      "For the Green Party of England and Wales Co-Leader, Adrian Ramsay, the fracturing of consensus is \"distressing\" and he blames party politics.",
      "\"There are parts of the political spectrum that are determined to turn this into a political football but I think reasonable people within all parties need to resist.\"",
      "He says people do need to feel they are included in climate measures and believes there is a \"sensible climate majority\" within Parliament, whose job it is to make the right policies to bring people along with them.",
      "\"Of course it has to be done in a way that brings people with us and there is a risk that there's too much onus put on individuals so when it comes to things like public transport, for instance....the greener option needs to be the cheaper option.\"",
      "There are also those that think the UK is starting to import the more partisan politics on the issue from the US.",
      "Pippa Heylings, the Liberal Democrats' net zero spokesperson, says she thinks part of the pushback is being driven by \"big oil and gas\" who, she says, have been \"emboldened by Donald Trump\".",

      "Her party's policy is currently to reach net zero by 2045 although she says they are looking at it to make sure it is still \"do-able\" after the previous Conservative administration shifted the government's timeline.",
      "The most marked political shift has come from the Conservatives, who have moved from setting the 2050 target, enthusiastically embracing green goals set by Boris Johnson, to a slowing of some targets under Rishi Sunak and, finally, abandoning 2050 under Kemi Badenoch.",
      "She has described the 2050 plans as \"impossible\" and said that what Keir Starmer needed to do was to \"scrap what [Energy Secretary] Ed Miliband is planning which is actually going to bankrupt the country\".",
      "\"It's not workable. Conservatives are working on new plans so that we can tackle climate change and look after our environment, without bankrupting the UK.\"",
      "Green-minded Tories have said they thought the decision to ditch the target was premature but they hope their party will recommit to decarbonisation.",
      "Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, said: \"On the centre-right there have been growing concerns around the cost of the transition and the shift to a more statist, interventionist approach to decarbonising.\"",
      "He says he wants to see a more \"market-led\" solution.",
      "While much of the Labour Party does seem to be on board with the leadership's position, there are some in the broader Labour movement who have issued warning shots that suggest their support for net zero is conditional.",
      "Some trade unions have become increasingly vocal about the need to ensure that there is a plan to protect jobs in any transition to green energy.",
      "As the union Unite put it: \"If they fail to do this, then Labour cannot expect workers to support their net zero plan.\"",
      "While the net zero by 2050 target is currently set in law, Labour's \"clean power by 2030\" push is self-imposed, leading to regular rumours that it could be watered down.",
      "Government sources are adamant the party is committed to it, and they point to investments that have already been made.",
      "Other Labour sources, who back the targets, say they believe the prime minister is invested in it and that it is intrinsically linked to the government's growth agenda.",
      "They also warn that any watering down of targets would shake confidence in foreign investment.",
      "Former Labour advisor John McTernan believes that keeping the clean power commitment is also key to the government's political survival beyond the next election.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:27:52 GMT",
    "summary": "The new satellite will be able to see through clouds and forest canopies.",
    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "Perhaps none more so than Andrew Brown - a cybersecurity lecturer by day, with a side hustle as a self-made amateur weather forecaster.",
      "Few know that Mr Brown is the brains behind Wally's Weather - a Facebook page with 107,000 followers and 24 million monthly views, focusing on weather across the tropical state of Queensland.",
      "During the record-breaking flooding, when 400 people were forced to evacuate their homes, Mr Brown published round the clock posts, even waking in the night to share updates, out of a sense of duty and responsibility to his audience.",
      "He even left work early when he spotted on his weather radar that five hours of non-stop rain would be approaching, advising not just his Facebook followers, but his bosses, colleagues, wife and adult children to do the same.",
      "\"When there's a big weather event, you try and give people as much notice as possible.\"",
      "He is based in Townsville, the regional centre of an area known for a rain-drenched, hot, humid wet season from January to March.",
      "\"People want to know what's going on, because even if they lose power, they've probably still got an internet connection. These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.",
      "Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.",
      "People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.",
      "Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.",
      "Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.",
      "\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.",
      "\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.",
      "\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"",
      "Yet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.",
      "In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.",
      "Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.",
      "\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.",
      "\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.",
      "\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"",
      "It's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.",
      "Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.",
      "But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.",
      "\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.",
      "\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.",
      "\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"",
      "While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.",
      "His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.",
      "The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.",
      "Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.",
      "Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.",
      "\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.",
      "Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.",
      "\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "\"The opposition has been shambolic,\" Prof Warhurst says.",
      "But the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.",
      "And that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.",
      "While the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.",

      "Albanese's \"incumbency curse\" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.",
      "Labor struck a \"middle-of-the-road path\" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.",

    "summary": "Romania's previous presidential election was cancelled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference.",
    "story": [
      "Romanians are trying again to elect a new president, six months after the first attempt ended in scandal and confusion.",
      "A radical outsider with mystical leanings, Calin Georgescu, came first on 24 November, but that result was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference.",
      "In February, US Vice President JD Vance sharply criticised Romania for that decision, sending shockwaves through a Romanian political establishment which leans heavily on its special relationship with the US.  Georgescu was nevertheless barred from taking part in today's rerun.",
      "This election pits a nationalist, George Simion, leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), against three centrists: the popular mayor of Bucharest Nicusor Dan; Crin Antonescu, a liberal who represents the governing Social-Democrat and National Liberal coalition; and Elena Lasconi, an independent.",
      "Seven other candidates are on the ballot paper. If no candidate wins over 50% of the vote, a run-off between the first two candidates will be held on 18 May.",
      "\"This election is not about one candidate or another, but about every Romanian who has been lied to, ignored, humiliated, and still has the strength to believe and defend our identity and rights,\" Simion posted on X on Friday.",
      "Opinion polls - notoriously unreliable in Romania - suggest that he will come first today, then will face a tough contest with either Nicusor Dan or Crin Antonescu in the run-off.",
      "The result is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. The country has a US missile defence shield at Deveselu, and three major airbases from which Nato flies air policing missions up to the border of Ukraine and Moldova, and out over the Black Sea.",
      "Ukraine exports 70% of its grain down the Black Sea coast, through Romanian territorial waters, towards Istanbul. The Romanian navy demines those waters, and the Romanian air force trains Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. A visa-waiver agreement was abruptly cancelled on the eve of the election.",
      "\"Forget about any more help to Ukraine if Simion becomes president,\" says George Scutaru, a security expert at the New Strategy Center in Bucharest. As head of the National Security Council, the president can veto any decision, and has a strong influence on security policy. But Scutaru expresses \"prudent optimism\" that one of the centrists will win the run-off.",
      "Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian.",
      "On a baking May afternoon, crowds of sightseers throng the gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence in the west of Bucharest. The decision by interim President Ilie Bolojan to open the buildings and gardens to the public is very popular among the visitors.",
      "White and purple irises line the paths beneath ancient horse chestnuts in full flower. A military band marches among flowerbeds of pansies and violets. The palace is a former monastery, converted in the 17th century, which became home to the Romanian royal family in the 19th century.",
      "\"I can't really imagine Simion in here\u2026\" Ionut, a satirical writer, tells me beside an ornate waterfall, looking up at the palace walls. He voted for Simion in the first round of the election last November, out of anger at the constant delays to Romania's full membership of the Schengen free-travel zone. And frustration with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis.",
      "But Romania finally joined the Schengen land-borders on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month. \"Romanians are less angry now,\" he believes. He told his daughter he will vote for Nicusor Dan in this election, but hasn't quite made up his mind.",
      "Ana, a management consultant, walking with her family through the palace gardens, also supports Nicusor Dan. \"I want to vote for both continuity and change,\" she says. \"Continuity in Romania's relationship with Europe, but change as far as corruption is concerned. We young people don't relate to the old parties any more,\" - something Nicusor Dan has in common with Simion.",
      "Many in Romania's large diaspora  - a million are registered to vote - have already cast their ballots, especially in Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK. They are invisible in opinion polls, and could easily sway the final result.",

    "summary": "The Swedish city Uppsala broke into party spirit this week - but the killing of hair salon customers still wearing their capes left many shaken.",
    "story": [
      "Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive.",
      "At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started.",
      "The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students.",
      "The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city.",
      "And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.",
      "'I knew something had happened'",
      "\"It's really sad,\" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. \"I think if I was there [on Tuesday]\u2026I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary.\"",
      "According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.",
      "The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats.",
      "Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene.",
      "\"I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,\" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay.",
      "Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion.",
      "However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.",
      "On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings.",
      "People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an \"isolated incident\".",
      "While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps.",
      "\"I don't really feel so scared,\" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. \"It feels like there's more security, more cops about.\"",
      "His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in G\u00e4vle, two hours north, to \"have fun and meet new people\".",
      "She reflects that she no longer has a \"strong\" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. \"There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.\"",
      "A hotspot for gun violence",
      "Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is \"increasingly younger\", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence.",
      "Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as \"an extremely violent act\".",
      "\"This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,\" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday.",
      "At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.",
      "Police in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.",
      "Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs.",
      "Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws.",
      "In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.",
      "Tributes and tears",
      "Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have.",
      "\"Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,\" he says. \"But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.\"",
      "As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly shaken and have tears in their eyes.",
      "\"I knew him very well,\" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the victims, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. \"It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has won by a landslide in an election dominated by concerns over the cost of living and the country's future economic stability.",
      "Led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his first election since he became party leader last year, the PAP clinched 65.6% of the vote and an overwhelming majority of the 97 seats in parliament.",
      "Singaporeans went to the polls on Saturday worrying about inflation, wage stagnation and job prospects.",
      "The result will be widely seen as a flight to safety to the PAP amid fears of global turbulence.",
      "\"Singapore feels particularly vulnerable given its economy's size and exposure to international forces\u2026 Also we are notoriously risk-averse voters,\" said Ian Chong, an associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).",
      "The main opposition, the centre-left Workers' Party (WP), failed to capture more seats but continued to hold on to its 10 seats in parliament.",
      "The centre-right PAP has governed Singapore continuously since 1959, making it one of the longest-ruling political parties in the world.",
      "It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have seen the country flourish under PAP rule.",
      "But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.",
      "In the last three polls prior to Saturday's result, the PAP saw two of its lowest-ever vote shares, while the WP made increasing inroads in parliament.",
      "The PAP won a reduced majority in the 2020 election, in what was seen as a referendum on their handling of the Covid outbreak.",
      "But Saturday's result saw the PAP return to form, as voters gave Wong a strong mandate.",
      "In a televised address early on Sunday, he thanked voters and said the results \"will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world\".",
      "\"Many are watching the election closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they would have taken note of tonight's results,\" he said.",
      "\"It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government. Singaporeans, too, can draw strength from this and look ahead to our future.\"",
      "While its open and globalised economy remains fairly buoyant, Singapore saw inflation surge in the last few years.",
      "The government has attributed this to external factors such as the Ukraine and Gaza wars and supply chain disruptions. Critics however say a controversial goods and services tax hike exacerbated it.",
      "With the US-China trade war under way and a 10% US tariff looming, authorities and experts have warned of shocks to the economy and possibly a technical recession.",
      "Against this backdrop, the PAP campaigned on a message of stability.",
      "Wong repeatedly promised that his team would \"steer Singapore through the storm\", while warning that if more opposition MPs were elected, he would lose capable ministers at a time when good governance was most needed.",
      "It was a message that resounded with many voters. One PAP supporter, a start-up owner who only wanted to be known as Amanda, told the BBC that her business has been affected with clients pausing some projects due to the economic climate.",
      "\"The headwinds are not great, there's a lot of uncertainty\u2026 I want a party with experience [running the government],\" she said.",
      "Though the PAP saw a series of scandals in recent years, including one involving a cabinet minister, this was hardly a talking point during the election period. Analysts said it was further from people's minds given more immediate concerns about the economy.",

      "US Vice-President JD Vance accused \"bureaucrats\" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio slammed the designation as \"tyranny in disguise\".",
      "In an unusual move, the foreign office directly replied to Rubio on X, writing: \"We have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped.\"",
      "The intelligence agency that made the classification found AfD's \"prevailing understanding of people based on ethnicity and descent\" goes against Germany's \"free democratic order\".",
      "The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.",
      "The agency, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Verfassungsschutz (BfV), had already classed the AfD as right-wing extremist in three eastern states where its popularity is highest. Now, that designation has been extended to the entire party.",

      "Joint party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was \"clearly politically motivated\" and a \"severe blow to German democracy\".",
      "Beatrix von Storch, the party's deputy parliamentary leader, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the designation was \"the way an authoritarian state, a dictatorship, would treat their parties\".",

      "\"This is democracy,\" it wrote, directly replying to the politician's X account.",
      "The post said the decision had been made after a \"thorough and independent investigation\" and could be appealed.",
      "\"We have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped,\" the statement concluded - a reference to Hitler's Nazi party and the Holocaust.",
      "JD Vance, who met Weidel in Munich nine days before the election and used a speech to the Munich Security Conference to show support for the AfD, said that \"bureaucrats\" were trying to destroy the party.",

      "The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, separated East and West Berlin for nearly 30 years during the Cold War.",
      "The new designation has reignited calls to ban the AfD ahead of a vote next week in the parliament, or Bundestag, to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor. He will be leading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 23:43:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday 7 May, life follows fiction when 134 cardinals begin the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave will take place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican will know the outcome until a plume of white smoke curls from its chimney, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave could unfold, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "Conclave to elect new pope to begin on 7 May, Vatican says",
      "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants will be \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the imminent election may be one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote have been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis's appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This adds a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "summary": "The makers of a video game that even impressed the French president tell the unusual tale of its development.",
    "story": [
      "In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, Guillaume Broche was like millions of others around the world.",
      "\"Bored in their job and wanting to do something different.\"",
      "Working for French gaming giant Ubisoft at the time, he had an idea for his own project - a role-playing game inspired by one of his childhood favourites, the classic Japanese series Final Fantasy.",
      "That would become Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 which, five years later, has become a sensation.",
      "It sold one million copies in just three days, topped Spotify viral charts with its soundtrack, and even won praise from French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "But one of the most remarkable things about it is the story of how it was made - a tale of random Reddit messages, \"massive luck\" and an unusual approach to game development.",
      "Expedition 33 is set in Lumiere, a fictional world overshadowed by a huge monolith bearing a glowing numeral on its face.",
      "Each year an entity known as The Paintress emerges and lowers the number by one, causing everyone of that age to vanish, and the game follows a group on a quest to destroy the mysterious being.",
      "It's an intriguing set-up for an epic tale, but the game's aesthetic, inspired by 19th-Century France, and its old-school turn-based battles also set it apart.",
      "But the conventional wisdom when Guillaume began was that players didn't want something like that.",
      "So, five years ago, he started to recruit people for his passion project, firing out messages on Reddit and online forums to potential colleagues.",
      "One of those who responded was Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, who was under lockdown in Australia at the time.",
      "\"I saw a post on Reddit by Guillaume asking for voice actors to record something for free for a demo,\" she says.",
      "\"I was like: 'I've never done that, it sounds kinda cool', so I sent him an audition.\"",
      "Jennifer was originally cast as a major character in an early version of the game, but eventually switched roles to become the team's lead writer.",
      "Guillaume eventually left Ubisoft and formed Sandfall Interactive to work on Clair Obscur full-time from its base in Montpellier, France.",
      "After securing funding from publisher Kepler Interactive, the core team grew to about 30 people.",
      "Many of them were found in a similar, unusual manner to Jennifer.",
      "Composer Lorien Testard - who had never worked on a video game before - was discovered via posts on music-sharing website Soundcloud.",
      "\"I call this the Guillaume effect. He's very good at finding really cool people,\" says Jennifer.",
      "Guillaume more modestly attributes his success rate to Covid - people looking for a creative outlet - and also \"massive luck\".",
      "\"It's always the same story,\" he says.",
      "\"I have a list of 15 people to contact and I'm like: 'Okay I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all'.",
      "\"And every time the first one is like: 'Yeah, let's do it'.\"",
      "But Guillaume does admit that he targeted people who seemed to be \"in line with the direction\" he wanted to take the project.",
      "\"Lorien, when we discussed the game for the first time, we had exactly the same references,\" he says.",
      "\"We loved the same thing. We watched the same things. The discussion was so fluid.\"",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed until May 2026",
      "The Last of Us: Bella Ramsey talks season 2, autism, and growing up on screen",
      "Lost Records: 'It's OK to make games for different audiences'",
      "Expedition 33 has also been widely praised for its production values - rivalling those of games worked on by hundreds, even thousands of staff.",
      "Guillaume attributes some of this to recent advances in tools used to make games, which allowed the team to work more efficiently.",
      "Having the backing of Kepler allowed the studio to attract actors including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis, and video game actors Jennifer English and Ben Starr.",
      "And while Sandfall did call on extra input from support studios, musicians and other specialists, Jennifer and Guillaume say the core team ended up \"wearing a lot of different hats\".",
      "\"And so we all pitch in and do different parts, things that may be outside of our traditional role,\" says Jennifer, who was also in charge of translating the game into different languages.",
      "\"We have, I think, an amazing team mostly of junior people but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented,\" says Guillaume.",
      "\"Somehow it worked, which still makes no sense to me after all these years.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7x3v5d1y4o",
    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 23:26:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Western alliances unravel, Europe is entering an era that seems distant from what VE Day represented, the BBC's Katya Adler writes.",
    "story": [
      "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.",
      "The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.",
      "So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.",
      "But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.",
      "But is that accurate, or too simplistic?",
      "Russia - divisions from the start",
      "To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.",
      "By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.",
      "\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.",
      "\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"",
      "Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.",
      "Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.",
      "Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.",
      "But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.",
      "As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".",
      "\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.",
      "Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"",
      "Russia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.",
      "For VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.",
      "The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.",
      "That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.",
      "\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"",
      "The US - a marriage of convenience",
      "This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.",
      "Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.",
      "But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.",
      "Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.",
      "The idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.",
      "Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.",
      "\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.",
      "The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.",
      "Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.",
      "The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.",
      "A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.",
      "In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.",
      "If Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.",
      "And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.",
      "Germany decides to leave history in the past and rebuild its military",
      "How ordinary Poles are preparing for a Russian invasion",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.",
      "That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.",
      "The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, once German's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"",
      "'The end of an era' - but what now?",
      "Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.",
      "China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.",
      "Wittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".",
      "Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.",
      "Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".",
      "Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.",
      "Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities.",
      "This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.",
      "Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.",
      "\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.",
      "\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.",
      "\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"",
      "Eight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

    "summary": "The US singer says she feels \"bruised\" after weeks of online backlash - what's sparked the change?",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this week American singer Katy Perry, best known for her bubblegum pop, said she felt like a \"human Pi\u00f1ata\" after weeks of online backlash.",
      "The description felt suitably colourful - but the acknowledgement was serious. A decade on from headlining the Superbowl, Perry's part in a much-derided Blue Origin spaceflight has seen her star crash down to Earth.",
      "Mockery over the apparent worthiness of her reaction, including kissing the ground after landing and saying she felt \"so connected to love\", spread online. Fast food chain Wendy's even posted to ask: \"Can we send her back?\"",
      "Trolls have now taken aim at her world tour, which began in Mexico on 23 April, criticising her dance moves and performances.",
      "It seems the star who first broke through singing about a boyfriend's mood swings now faces an icy reception. Perry's blamed an \"unhinged and unhealed\" internet - but is toxic social media the only reason?",
      "'A pattern of failed reinvention'",
      "The music writer Michael Cragg, author of Reach for the Stars, believes Perry's problem is that she's stuck between pop cultures and feels increasingly out of touch.",
      "\"Her pop star persona was cemented in the 2010s as cartoon-y, fun and playful, all whipped cream bras and goofy videos where she wore oversized braces on her teeth,\" he says.",
      "For a period this worked. Her second album Teenage Dream, which doubled down on Perry's staple cheeky, sexualised girl-next-door image, scored five Billboard number one singles to match a record set by Michael Jackson. Its follow-up, 2013's Prism, bore transatlantic smash single Roar (her fourth solo UK number one), as well as Dark Horse in the US (her ninth domestically). Perry hasn't topped charts under her own steam since.",
      "\"That was a long time ago in pop terms and it feels like she hasn't evolved,\" adds Cragg.",
      "In the past year, her comeback single Woman's World, touted as a female empowerment anthem, struck critics as lyrically shallow.",
      "Some fans also seemed unimpressed that it was produced by Dr. Luke, who previously faced sexual assault allegations from the singer Kesha. The producer denied the claims and the pair reached an agreement to settle a defamation lawsuit in 2023, but Perry remained tainted by association.",
      "The track failed to land in the top 50 in the US and only just managed in the UK, at 47. \"Her sort of spiritual 'let love lead the way' messages she posts don't really hold sway with very online pop fans in the face of that decision,\" says Cragg.",
      "\"The regressive girl boss feel of Woman's World, and then the album not being great hasn't helped,\" he adds, pointing to rapper Doja Cat's success working with Dr. Luke without the same negative response.",
      "It followed a pattern of failed reinvention attempts stretching back to 2017's Witness, where Perry attempted to launch her socially conscious \"purposeful pop\" era.",
      "But its Sia-written lead single Chained to the Rhythm, which boldly attacked mindless pop culture, appeared to be undermined by Bon Appetit, a song openly objectifying Perry as a sexual meal.",
      "The 'pop girlie' has changed",
      "Female pop stardom has shifted. Last year's biggest breakout music stars \u2013 Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX \u2013 were women joined by a thread of fierce self-assurance, underpinned by relatability and authenticity.",
      "In contrast, Perry wanted distance from her pop persona - as the headline for Cragg's 2017 Guardian interview with her put it: \"I created this character called Katy Perry. I didn't want to be Katheryn Hudson. It was too scary.\"",
      "Perry's first hit I Kissed A Girl caused controversy for the fetishisation of lesbians even back in 2008 when it was released. But today Roan's had global success telling her genuine queer awakening.",
      "\"The flip flopping has jarred in an era where... very defined pop star personas are the ones cutting through,\" argues Cragg.",
      "Perry's 2021-2023 playground-styled Las Vegas residency embraced her surreal, fantastical image to commercial and critical success.",
      "But it's not translating to a new generation of fans. \"I think ultimately people see her as a bit cringeworthy now,\" Cragg adds. \"Being shot into space on a billionaire's jolly while everyone watches that on social media platforms interspersed with war and the climate crisis... just feels tonally not ideal,\" he says.",
      "Perry may have misjudged the public mood, but at the same time, the venom in the blowback points to deeper issues in pop culture beyond her control.",
      "There is no doubt that the social media landscape has become more frenzied in recent years, with stars like Roan speaking against toxic fandoms.",
      "Simon Diego, the creator of Brazil's Portal Katy Perry fan community, described the scale of the abuse towards the 40-year-old as \"unbelievable\".",
      "The group showed their support by clubbing together with other fan pages to pay for a digital billboard message in New York's Times Square for 24 hours.",
      "\"We're so proud of you and your magical journey and we love you to the moon and back,\" it read.",
      "\"Know that you are safe, seen and celebrated. We'll see you around the world, this is just the beginning.\"",
      "It was this that Perry replied to directly with her Pi\u00f1ata remark acknowledging the backlash.",
      "\"I think Katy and many other celebrities are feeling unsafe in the one space that used to connect them to fans,\" Diego tells BBC News.",
      "He believes that's why Perry has never posted photos of her daughter's face online.",
      "But even that boundary was ignored in the wake of the spaceflight criticism, as commenters began targeting her four-year-old child simply because \"it's cool now\", he says. \"They don't understand how bad it could affect her.\"",
      "Others, like Marie Claire Australia editor Georgie McCourt, think pervasive misogyny plays a part.",
      "\"There's a particular ire reserved for women like Perry: ambitious, unapologetic, hyper-visible,\" she wrote in a column, noting that male celebrities have already gone into space without such surveillant reaction.",
      "So where next for Perry? Cragg says a hit single would help.",
      "\"I'm not saying it will return her to the commercial highs of old, because that ship has sailed for a lot of pre-streaming artists, but it will steady the ship.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 00:25:01 GMT",
    "summary": "In his exclusive BBC interview, the Canadian Prime Minister indicates how he plans to tackle Trump.",
    "story": [
      "On Mark Carney's final day of a gruelling race to be elected PM of vast and sparsely populated Canada I was with him.",
      "It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his \"neighbour to the south\".",
      "For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something.",
      "I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline.",
      "While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell.",
      "Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: \"President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new reality\u2026 in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win\".",
      "His supporters shouted \"Elbows Up\" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey.",
      "\"What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...\"",
      "At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went \"unplugged\" among supporters.",
      "\"As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,\" Carney joked. \"So I'm going to govern in econometrics,\" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.",
      "In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.",
      "When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.",
      "Fighting threats to sovereignty",
      "Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's \"betrayal\" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.",
      "It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him.",
      "This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.",
      "The election result was staggering.",
      "Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls.",
      "Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide.",
      "But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened.",
      "Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.",
      "The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump.",
      "Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government.",
      "Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump.",
      "And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.",
      "Carney's strategy",
      "Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a \"win win\" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the \"biggest client\" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier.",
      "He also told me he \"potentially could supply them with critical minerals\". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere.",
      "Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.",
      "In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards.",
      "He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.",
      "On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 May 2025 03:15:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Buddha\u2019s sacred jewels, unearthed in 1898, head to auction at Sotheby\u2019s, raising ethical concerns.",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday, a cache of dazzling jewels linked to the Buddha's mortal remains, which have been hailed as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era, will go under the hammer at Sotheby's in Hong Kong.",
      "For over a century these relics, unearthed from a dusty mound in northern India in 1898, have sat largely unseen, cradled by a private British collection.",
      "Now, as the gems prepare to leave the custody of their keepers, they are stirring not just collectors' appetites but also some unease.",
      "They come from a glittering hoard of nearly 1,800 pearls, rubies, topaz, sapphires, and patterned gold sheets, first glimpsed deep inside a brick chamber in present-day Uttar Pradesh in India, near the Buddha's birthplace.",
      "Their discovery \u2013 alongside bone fragments identified by an inscribed urn as belonging to the Buddha himself \u2013 reverberated through the world of archaeology. Nicolas Chow, chairman of Sotheby's Asia and worldwide head of Asian Art, believes this is \"among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time\".",
      "Yet as these relics now face the glare of the auction room, experts tell the BBC that a question hangs heavy: can the sale of treasures so intimately woven into India's sacred past be considered ethical?",
      "In 1898, William Claxton Pepp\u00e9, an English estate manager, excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, where the Buddha is believed to have been born. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians agree these relics, intact until then, are the heritage of both the Buddha's Sakya clan descendants and Buddhists worldwide. The bone relics have since been distributed to countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where they continue to be venerated.",
      "\"Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?\" wonders Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian. \"And since they aren't, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them?",
      "\"Since the seller is termed the 'custodian', I would like to ask \u2013 custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9, great-grandson of William, told the BBC the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the \"fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists\".",
      "Julian King, Sotheby's international specialist and head of sale, Himalayan Art, New York told the BBC the auction house had made a thorough review of the jewels.",
      "\"As is the case with any important items and collectibles that are offered for sale at Sotheby's, we conducted requisite due diligence, including in relation to authenticity and provenance, legality and other considerations in line with our policies and industry standards for artworks and treasures,\" King said.",
      "Ashley Thompson, of Soas University of London, and curator Conan Cheong, both experts in Southeast Asian art, have more questions. In a joint statement they told the BBC: \"Other ethical questions raised by the sale are: should human remains be traded? And who gets to decide what are human remains or not? For many Buddhist practitioners around the world, the gems on sale are part and parcel of the bones and ash.\"",
      "The sale of the relics has also sparked concern among Buddhist leaders.",
      "\"The Buddha teaches us not to take other people's possessions without permission,\" Amal Abeyawardene of London-based British MahaBodhi Society, told the BBC. \"Historical records indicate that the Sakyamuni clan were granted custody of these relics, as the Buddha emanated from their community. Their wish was for these relics to be preserved alongside adornments, such as these gems, so that they may be venerated in perpetuity by the Buddha's followers.\"",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins. That's when he began researching their discovery by his great-grandfather.",
      "The Los Angeles-based television director and film editor wrote he had found 1898 newspaper reports - from Reuters to the New York Tribune - announcing the find of Buddha's remains.",
      "\"The colonisation of India by the British had been a source of some cultural shame for me [and continues to be] but, amidst the treasure hunters who hauled their finds back to England, there had also been people focused on the pursuit of knowledge,\" Chris Pepp\u00e9 writes.",
      "He noted his research revealed a lot about his ancestors who he had dismissed as \"prejudiced Victorians from a bygone era\".",
      "\"I learned that Willie Pepp\u00e9's first wife chose to travel around India for her honeymoon and loved the country and its culture. Sadly, she died from an unspecified illness. I learned that my grandmother was outraged at the land laws that applied to Indian women.",
      "\"And I learned that the excavation of the stupa was an attempt by Willie Pepp\u00e9 to provide work for his tenant farmers who had fallen victim to the famine of 1897.\"",
      "He writes his great-grandfather's \"technical diagrams of ramps and pulleys suggest that he was also a trained engineer who couldn't resist a project\".",
      "William Pepp\u00e9 handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government: the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.",
      "Only a small \"portion of duplicates\", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the Pepp\u00e9 family, he notes. (Sotheby's notes say Pepp\u00e9 was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)",
      "Sources told the BBC the auction house considers the \"duplicates\" to be original items considered surplus to those donated, which the \"Indian government permitted Pepp\u00e9 to retain\".",
      "Over the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The Pepp\u00e9 family has also launched a website to \"share our research\".",
      "Some scholars argue Buddha relics should never be treated as market commodities.",
      "\"The Sotheby's auction transforms these highly sacred materials into saleable objects, in continuation of acts of colonial violence which extracted them from a stupa and called them 'gems' and 'objects of interest to Europeans', creating a false division with the ash and bone fragments they were consecrated with,\" say Thompson and Cheong.",
      "Chris Pepp\u00e9 told the BBC that in all the monasteries he had visited \"no Buddhists regard these as corporeal relics\".",
      "\"A few Buddhist academics\u00a0at western universities have recently offered a convoluted, fact-defying logic whereby they may be regarded as such.\u00a0It's an academic construct that is not shared by Buddhists in general who are familiar with the details of the find,\" he said.",
      "Pepp\u00e9 said the family \"looked into donation [of the relics] to temples and museums and they all presented different problems on closer scrutiny\".",
      "\"An auction seems the fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists and we are confident that Sotheby's will achieve that.\"",
      "Some also point to The Koh-i-Noor, seized by the British East India Company and now part of the Crown Jewels, with many Indians viewing it as stolen. Should the Buddha's jewels be next?",
      "\"Repatriation, I believe, is seldom necessary,\" says Ahuja. \"Such rare and sacred relics that are unique and which define a land's cultural history, however, deserve the government's exceptional attention.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d0l7el36o",
    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 06:29:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists hope to make a universal antivenom from the extraordinary blood of a man exposed to snake venom for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an \"unparalleled\" antivenom, say scientists.",
      "Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests.",
      "Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.",
      "But Mr Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites - which kill up to 140,000 people a year and leave three times as many needing amputations or facing permanent disability.",
      "In total, Mr Friede has endured more than 200 bites and more than 700 injections of venom he prepared from some of the world's deadliest snakes, including multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "He initially wanted to build up his immunity to protect himself when handling snakes, documenting his exploits on YouTube.",
      "But the former truck mechanic said that he had \"completely screwed up\" early on when two cobra bites in quick succession left him in a coma.",
      "\"I didn't want to die. I didn't want to lose a finger. I didn't want to miss work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: \"It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite\".",
      "'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'",
      "Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.",
      "But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another.",
      "There is even wide variety within the same species \u2013 antivenom made from snakes in India is less effective against the same species in Sri Lanka.",
      "A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.",
      "That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.",
      "\"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out,\" he said.",
      "\"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'.\"",
      "Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.",
      "The research focused on elapids \u2013 one of the two families of venomous snakes \u2013 such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.",
      "Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.",
      "Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.",
      "Their work, detailed in the journal Cell, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.",
      "In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.",
      "This is \"unparalleled\" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it \"likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom\".",
      "The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.",
      "The other class of snake \u2013 the vipers \u2013 rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.",
      "\"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes,\" said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.",
      "And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.",
      "\"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition,\" said Prof Kwong.",
      "The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.",
      "Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was \"certainly novel\" and provided \"a strong piece of evidence\" that this was a feasible approach.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction.\"",
      "But he cautioned there was \"much work to do\" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.",
      "But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage \"makes me feel good\".",
      "\"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me. I'm proud of it. It's pretty cool.\""

    "story": [
      "At a military training ground near the city of Wroclaw, ordinary Poles are lining up, waiting to be handed guns and taught how to shoot. \"Once the round is loaded, the weapon is ready to fire,\" barks the instructor, a Polish soldier, his face smeared with camouflage paint.",
      "Young and old, men and women, parents and children, they've all come here for one reason: to learn how to survive an armed attack.",
      "As well as a turn on the shooting range, this Saturday morning programme, called \"Train with the Army\", also teaches civilians hand-to-hand combat, first aid and how to put on a gas mask.",
      "\"The times are dangerous now, we need to be ready,\" says the co-ordinator of the project, Captain Adam Sielicki. \"We have a military threat from Russia, and we are preparing for this.\"",
      "Capt Sielicki says the programme is oversubscribed, and the Polish government now has plans to expand it so that every adult male in the country receives training. Poland, which shares borders with both Russia and Ukraine, says it will spend almost 5% of GDP on defence this year, the highest in Nato.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland aims to build \"the strongest army in the region\". Warsaw has been on a spending spree, buying planes, ships, artillery systems and missiles from the US, Sweden and South Korea, among others.",
      "Dariusz is one of those attending the Saturday course in Wroclaw, and says he would be the \"very first\" to volunteer if Poland were attacked. \"History has taught us that we must be prepared to defend ourselves on our own. We cannot rely on anyone else. Today alliances exist, and tomorrow they are broken.\"",
      "As he removes his gas mask, Bartek says he thinks most Poles \"will take up arms\" if attacked, \"and be ready to defend the country.\"",
      "Agata is attending with a friend. She says the election of Donald Trump has made people more worried. \"He wants to pull out [of Europe]. That's why we feel even less safe. If we're not prepared and Russia attacks us, we'll simply become their prisoners.\"",
      "Statements by Donald Trump and members of his administration have caused deep concern among officials in Warsaw. During a visit to the Polish capital in February, the US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said Europe mustn't assume that the US troop presence on the continent \"will last forever\".",
      "The US currently has 10,000 troops stationed in Poland, but Washington announced last month it was pulling out of a key military base in the city of Rzeszow in the east of Poland. Officials say the troops will be redeployed within Poland, but the move has caused yet more unease in the country.",
      "Donald Trump's apparent hostility towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and warm words for Russia's Vladimir Putin, have only added to the worry.",
      "Poland is due to sign a defence agreement with France in the coming days, and another pact with the UK is in the pipeline \u2013 further moves by Warsaw to pivot away from its historically strong military ties with Washington. There is also talk of Poland being brought under the French military's \"nuclear umbrella\".",
      "\"I think [Trump] has certainly pressed us to think more creatively about our security,\" says Tomasz Szatkowski, the permanent representative of Poland to Nato and presidential advisor on defence. \"I think the US can't afford to lose Poland, because that would be a sign\u2026 that you can't rely on the US. However, we do have to think of other options and develop our own capabilities.\"",
      "\"If the Russians continue their aggressive intentions towards Europe, we're going to be the first one \u2013 the gatekeeper,\" Mr Szatkowski says. He ascribes Poland's rapid military build-up to \"first of all, the geopolitical situation, but also, the experience of history.\"",
      "The painful legacy of Russian occupation can be felt everywhere here.",
      "At a state-run care home in Warsaw, 98-year-old Wanda Traczyk-Stawska recalls the last time Russian forces invaded \u2013 in 1939, when a pact between Stalin and Hitler resulted in Poland being carved up between the USSR and Nazi Germany.",
      "\"In 1939 I was twelve years old. I remember my father was very concerned about [the Russians],\" Wanda recalls, \"We knew that Russia had attacked us, they took advantage of the fact that the Germans had exposed us.\"",
      "On a shelf is a photograph of Wanda as a fighter, brandishing a machine gun during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, when the Polish underground fought the German Army amidst the ruins of the city. After pushing back the Germans in the dying days of World War Two, the Soviet Union installed a pro-Moscow regime in Poland, which ruled the country until 1989.",
      "Currently, around 216,000 servicemen and women make up the Polish armed forces. The government says they intend to increase that to half a million, including reservists \u2013 which would give it the second-largest military in Nato after the United States.",
      "I ask Wanda whether she thinks it's a good thing that Poland is building up its military. \"Of course, yes. Russia has this aggression written into its history. I'm not talking about people, but the authorities are always like that,\" she sighs. \"It is better to be a well-armed country than to wait for something to happen. Because I am a soldier who remembers that weapons are the most important thing.\"",
      "Eighty years since the end of World War Two, Poles are once again eyeing their neighbours nervously. In a warehouse in southern Poland, by popular demand, one company has constructed a mock-up of a bomb shelter.",
      "\"These shelters are designed primarily to protect against a nuclear bomb, but also against armed attacks,\" says Janusz Janczy, the boss of ShelterPro, who shows me around the steel bunker, complete with bunk beds and a ventilation system. \"People are building these shelters simply because they don't know what to expect tomorrow.\"",
      "Janusz says demand for his shelters has soared since Donald Trump took office. \"It used to be just a few phone calls a month. Now there are dozens a week,\" he says, \"My clients are most afraid of Russia. And they're concerned that Nato wouldn't come to defend Poland.\"",
      "But are Poles ready to defend the country if those fears become a reality? A recent poll found that only 10.7% of adults said they would join the army as volunteers in the event of war, and a third said they would flee.",
      "On a sunny afternoon in Wroclaw, I ask Polish students whether they'd be ready to defend their country if attacked. Most say they wouldn't. \"The war is very close but feels quite far,\" says medical student Marcel, \"but if Russia attacked, I think I'd run.\"",
      "\"I would probably be the first one trying to escape the country,\" says another student, Szymon. \"I just don't really see anything worth dying for here.\"",

      "\"My family all left but I told them I had to stay, if Israeli forces come to raid our house I want to be there to stop it being damaged.\"",
      "What followed was three days of fear, with the constant sound of gunfire, explosions and drones flying through the neighbourhood, and issuing of orders that Jumaa couldn't make out amid the noise. Then water and electricity was cut off, his phone ran out of battery and Jumaa felt he could no longer stay.",
      "Now, three months later, Jumaa is standing on a hill in Jenin city, looking out over the ghost town of the refugee camp to which he and the other residents are still prevented from returning by the Israeli military.",
      "He's trying to see if his home is one of the many destroyed by the Israeli forces during their operations against Palestinian armed groups that were present in the camp. The sound of ongoing explosions can be heard below.",
      "\"Some people have told me they think our building was demolished, but we don't know for certain,\" says Jumaa, struggling to express himself through his emotion.",
      "The father of nine, who used to work in construction, stayed for three months in a school-turned-shelter for the camp's displaced residents. He has now moved into accommodation for university students that he shares with his brother.",
      "Before the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Israel was already engaged in a military campaign against armed groups in the West Bank.",
      "A number of groups emerged in the densely-populated urban refugee camps created for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the war that followed the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.",
      "The main groups in Jenin camp are affiliated to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Their fighters have mostly attacked Israeli military forces, alongside sporadic attacks on Israeli settlers in the West Bank.",
      "The number of fighters is unknown but local journalists estimate that there were around 150 fighters in Jenin camp prior to the recent operations by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, launched its own crackdown in Jenin camp in December 2024 and its forces only withdrew when the Israeli military began its major operation there in January.",
      "Israel's defence minister has called the camps \"nests of terror\" and in January stepped up its campaign against the armed groups operating inside them \u2013 entering and blockading a number of refugee camps in the northern West Bank that are home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "It ordered residents to leave and began a wave of building demolitions, while giving some residents brief opportunities to gather belongings.",
      "But with Israel almost entirely blocking access to the camps and not publicly announcing which buildings they've destroyed, many Palestinians are distraught about whether they have a home to return to.",
      "The UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa says its best estimate is that Israel has razed at least 260 buildings containing around 800 apartments during \"Operation Iron Wall\", focusing on three refugee camps in the north of the West Bank: Jenin, Tulkarem and Nur Shams. Unrwa estimates that 42,000 Palestinians have been displaced from the camps since January.",
      "In February, the Israeli military announced it had killed 60 fighters in its operations and arrested 280 others. Meanwhile Palestinian health officials say 100 people have been killed in the West Bank since the start of Israel's January operation until today.",
      "Defence Minister Israel Katz said the army was destroying weapons and infrastructure \"on an extensive scale\" and said he had instructed the military to remain in the refugee camps for a year and prevent residents returning there.",
      "The Israeli military told the BBC that the militias \"exploit the civilian population as human shields and endanger them by planting explosive devices and hiding weapons\".",
      "On 1 May, Israel gave Palestinian officials in the West Bank a new map of 106 buildings it said it would demolish in Tulkarem and Nur Shams refugee camps in the next 24 hours for \"military purposes\". It said residents could apply for a brief window to return home to retrieve essential belongings.",
      "Aid agencies say that Israel's campaign has caused the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in decades.",

      "\"In terms of the number of displaced people and the level of destruction, we've never seen anything like it since 1967,\" he added, referring to the year Israel began its military occupation of the West Bank.",
      "While filming an interview with the mayor of Jenin, the BBC witnessed Israeli forces detain several Palestinians, including municipality workers who were attempting to enter the camp in order to clear a route to a nearby hospital. They were kept for three hours before being released.",
      "\"There are big challenges, in terms of providing services to citizens. As everyone knows, the infrastructure in Jenin camp has been totally demolished,\" says Mayor Mohammad Jarrar.",
      "\"Israel's goal is to try to make Jenin camp totally unfit to live in, and I'm telling you it has now become completely unliveable.\"",
      "Israel's blockade of West Bank refugee camps has made establishing information about what is happening inside nearly impossible, says Unrwa's Roland Friedrich, including the exact extent of demolitions.",
      "Jumaa is among some of the displaced Palestinians who were granted a brief visit home by Israeli forces in order to retrieve belongings. He was able just to grab his UN ID card and the family dog. Then two months later, in March, Israel issued a map of over 90 buildings it identified for demolition in Jenin. Jumaa's residence looked to be among them.",

      "The BBC has compared Israel's March demolition map to satellite imagery of Jenin taken a week later. We have been able to confirm that, by 27 March, at least 33 buildings on the list, including Jumaa's, were destroyed.

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 02:11:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The way events unfolded after the Pulwama bombing and Pahalgam killings is strikingly similar, says a former diplomat.",
    "story": [
      "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.",
      "This is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.",
      "Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.",
      "Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.",
      "Once again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.",
      "\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.",
      "Yet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.",
      "\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.",
      "A week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.",
      "Delhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)",
      "In his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019.",
      "He was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.",
      "Mr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.",
      "They included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.",
      "\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.",
      "\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"",
      "The strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive.",
      "A day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing.",
      "India's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".",
      "While there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution.",
      "At the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".",
      "Much like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.",
      "In a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".",
      "\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes.",
      "On 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.",
      "Six hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.",
      "The crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.",
      "In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",
      "Mr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"",
      "Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.",
      "By 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.",
      "\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"",
      "Mr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".",
      "He views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.",
      "\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"",
      "\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

    "summary": "Leader Pierre Poilievre faces divisions within the Conservative movement as he fights to stay on as leader.",
    "story": [
      "Conservatives in Canada are trading blame for Monday night's election loss, showing that Pierre Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement as he fights to stay on as leader.",
      "As a clear Liberal win was emerging on election night, Conservative candidates and their supporters had one question: What the heck just happened?",
      "The party had lost a remarkable 27-point lead in opinion polls and failed to win an election for the fourth time in a row.",
      "And while it gained seats and earned almost 42% of the popular vote - its highest share since the party was founded in 2003 - its leader Poilievre was voted out of the seat he had held for the past 20 years.",
      "\"Nobody's happy about that,\" Shakir Chambers, a Conservative strategist and vice-president of Ontario-based consultancy firm the Oyster Group, told the BBC.",
      "The party is now trying to work out how it will move forward.",
      "At the top of the agenda will be finding a way for the Conservatives to perform their duties as the Official Opposition - the second-place party in Canada's parliament whose job is to hold the sitting government to account - without their leader in the House.",
      "Ahead of a caucus meeting next Tuesday to discuss this, Poilievre announced on Friday his plan to run in an Alberta constituency special election to win back a seat.",
      "That special election will be triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP-elect Damien Kurek, who said he will voluntarily step down to let Poilievre back in after what he called \"a remarkable national campaign\".",
      "\"An unstoppable movement has grown under his leadership, and I know we need Pierre fighting in the House of Commons,\" Kurek said in a statement.",
      "Unlike the US, federal politicians in Canada do not have to live in the city or province they run in. Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.",
      "A big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.",
      "\"Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,\" he said. \"I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.\"",
      "A number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to \"ensure we finish the job next time\".",
      "Others are casting blame on where they went wrong.",
      "Jamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.",
      "The federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.",
      "He frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war.",
      "\"He couldn't stay out of our business,\" Jivani told a CBC reporter.",
      "Jivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of \"positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from\".",
      "But Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.",
      "Poilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable among the general Canadian public.",
      "He has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.",
      "\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".",
      "\"Isn't that ironic?\"",
      "Another Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.",
      "\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.",
      "Not every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.",
      "Kory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.",
      "He told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.",
      "\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.",
      "\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said.",
      "\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"",
      "He added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".",

      "In January a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast after 14 harrowing days lost at sea. Some 50 people died on the voyage, many of whom were lied to by people smugglers promising safe and legal routes to Europe. BBC Verify has tracked one of the traffickers responsible - documenting his activities across three continents.",
      "Punjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together.",
      "The three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.",
      "But it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.",
      "The video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.",
      "Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.",
      "Meanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.",
      "When BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.",
      "Fadi, the nomad smuggler",
      "Fadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.",
      "Pakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.",
      "But Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.",
      "His current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.",
      "One other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.",
      "Since 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.",
      "The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.",
      "Many Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.",
      "These migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).",
      "There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.",
      "Gujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.",
      "Multiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.",
      "Further clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.",
      "Videos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.",
      "Backtracking on promises",
      "One survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.",
      "But when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.",
      "\"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\"",

      "Listen: From a smuggler's TikTok to tragedy",
      "As well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar.",
      "Once they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in \"safe houses\" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers.",
      "One person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.",
      "BBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited.",

      "Survivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.",
      "But the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea.",
      "Uzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\".",
      "According to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.",
      "\"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\"",
      "Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.",
      "Others died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.",
      "Those still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.",

They allege Gujjar collected $75,000 (\u00a356,000) for his role in the January disaster. Three people paid in full, while the remaining three had only paid deposits, the police reports said.",

      "The Spring 2025 exhibition, titled \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" will invoke Black creativity, innovation and expression in fashion, culture and style. The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met. The exhibit nods to the stories of Black style told through clothing by the African diaspora beginning in the 18th century.",
      "The exhibit is funded largely by contributions from the Met Gala, where every year the biggest and wealthiest names gather to show off the best in fashion.",

      "2024 Met Gala theme: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\"",
      "In 2024, the Met Gala explored the themes of rebirth and renewal through nature and the passage of time. Referencing the 1962 J.G. Ballard short story \"The Garden of Time\" celebrities, entrepreneurs, athletes and designers wore floral gowns and referenced nature's everlasting forms.",
      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture. Instagram sponsored the event and brought to the carpet executives turned celebrities, including author, viral influencer and director of fashion partnerships at Instagram Evan Chen, and the social app's chief Adam Mosseri.",
      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",

      "Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors' Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse's College of Theatre Arts.",

      "She got her national television break on \"The Garry Moore Show\" in 1964, just after Carol Burnett was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. She played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician's assistant to Dom DeLuise's character Dominic the Great.",

      "Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams.",
      "She appeared in Ball's last comedy series, \"Life With Lucy.\"",
      "Buzzi guested in music videos with \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, the B-52's and the Presidents of the United States of America.",
      "She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including \"Pound Puppies,\" \"Berenstain Bears,\" \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Angry Beavers.\"",

      "Her movie credits included \"Freaky Friday,\" \"Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,\" \"The North Avenue Irregulars,\" and \"The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.\"",
      "Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as \"I have never faked a sarcasm\" and \"Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.\"",
      "She married Perkins, an actor, in 1978.",
      "The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville.",

      "The expedition, which followed Burleson's previous fear-conquering skydive with the U.S. Army, brought him face-to-face with nine Galapagos sharks \u2014 creatures that can grow to more than 10 feet long with 14 rows of serrated teeth.",
      "Dr. Andrew Rossiter, director of the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu, said that while sharks are indeed predators, humans are not their natural prey.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 12:27:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Laid-off employees ranged from those working in firefighter health programs, to those approving new respirators.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly all of the remaining staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health.",
      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",
      "NIOSH was started in 1970 as part of the same law that created another federal agency called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. In addition to its own voluntary recommendations for employers, NIOSH produces research to inform OSHA's regulations and enforcement.",
      "NIOSH employees receiving layoff notices late Friday included some workers for the World Trade Center Health Program, miner safety, and firefighter health programs. Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",
      "Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut.",
      "Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",
      "Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers.",
      "Efforts to spot and warn of counterfeit personal protective equipment was also halted due to the layoffs, officials said.",
      "\"Millions of workers across various sectors - including healthcare, construction, and emergency services - depend on NIOSH-approved respirators. Without these approvals, their safety is compromised, leading to potential illness, injury, or even death,\" laid-off employees wrote in a letter shared with CBS News.",
      "HHS responds to NIOSH layoffs",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, asking what would happen to the agency's work now that most of its teams had been eliminated. The department had previously said that NIOSH would be absorbed into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "In\u00a0a post Saturday on X, the department said that firefighter programs were still a top priority and that as \"the agency continues to streamline operations, the essential services provided by NIOSH will remain fully intact and uninterrupted.\"",
      "The department also claimed no CDC employees had been terminated on Friday and only a \"required notice was sent to NIOSH employees, following the agreed-upon standard process with the union.\"",
      "Laid-off NIOSH workers told CBS News that the department's post was misleading, since workers represented by unions were still on the job until Friday, when they received letters from HHS informing them of the layoffs and that they would be locked out of the agency's buildings.",
      "That capped a process which started\u00a0in late March, after unions received a notice saying that most NIOSH employees could be cut by the end of June. In the past, unions could use that time to negotiate with the department, allowing employees to continue to work during talks that might mitigate or avoid a \"reduction in force\" of their members.",
      "However, unions were unable to initiate negotiations with Kennedy's department to head off the layoff notices Friday.\u00a0 An executive order issued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challenged in court.",

    "story": [
      "Weekly measles cases have set a new record, according to figures published Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, topping the peak of an outbreak in 2019 that ranked as the worst since the 1990s.",
      "The number of cases that had their symptoms start during the week of March 30 has grown to 111, according to the agency's latest update. Authorities backdate newly reported measles cases based on when their rash began, to account for delays in reporting and diagnosis.",
      "That tops the 102 cases reported for the week of March 23, 2019, at the height of that year's wave. By the end of 2019, measles cases that year added up to the largest annual tally since endemic spread of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.",
      "This year, the majority of cases are from an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now larger than any other single outbreak since the virus was eliminated. Between\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0New Mexico, at least 750 of the measles cases reported this year have been linked to that outbreak. Cases in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0and other states have also been linked to the outbreak.",
      "There have been 11 other local outbreaks of measles within the U.S. this year, up from 10 last week.",
      "While the pace of new cases looks to have declined in Texas, officials caution it is too soon to say whether the outbreak is truly ending.",
      "\"We look at the trends over time and we'd want to see several weeks of decline. New cases sometimes get reported to public health up to a week after someone was tested, especially if the test was done at a commercial lab,\" Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Anton said authorities are also watching to see if travel from the Easter holiday weekend last month will result in an increase.",
      "\"Cases from travel that weekend would likely start to be reported in the next week or two,\" Anton said.",
      "This year's tally of cases is likely an undercount, officials and experts have said, citing anecdotes of unreported infections. The unusually high severity of this year's wave also suggests many mild cases of spread are going undiagnosed.",
      "For example, authorities in Canada have confirmed more than 1,000 measles cases so far this year, after record outbreaks there. The U.S. has tallied at least 935 this year, according to the CDC.",
      "In Canada, 7% of cases have resulted in hospitalizations, less than the 13% of cases that have resulted in hospitalizations in the U.S. Three Americans have also died from measles so far this year, compared to none in Canada.",

      "About 50 of the reports cited second- or third-degree burns to consumers' faces or bodies, the statement said.

    "story": [
      "Diabetes deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate data for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC figures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase.",
      "\"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.",
      "\"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said.",
      "There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional data reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.",
      "Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen high demand.",
      "Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes in 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.",
      "Experts caution that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.",
      "Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately.",
      "\"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\" Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",

      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",

      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",

      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",

    "story": [
      "Investor Warren Buffett told thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday he plans to step down as CEO.",
      "Buffett, who has been leading Berkshire Hathaway for 60 years, said he will step down at the end of the year. He had previously said he didn't want to retire because he enjoys figuring out where to invest Berkshire's money too much, and that he planned to continue working until he dies or becomes incapacitated.",
      "Buffett said he will recommend to Berkshire Hathaway's board that Greg Abel should become CEO at the end of the year.",
      "\"I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,\" Buffett said. \"I want to spring that on the directors effectively, and then get that as my recommendation ... I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it.\"",
      "The 94-year-old remains in good health, though he does use a cane. Buffett announced the news at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer period and didn't take any questions about it.",
      "He said the only board members who knew this was coming were his two children, Howard and Susie Buffett. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, had no warning.",
      "About an hour later, Abel came out to oversee the formal Berkshire business meeting without Buffett, and he addressed the announcement.",
      "\"I just want to say I couldn't be more humbled and honored to be part of Berkshire as we go forward,\" Abel said.",
      "Abel has been Buffett's designated successor for years, and he already manages all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses. But it was always assumed he wouldn't take over until after Buffett's death.",
      "Buffett also said he will not be selling any shares of Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "\"I will not, I have no intention, zero of selling one share, of Berkshire Hathaway, it will get given away, gradually,\" he said. \"The decision to keep every share is an economic decision, because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under management than mine.\"",
      "Buffett gave warning on Trump's tariffs",
      "The announcement came as he warned that the United States shouldn't use \"trade as a weapon\" and anger the rest of the world like President Trump has done with his\u00a0tariffs that roiled global markets.",
      "\"It's a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don't like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,\" Buffett, 94, said as he addressed the topic on everyone's mind at the start of the shareholders meeting.",
      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Mr. Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "\"We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,\" he said.",
      "America has been going through revolutionary changes ever since its birth and the promise of equality for all, which wasn't fulfilled until years later, Buffett said. But nothing that is going on today has changed his long-term optimism about the country.",
      "\"If I were being born today, I would just keep negotiating in the womb until they said, 'You could be in the United States,'\" Buffett said.",
      "Tariffs were the top subject that shareholders asked about in the questions they sent ahead of time to the CNBC reporter who will grill Buffett and his top two managers throughout the day. But investors will also be looking for him to explain why he is sitting on $347.7 billion in cash at Berkshire.",
      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \"bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\"",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people, including celebrities and well-known investors. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance this year. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly, before backing away from politics and other controversial topics for fear of hurting Berkshire's businesses.",
      "Attendee Haibo Liu traveled from China and camped out overnight outside the arena to be first in line Saturday morning.",
      "\"He has helped me a lot,\" said Liu. \"I really want to express my thanks to him.\"",

      "Warren Buffett said in 2021 that Greg Abel, his top lieutenant for many years and an energy executive, would become CEO when he retired. Buffett also often famously said he has no plans to retire.",
      "Abel, who currently oversees all of Berkshire's non-insurance companies, was born in Alberta, Canada, according to a 2016\u00a0Fortune\u00a0profile of the executive. The former amateur hockey player and avid golfer joined Berkshire in 2000 when the insurance company acquired MidAmerican. Abel was CEO of the Iowa utility, a regional energy provider with just $122 million in sales.",
      "Once at Berkshire, Abel rebuilt MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country. Berkshire's utility operations now generate billions in annual revenue.",
      "Abel was named vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 2018. Although he has been at the company for more than two decades, he is considered to be much more guarded and hands-on than Buffett.",
      "\"I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be a good thing,\" Steven Check, who runs Check Capital Management, said beforehand, the Associated Press reported. But he said Abel also knows that those managers enjoy the freedom to run their businesses and Abel isn't going to do anything to turn them off.",
      "Abel is well regarded by Berkshire's managers and Buffett has praised his business acumen for years, the AP said. But he will have a hard time matching Buffett's legendary performance, and since he doesn't control 30% of Berkshire's stock like Buffett does, he won't have as much leeway.",
      "Abel lived in Omaha for six years\u00a0in the 1990s, just a few blocks from Buffett. During that time, the two had never met, according to Buffett.",

      "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the architect of ChatGPT, is behind a venture that wants to solve a modern-day problem: proving you're human amidst a proliferation of bots and artificial intelligence.",
      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",

      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, new federal data shows, a sign the labor market is still humming despite ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger than expected in April, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly employment report. Payroll gains exceeded economist forecasts of 135,000 last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, matching forecasts from analysts polled by FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The data suggests the labor market remains healthy despite rising concerns about how the Trump administration's tariff policies will impact economic activity.",
      "Carl Weinberg, chief economist with High Frequency Economics, said in a research note that the stronger-than-expected pace of job-creation last month shows the risks of a recession are low, at least for now.",
      "\"There is nothing to complain about here. You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures,\" he said, while noting that tariffs are likely to take a toll on hiring in the months to come.\"We are waiting for layoffs to begin and for claims and unemployment to rise,\" he added. \"This month's payrolls figure was a lot better than expected, but the strong trend in employment does not last in our forecast.\"",
      "Health care companies, along with the transportation and warehousing sector, saw the largest gains in employment last month, adding 51,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively.",
      "The jump in transportation and warehousing jobs \u2014 more than double its 12-month average of 12,000 \u2014 was notable. Cory Stahle, an economist from Indeed Hiring Lab economist, thinks that could indicate companies are adding to their inventories ahead of tariffs taking effect and boosting their costs.",
      "Federal employment declined by 9,000, up from 4,000 in March. Government layoffs have risen in recent months because of cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which the Trump administration touts as a cost-saving effort.",
      "\"April may have been the last month when we didn't see the aggregate impact of trade war 2.0, DOGE job cuts and tight immigration policy. But look closely enough and there are hints, like the slight decline in manufacturing payrolls and another drop in federal government jobs,\" Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Although the latest employment numbers suggest a steady job market, government data this week showed that more Americans are filing for unemployment benefits as layoffs mount. Jobless claims increased 18,000 to 241,000 for the week ending April 26, the highest level since mid-February, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "\"Continued claims are more volatile week to week, but remain elevated, signaling that workers who lose their job are facing challenges in finding new employment,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "In another important snapshot of the economy this week, the nation's gross domestic product shrank 0.3% in the first three months of the year, down from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. The main reason for the sharp decline was the rush by consumers and businesses to order imported goods ahead of tariffs taking effect (Imports reduce GDP, while exports increase it.)",
      "What experts are saying",
      "Experts say the economy has proved resilient, with steady hiring despite concern over the Trump administration's trade policies. A recession appears unlikely for now, although economists note it could take several months for tariff-induced instability to appear in the government's monthly job numbers.",
      "\"Some of the increase in employment in April... reflects a burst of pre-tariff activity, which will unravel over the next couple months,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Soft data like consumer confidence survey,\u00a0polling\u00a0and jobless claims show signs of economic weakness.",
      "The solid job gains in April also increase the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate steady when policy makers meet next week on May 6-7, experts say.",
      "\"The healthy 177,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in April and unchanged unemployment rate will reassure the Fed that there is no need to be hasty in lowering interest rates when it meets next week,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report.",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 13:02:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Cheaper goods from China are no longer exempt from import duties, which could sharply raise prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Cheaper goods from China are set to become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers with the May 2 expiration of a loophole that formerly allowed lower cost packages to enter the country duty-free.",
      "Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu are among the major players that until Friday relied on the loophole that allowed them to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, allowing them to undercut U.S.-based sellers. American shoppers relied on the de minimis loophole, too, for bargain-basement prices that couldn't be matched for goods made in the U.S.",
      "With the end of the loophole, which exempted packages worth $800 from import levies, many goods from China and other countries will no longer\u00a0be as low-priced as they once were. Trade experts also note that to comply with the law, importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. That could mean substantial delays in shipments, experts note.",
      "What is the de minimis loophole?",
      "The provision was introduced in 1938 as Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930. It was designed to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting negligible duties on low-value goods at a high cost to the government.",
      "From 2018 to 2023, the value of low-value e-commerce exports from China ballooned from $5.3 billion to $66 billion, according to a February report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The 1938 provision has been the \"primary path\" for Chinese exports to enter the U.S. market, the report notes.",
      "Why did Trump eliminate the de minimis exemption?",
      "President Trump in February said he would eliminate the loophole because he didn't believe China was taking sufficient action to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order eliminating the duty-free treatment for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2. As of Friday, packages that would have qualified for exemption under the de minimis provision will \"be subject to all applicable duties,\" the executive order states.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the de minimis exemption \"a big scam going on against our country, against really small businesses.\"",
      "\"We put an end to it,\" he said.",
      "Goods from China are subject to new tariffs of up to 145%, while Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on goods from the U.S.",
      "What does the end of the exemption mean for consumers?",
      "Retailers are already tacking on hefty tariff surcharges to customers' orders, leading to sticker shock for some U.S. shoppers who had long relied on China for cheap imported goods.",
      "\"The way we shop online will never be the same,\" Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of Publican, a company that authenticates shipment documentation, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Specifically, \"everything will take more time, cost more money, and everything that's price-sensitive won't be available,\" he said.",
      "The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets. But the end of the loophole will lead to a \"much diminished market,\" said Mary Lovely, an international trade expert and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "If prices of Chinese goods rise, there will be less demand, and sellers could decide to import fewer goods.",
      "\"You'll see much diminished market and at some point it won't be worth it to import to a small market,\" so you'll see products disappearing, Lovely said.",
      "Could the new rule cause delays?",
      "Requiring millions more packages to be inspected daily will create a challenge for CBP, experts noted.",
      "\"It will be an administrative nightmare, so you will see a lot of delays,\" Ryan Young, a trade policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "It's unclear if the government has enough CBP agents to efficiently inspect packages and enforce policies, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"As these adjustments are made, a key question remains, which is the ability of CBP to effectively regulate and enforce these measures,\" Ben Tzion said. \"As of today. CBP does not have that ability.\"",
      "\"Without personnel, you'll have backlogs and pile ups and U.S. customs might have to get more warehousing space,\" Young added.",
      "Who might benefit?",
      "Companies that sell goods made in the U.S. could face less competition as previously cheap China-made goods rise to new price highs.",
      "\"Consumers could become more wary of foreign brands to avoid paying hefty prices,\" Ines Durand, a retail strategist at Similarwab, a web analytics company.",
      "Larger corporations with bigger profit margins, or more diversified businesses, will likely fare better than smaller retailers that operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to re-jigger supply chains.",
      "The consumer won't emerge unscathed.",
      "\"The rollback of the de minimis exemption for tariffed goods is poised to hit consumers' wallets,\" PwC consumer markets industry leader Ali Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Guangzhou, China\u00a0\u2014 The annual Canton Fair in Guangzhou is China's largest import-export trade show. It covers a space equal to about 200 football fields and has been running since 1957 \u2014 when China's economy was isolated from the rest of the world. The country's leaders decided the expo, since formally named the China Import and Export Fair, was the best way to overcome trade obstacles imposed by the West and to drum up business investment and interest from overseas markets.",
      "In the almost seven decades since, China has transformed into the world's manufacturing powerhouse. But President Xi Jinping's government believes the U.S. is once again working to isolate China, through President Trump's tariff trade war, and that Washington will try to force other countries \u2014 and their consumers \u2014 to pick a side.",
      "Richard Qiu told CBS News it's simply unfair. Wearing a pale blue Ralph Lauren shirt, the businessman invited CBS News to sit down in his display booth at the Canton Fair for a chat. Surrounded by thousands of small fabric gift bags designed for everything from Christmas to Easter to birthdays, the fact that Qiu even quickly agreed to an interview was disarming; Every other Chinese businessperson we approached turned our camera away, wary of speaking with foreign media.",
      "His openness and warmth indicated a sense of ease with Westerners, and more importantly, his desire to tell his story about how external forces, completely out of his control, were affecting him and his livelihood.",
      "Qiu's Liaoning Perfect Import/Export Co. Ltd has been making gift bags for 20 years, and he has fostered strong relationships with his U.S. customers, who, in recent years, have made up 30-40% of his exports. He's traveled to the U.S. at least six times and says he loves the country: \"It's about freedom, democracy, it's open and fair.\"",
      "\"But this isn't fair,\" he said of the trade war sparked by President Trump's steep tariffs. \"It makes me feel sick about the U.S. now.\"",
      "Mr. Trump insists his tariffs will, despite current economic pain in the U.S., bring manufacturing back to America and buoy the economy, reshaping the global trade system. But Qiu said it's about something else. He believes President Trump is punishing China for being the best at producing everyday products at affordable prices, and using that prowess to dominate the global market.",
      "\"Our people are industrious, diligent, working hard to make the products good price, good quality, to sell all over the world. It's not our problem,\" he said. \"I think it's your problem.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump imposed 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports \u2014 though the White House later exempted smartphones and some other electronics from the levies \u2014 Qiu says his U.S. sales have ground to a halt.",
      "\"U.S. buyers said, 'Richard you have to stop production; we have to cancel it.' I think 90% of my U.S. orders will be canceled.\"",
      "For years, the Canton Fair has been packed with American buyers looking to bring their customers back at home the best possible deals on offer. But this year, officials admitted to CBS News that the numbers are way down \u2014 another sign of President Trump's trade war taking hold.",
      "One American we did come across perusing the stalls in Guangzhou wasn't there to buy, but rather to research new products.",
      "\"Tariffs are going to come down at some point and we need to be ready for it,\" Jonathan Scheerz who lives in Michigan, where he runs a homewares business, told CBS News. He said he got a lot of orders in for products from China before Mr. Trump's inauguration, because he was anticipating a trade war \u2014 but not like this.",
      "\"I don't want to bring them in at the current tariff rate,\" he lamented. \"It just doesn't work. It's too high, but I also don't believe it's going to last months and months.\"",
      "The optimism is based on his belief that no one does it better than China when it comes to offering so many different products at such low prices.",
      "\"In my eyes, China produces what you want,\" Scheerz said. \"Simple as that.\"",
      "But if the trade war does drag on, many business owners who spoke with CBS News off camera said they were prepared to take the pain.",
      "Qiu knows tough days are ahead. He's looking to diversify his export portfolio in Europe, but there's only so much the market can absorb, so it's uncertain times.",
      "\"It's like a war, I think. Under a war, the most suffering is the people, no matter if it's the U.S. or China,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Qiu added, however, that over the course of China's history, the country has endured real hardship and pain, and he believes the Chinese people have the strength and fortitude to do it again.",
      "\"If we do something unfair, I will not support the government, but it's your government \u2014 the U.S. government that's put unfair things on us, so we say, 'okay, we fight.'\"",

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 07:02:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The joint economic investment between the U.S. and Ukraine comes after China restricted exports of some rare earth minerals to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The joint economic investment deal announced Wednesday that gives the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals may provide Ukraine with more support for its defense against Russia. But it also comes at a key moment for the American economy amid its growing trade war with China, a major producer of rare earths and other critical minerals.",
      "The new deal was described by Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economic development minister, as an equal partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine that\u00a0includes development of\u00a0mineral, oil and gas projects. The U.S. will provide either direct financial assistance or new military assistance to Ukraine, which will contribute half of any royalties from future oil, gas and mineral licenses.",
      "The pact comes as America's access to rare earth minerals, which are key to manufacturing high-tech products like computer chips and military equipment, has diminished after China last month announced export restrictions on some of these minerals in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Although Mr. Trump has suggested buying Greenland, which has rare earths and critical minerals as well as oil and natural gas, Ukraine may provide a more readily available source for these strategically vital natural resources, experts say.",
      "\"You hear a lot about Greenland, but that is a very, very long term play with a lot of building up of infrastructure and a lot of ice-melting, to be fair,\" Heidi Crebo-Rediker, an expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, told CBS News.",
      "By contrast, Ukraine has the workforce and the metallurgical know-how to extract and develop these rare earth minerals, she added. Here's what to know about the U.S.' deal with Ukraine.",
      "What does the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal cover?",
      "The deal covers minerals, including rare earth elements, but also other valuable resources, including oil and natural gas, according to the text released by Ukraine's government.",
      "It does not include resources that currently generate revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new American investments.",
      "Ukrainian officials have also noted that the deal does not refer to any debt obligations for Kyiv, meaning profits are unlikely to go toward paying the U.S. back for its previous financial support for the country in its war with Russia, according to Svyrydenko.",
      "The text of the deal lists 55 minerals subject to the U.S-Ukraine agreement, but says more can be added to the pact. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in Ukraine's rare earth elements, and some of them are included in the list, as are other critical minerals, including titanium, lithium and uranium.",
      "What are rare earth minerals?",
      "Rare earth minerals are a set of 17 metallic elements, such as scandium and yttrium, according to U.S. Geological Survey. Scandium is used in aluminum alloys for aerospace parts, while yttrium is used in LEDs and solid oxide fuel cells, according to Stanford Advanced Materials, a scandium supplier.",
      "China is the the world's largest producer of rare earths, data from the Geological Survey shows.",
      "Aside from rare earth minerals, China also dominates production of critical minerals such as lithium and graphite, which are both essential for producing batteries used in electric vehicles and other devices.",
      "How large are Ukraine's mineral reserves?",
      "Ukraine holds about 5% of total global mineral reserves, which include both critical minerals and rare earth elements, according to Capital Economics, which cited the Ukrainian Geological Survey.",
      "\"Monetary estimates of Ukraine's reserves vary wildly. However, there is a lot of skepticism over the accuracy of Ukraine's national estimates given they reportedly rely on outdated Soviet-era assessments,\" Capital Economics said in a May 1 research note.",
      "Currently, Ukraine's critical minerals generate less than $200 million in annual export revenues, analysts with the investment advisory firm said. \"[T]he reality is that most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are unlikely to be economically viable, especially in the near term,\" they added.",
      "Ukraine has large deposits of cobalt and nickel, which are important for high-performance batteries, Crebo-Rediker said.",
      "What's happening with China's minerals?",
      "China placed new restrictions on seven heavy rare earth minerals on April 4, including scandium and yttrium, in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.",
      "\"Beijing has a history of responding to measures such as tariffs and tech controls from Washington by imposing curbs on exports of raw materials to the U.S.,\" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a May 1 report.",
      "They added, \"Under President Trump, it seems that developing alternative sources of supply will remain a key priority, which could limit any disruption to supply chains from geopolitics in the medium term and reduce Western reliance on China and its allies.\"",
      "China has a \"a near complete chokehold on another important critical material \u2014 graphite,\" Crebo-Rediker added. \"Ukraine is the fifth-largest producer of graphite and also gallium, which is restricted by China right now.\"",
      "What is the state of Ukraine's minerals industry?",
      "Ukraine's rare earth elements are largely untapped because of state policies regulating the industry, a lack of good information about deposits and the war with Russia. The industry's potential is also unclear given that mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate, according to analysts.",
      "In general, however, Ukraine's natural resources are considered to have signifiant commercial potential. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe's largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe's largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian minerals industry accounted for 6.1% of the country's gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Mr. Trump's interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",

    "story": [
      "As Small Business Month kicks off, the Chamber of Commerce is speaking out against the Trump administration's trade policy, saying recently imposed tariffs could do serious damage to America's Main Street.",
      "In a letter\u00a0sent to the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday, Suzanne Clark, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, asks for an \"automatic exclusion\" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. Small businesses do not have the margin or capital reserves to survive an increase in tariffs, Clark wrote in the letter.",
      "\"The Chamber requests the administration take immediate action to save America's small businesses and stave off a recession,\" she wrote.",
      "The Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have\u00a0raised the chances\u00a0of a recession over the next 12 months, according to economists. Still, the International Monetary Fund\u00a0said\u00a0in April it does not expect the U.S. to enter a recession in 2025.",
      "Clark added that tariffs could cause \"irreparable harm\" to the small business community if trade deals are not reached soon. Products from most countries are subject a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.",
      "In an interview with Time\u00a0magazine last week, President Trump said that trade deals would be reached in the \"next three to four weeks.\" In the meantime, small businesses are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to operate amid uncertainty as a result of on-and-off tariffs. One business owner who recently spoke to\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch\u00a0said she fears her company may have to close up shop for good.",
      "Less room to maneuver",
      "If tariffs persist, small business owners could end up passing on the cost to customers in the form of higher prices, as large corporations such as Amazon, Temu and Shein have done in recent weeks.",
      "However, unlike huge corporations, any declines in consumer spending as a result of higher prices could spell financial disaster for many small businesses, which typically operate with tight margins. Roughly 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four months, according to a recent TD Bank survey.",
      "\"The Chamber is hearing from small business owners every day who are seeing their ability to survive endangered by the recent increased in tariff rates,\" Clark said in the letter to the Trump administration.",
      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, sent a letter\u00a0last week to the Small Business Administration (SBA) calling on the Trump administration to grant tariff exemptions to Main Street enterprises.",
      "\"These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, wrote.",

      "The burger chain's same-store sales in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, reflecting economic pressures weighing on low- and middle-income consumers in particular, McDonald's said on its earnings call. That marks the biggest U.S. decline for the company since the COVID-19 pandemic forced stores to close nationwide.",
      "Kempczinski added that traffic to U.S. restaurants fell more sharply than the company had anticipated, and that \"we're not immune to the volatility in the industry or the pressures that our consumers are facing.\"",
      "President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda has stoked widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers alike. Many companies are pulling back on growth and expansion, and delaying placing orders for goods manufactured overseas, as a result of the uncertainty caused by evolving rates, and the on-again, off-again status of U.S. trade policy.",
      "Consumers are also hunkering down and delaying some purchases as their confidence in the health of the economy plunges. Shoppers are concerned that tariffs could re-ignite inflation, and make everyday goods unaffordable, while economists are raising the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession in 2025.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, insists that tariffs don't hurt Americans, and will instead spark investment in U.S. manufacturing, and create more jobs on U.S. soil.",
      "But consumers and businesses say otherwise, with McDonald's being on among numerous corporations saying they're taking a hit. \"We remain cautious about the overall health of the consumer,\" Kempczinski added.",

      "Amid sweeping tariffs newly imposed by President Trump, including 145% levies on\u00a0goods made in China, businesses are raising prices on a wide range of products, rather than absorbing the added costs from the\u00a0steep taxes on imported items.\u00a0Some are opting to tell consumers exactly why prices are rising by adding tariff surcharges to customers' bills. Others are simply raising prices across the board.",
      "Political news site Punchbowl on Tuesday\u00a0reported\u00a0that Amazon planned to list added costs derived from tariffs next to certain products sold on its site. The e-commerce giant pushed back on the report's claim, telling CBS News on Tuesday that its Amazon Haul store only \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\"",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in statement Tuesday.",
      "Other retailers both big and small are taking the opposite tack and showing customers exactly how much\u00a0tariffs are adding to product costs.",
      "\"This is transparency\"",
      "David Warrick, executive vice president of Overhaul, a supply-chain management company, said most businesses can't absorb tariffs of as high as 145% on goods from China and are passing price hikes onto consumers.",
      "\"This is transparency,\" he said of some retailers' decision to display tariff charges on customer receipts.",
      "\"Consumers should understand that this is what you're paying for, and what the cost of trade policy is and how it's uplifting prices,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's useful, and a good demonstration of how tariffs are impacting daily spending.\"",

      "\"No import charges for all local warehouse items and no extra charges upon delivery,\" the Temu website says of the wide range of goods that are already in the U.S.",
      "Still, that isn't stopping some Temu shoppers from griping about the heavy new import costs on goods purchased from China, which can be greater than the value of goods themselves. In one\u00a0Reddit post dedicated to Temu and tariffs, shoppers shared screenshots of the import duties, which were added to their total bills.",
      "According to another shopper, the purchased goods\u00a0totaled $138.97, while the \"import charges\" amounted to $117.64. A third customer posted\u00a0a receipt showing import charges of $60.57 on goods worth $47.52.",
      "Triangl, an online swimwear company, announced that as of April 30, orders from U.S.-based customers will include tariff charges at checkout. On Thursday, a one-piece woman's swimsuit sold on the site with a retail cost of $119 was subject to tax of $12.35, while shipping costs ran $20. Import duties on the item amounted to $211.11, raising the final price to $362.46.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 15:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Starbucks plans to hire more baristas at thousands of stores starting in May as the coffee chain looks to improve customer service.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is rethinking the role of \"innovation\" in running a coffee chain.",
      "After rolling out a new system of technical enhancements to streamline cold food and drink orders, the company made an abrupt U-turn this week and said it would halt use of its automated equipment and restore the human touch by bringing more baristas on board.",
      "The reboot comes at a delicate time for the restaurant giant, which is under pressure to boost sales and revive a brand that has lost its luster with some customers. Although Starbucks remains profitable, its sales slowed last year. In the company's most recent quarter its revenues rose 2% to $8.7 billion, falling just short of Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $8.8 billion.",
      "In a bid to win back customers, starting in May Starbucks will expand its \"Green Apron service model\" which will involve hiring new baristas at thousands of locations and fine-tuning an algorithm to manage orders, CEO Brian Niccol said on a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this week.",
      "\"What we've learned over the last couple of months, specifically behind both the algorithm pilot and the labor pilot, is the combination of staffing, deployment and technology gives us the outcomes of a great customer connection experience as well as the right speed and throughput associated with what we want to achieve, both in-cafe, mobile order and drive-thru,\" Niccol said.",
      "What is the Siren system?",
      "Named after the\u00a0twin-tailed mermaid\u00a0that serves as the face of the company's branding, the Siren system is a series of hot and cold food equipment that Starbucks started rolling out in 2022 to \"make crafting beverages and food more straightforward\" for workers, according to the coffee chain's website. The Siren System is installed in less than 10% of U.S. company operated stores, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.",
      "Building on that platform, Starbucks unveiled the Siren Craft System in July 2024. The technology is aimed at streamlining beverage and food preparation, shortening wait times, and helping baristas deal with the daily flood of orders, including the speciality concoctions the coffee chain has become known for, according to Starbucks.",
      "Less than a year later, however, Niccol said the company will halt its deployment of the Siren tech and instead invest more in labor. Focusing on expanding its workforce, the company said, has proven more effective than implementing new tech when it comes to driving growth.",
      "\"It's not that we're not going to ever use the Siren system,\" Niccol said in the earnings call. \"It's just not something that we need to be rolling out across all 10,000 stores.\"",
      "Starbucks will bring more baristas on board this year at thousands of locations and allow employees to pick up extra shifts, the Starbucks CEO said. The company's hope is that small personal touches \u2014 like handwritten notes from baristas on their cups and ceramic to-stay mugs \u2014 will keep customers coming in the door and entice them to stay longer.",
      "\"What we're discovering is the equipment doesn't solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\" Niccol said.",
      "To be sure, Starbucks isn't turning its back on tech. While Siren is taking a backseat, the CEO also said the company is testing a new sequencing algorithm that has lowered drive-thru and in-store wait times to less than four minutes.",
      "Starbucks\u00a0employs around 361,000 workers worldwide, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. In February, the coffee chain\u00a0announced\u00a0it would lay off 1,100 corporate employees, about 7% of all its white-collar workforce. This did not include baristas who service the stores.",
      "How much do baristas earn?",
      "Starbucks baristas earn an average of $19 an hour, according to a spokesperson. The company also offers health care, retirement and other benefits, distinguishing it from many retailers.",
      "\"When you factor in benefits, our comprehensive compensation package averages $30 per hour,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Starbucks' automation push was part of a larger effort to draw more customers to its stores, known as the \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. After enjoying years of rapid growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "Looking for a refresh, the company in 2024 brought Niccol \u2014 a highly regarded restaurant industry veteran who as CEO of Chipotle had helped the fast-casual chain more than double its business \u2014 in as chief executive.",
      "In coming aboard in September, Niccol promised\u00a0to elevate the in-store experience, reduce wait times and boost sales. \"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" Niccol\u00a0said\u00a0during a call with analysts last year.",

    "summary": "Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said report claiming company's board contacted recruitment firms to begin search for new CEO  is \"absolutely false.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm said the electric vehicle maker's board has not contacted recruitment firms to start a search for a new CEO\u00a0to replace Elon Musk.",
      "Denholm was responding to a report in the Wall Street Journal that said board members had reached out to several hiring firms to work on a formal process for finding a new Tesla CEO. The report also said that Tesla board members told Musk he needed to spend more time at the company.",
      "\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" Denholm wrote in a May 1 post on X, the social media app owned by Musk. \"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\"",
      "The Journal's report comes after Tesla's first-quarter sales and profit\u00a0took a hit amid a backlash from some consumers about Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Led by Musk, the cost-cutting task force has overseen the mass firings of federal workers, including more than 216,000 government employees terminated from their jobs in March.",
      "When Tesla announced its first-quarter results on April 22, Musk said that he would significantly cut back his time on DOGE and spend more time at Tesla beginning in May.",
      "Since Musk said he would refocus on Tesla, the EV maker's stock has surged 24%.",
      "\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead,\" Denholm added in her statement.",
      "On the April 22 earnings call, Musk acknowledged that his role in the Trump administration has \"some blowback.\" But he also praised DOGE's work in cutting what he claims is waste, fraud and abuse in government spending. The CEO added that he planned to continue spending one to two days a week at the group.",
      "While Musk has said he wants to trim $2 trillion in annual spending from the federal budget \u2014 an amount that experts says is unfeasible without cutting major entitlement programs like Medicare \u2014 the\u00a0DOGE website\u00a0says it has saved $160 billion so far.",
      "With the billionaire's energies focused in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, Tesla has increasingly been coping with pushback from consumers. Some Tesla owners sought to sell their vehicles\u00a0rather than be associated with Musk's political views. Across the world, Tesla dealerships have also been\u00a0targeted by protesters showing their opposition to DOGE.",
      "\"Musk said on the earnings call he will now be spending most of his time as CEO of Tesla as the global brand damage, political firestorm and perfect storm chaos over the past few months will hopefully now end this volatile chapter for the company,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives wrote in an April 30 research note.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-tax-cut-below-200000-income-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 May 2025 08:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says steep tariffs on U.S. imports will lead to lower taxes for Americans. Is he right?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump describes his administration's sweeping new tariffs on other countries as a tool for accomplishing a range of key economic goals, including reviving U.S. manufacturing. Recently, he's been highlighting another aim: lowering, or even eliminating, individual income taxes for most Americans.",
      "\"When Tariffs cut in, many people's Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" he wrote Sunday on Truth Social, his social media app.",
      "Tariffs are already kicking in, with businesses around the country facing import duties of 145% or more on imports from China and tariffs of 10% on goods shipped from almost every other nation. Many Americans say they disapprove of these import duties, which are typically passed onto consumers through higher prices, and are bracing for higher inflation as the costs trickle through the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump's comments also point to his earlier assertions that higher tariffs could raise more than $1 trillion in federal revenue in the next year or so. On Sunday, before boarding Air Force One to return from Pope Francis' funeral, Mr. Trump asserted that the revenue raised by his tariffs \"will be enough to cut all of the income tax\" in the U.S.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on whether the Trump administration is developing a proposal to cut taxes for most Americans.",
      "What's the link between tariffs and taxes?",
      "Currently, there is no tax bill in Congress \u2014 the arm of government with the authority to change the tax code \u2014 that would eliminate federal income taxes for people earning $200,000 or less. Even so, the House is working on a reconciliation bill that would extend Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add a few new reductions promised by the president on the campaign trail, such as eliminating taxes on employee tips.",
      "If passed, that bill would mean individuals would continue to pay the same tax rates they've paid since Mr. Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act took effect beginning for the 2018 tax year, with\u00a0individual tax brackets ranging from 10% to 37%, depending on a person's income. And if the legislation is enacted, notably, most Americans would see no difference in their federal income tax rate.",
      "\"There is no real connection\" between Mr. Trump's tariffs and lower taxes, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues. \"He has the authority to impose higher tariffs, and he's done that. But he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cut income taxes \u2014 that's done by Congress.\"",
      "There is \"zero chance\" that Congress would eliminate income taxes for a large swath of the U.S. population because the new tariffs won't generate enough revenue to replace the $2.4 trillion in income taxes\u00a0paid by American households each year, she added.",
      "Even if a president imposed 50% tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S. \u2014 or twice the current rate under Mr. Trump \u2014 the income generated would represent less than 40% of what income taxes bring in, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "Why tariffs can't replace income taxes",
      "Even the notion of eliminating income taxes for people earning less than $200,000 doesn't add up, York said. Here's why: Mr. Trump's tariffs could raise about $170 billion in revenue this year, while wiping out individual taxes for people earning less than $200,000 would forego $700 billion in tax revenue this year, she estimated.",
      "\"You would need tariffs multiple times higher than what we have now\" to generate the revenue to make up for the gap in lost taxes, York said. Making the math work is \"an impossibility,\" she added.",
      "Yet hiking taxes even more aggressively would heighten the risks of a U.S. recession, which would cause job losses, inhibit consumer spending, suppress business investment and further roil financial markets \u2014 all developments that reduce the government's tax receipts.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim about tariffs lowering taxes amounts to \"an argument that says, 'If Americans pay more out of their left pocket, the government will be able to put more in their right pocket,'\" said Joe Rosenberg, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, another think tank focused on taxes.",
      "\"Even if you make the math work, it's really replacing one form of tax with another \u2014 and the other important point here is these taxes have very different distributional effects across income types,\" he added.",
      "Translation: Tariffs take a bigger bite out of low- and middle-income Americans' budgets because they spend a larger share of their incomes on basics like food and household goods than compared with high-income Americans. A typical low-income household is likely to see their disposable income fall by 5.5% under Mr. Trump's tariffs, compared with 1.9% for the highest-earning families, according to a March 31\u00a0estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "But faced with higher prices for consumer goods, many households would cut back on spending, adding to the challenges of relying on tariffs to raise enough revenue to replace income taxes, experts say.",
      "Dueling goals",
      "Mr. Trump's move lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate to its highest since 1943\u00a0reflects conflicting aims, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For instance, the president has said he wants to use tariffs to secure better trade deals with other nations. Yet reaching new trade pacts with lower tariff rates would undercut the president's goal of relying on import duties to replace the federal income tax.",
      "Mr. Trump's back-and-forth on his tariffs, including temporarily rolling back some import fees and creating exclusions for certain products, also undermines the administration's ability to generate a new source of federal revenue, Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, told CBS News.",
      "\"If you are tariffs on, tariffs off, because of these negotiations that are supposedly going on, you're not raising much revenue, or protecting industry or getting new investment the United States because of all the uncertainty,\" Lincicome said.",
      "By dangling the prospect of a tax cut, Mr. Trump may be seeking to convince Americans to bear the brunt of the tariffs' impact, which economists say could slow U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"Americans are about to find out really fast that this is a tax on us,\" York noted. \"It will hurt our trading partners, too, but it is a tax that in large part falls on American businesses and American workers.\"",

      "A federal judge has strongly rebuked Apple, finding that the iPhone maker willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. On Wednesday, she found that Apple violated a 2021 injunction that, she wrote, sought to \"restrain and prohibit the iPhone maker's anticompetitive conduct\" and pricing.",
      "\"Apple's continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote in Wednesday's ruling, which held Apple in contempt.",
      "She ordered that Apple \"no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday night, an Apple spokesperson said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal.\"",
      "Epic first filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2020, alleging that Apple had built an illegal monopoly around its popular App Store that makes billions of dollars annually from a then-exclusive payment system that collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app commerce.",
      "Although Gonzalez Rogers had rejected the monopoly claims, she ordered Apple to lower the barriers protecting its previously exclusive payment system for in-app digital transactions and allow developers to display links to alternative options. The Supreme Court rejected Apple's appeal in the case in January 2024.",
      "\"In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option,\" the judge wrote on Wednesday. She accused Apple's vice-president of finance Alex Roman of \"outright\" lying under oath.",
      "\"Internally, (longtime Apple executive) Phillip Schiller had advocated that Apple comply with the injunction, but (CEO) Tim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him otherwise. Cook chose poorly,\" Gonzalez Rogers wrote.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",

      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",

      "The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.",
      "Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \"exceptional museum grade piece.\"",
      "\"Not only is it written by one of the most important first-class passengers on Titanic, Colonel Archibald Gracie, [but] the letter itself contains the most prophetic line: 'It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her,'\" Aldridge said in a statement.",
      "Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \"The Truth about the Titanic,\" an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.",
      "Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.",
      "The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",
      "Henry Aldridge & Son put up dozens of Titanic items up for auction this month, including a pocket watch and a third-class ticket belonging to two passengers who both died in the disaster.",
      "Pocket watches previously owned by Titanic passengers have sold for huge amounts at Henry Aldridge & Son's auctions before, with a bidder in November claiming one of them\u00a0for $2 million. The price of that item had broken a record set earlier in the year, when the same auction house sold a different gold watch for about $1.46 million. In that case, the 14-carat object belonged to the wealthiest passenger on the Titanic,\u00a0John Jacob Astor, whose net worth was around $87 million when the disaster happened in 1912.",

    "story": [
      "The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company is on its way to becoming an official city with a galactic name: Starbase.",
      "A vote Saturday to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by a small group of voters who live there and are mostly Musk's employees at SpaceX.",
      "Starbase is the facility and launch site for the SpaceX rocket program that is under contract with the Department of Defense and NASA, which hopes to send astronauts back to the moon and someday to Mars.",
      "Early results look favorable",
      "Musk first floated the idea of Starbase in 2021, and approval of the new city was all but certain. Of the 283 eligible voters in the area, most are believed to be Starbase workers.",
      "The unofficial\u00a0results on election night show 212 votes for the City of Starbase incorporation, or 100%, with Bobby Peden elected as mayor with 100% of the votes.",
      "The election victory was personal for Musk. The billionaire's popularity has diminished since he became the chain-saw-wielding public face of President Donald Trump's federal job and spending cuts, and profits at his Tesla car company have plummeted.",
      "SpaceX has generally drawn widespread support from local officials for its jobs and investment in the area.",
      "Musk's personal stake in the outcome",
      "But the creation of an official company town has also drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area, with potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches.",
      "Companion efforts to the city vote include bills in the state Legislature to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council.",
      "All these measures come as SpaceX is asking federal authorities for permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.",
      "The city at the southern tip of Texas near the Mexico border is only about 1.5 square miles (3.9 square kilometers), crisscrossed by a few roads and dappled with airstream trailers and modest midcentury homes.",
      "SpaceX officials have said little about exactly why they want a company town and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "\"We need the ability to grow Starbase as a community,\" Starbase General Manager Kathryn Lueders wrote to local officials in 2024 with the request to get the city issue on the ballot.",
      "The letter said the company already manages roads and utilities, as well as \"the provisions of schooling and medical care\" for those living on the property.",
      "Increased launch activity and beach closures",
      "SpaceX officials have told lawmakers that granting the city authority to close the beach would streamline launch operations. SpaceX rocket launches and engine tests, and even just moving certain equipment around the launch base requires the closure of a local highway and access to Boca Chica State Park and Boca Chica Beach.",
      "Critics say the beach closure authority should stay with the county government, which represents a broader population that uses the beach and park. Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino, Jr. has said the county has worked well with SpaceX and there is no need for change.",
      "Another proposed bill would make it a Class B misdemeanor with up to 180 days in jail if someone doesn't comply with an order to evacuate the beach.",
      "The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, which has organized protests against the city vote and the beach access issue, plan to hold another protest Saturday night as the polls close.",

Justice Department attorneys argue Colorado's policies allowed Tren de Aragua to seize control of the building.",

The president signed an executive order earlier this week calling on the Justice Department to investigate sanctuary cities that don't cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration policies in an effort to withhold federal funding from them.",
      "There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

      "\"Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion,'\" Howell wrote.",
      "She found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth and Sixth amendments to the Constitution.",
      "The decision from Howell, who sits on the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms that have been penalized by the president as a result of their associations with people and causes he disfavors. In addition to Perkins Coie, the firms Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey have also filed lawsuits challenging their respective executive orders.",
      "Perkins Coie represented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The executive orders are all similar. They call for the immediate suspension of any active security clearances held by firm employees. They direct government agencies to require contractors to disclose any business with the firms, require agency leaders to review all contracts with the firms or entities that do business with them, and limit firm employees' access to federal buildings and government workers.",
      "When taken together, Howell said the directives support Perkins Coie's assertion that Mr. Trump has mounted a campaign of \"using the power of the presidency to target individual lawyers and law firms associated with them based on personal dislike of their legal work \u2014 in other words, for retribution.\"",
      "Howell's ruling in favor of the firm was expected, since she appeared sympathetic to its bid to block Mr. Trump's directive during a hearing last month. She had previously blocked enforcement temporarily of the order's provisions on government contracting and access to federal buildings and personnel. Still, her decision is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president.",
      "While four firms have sought to fight Mr. Trump's executive orders targeting them in court, at least nine others have reached agreements with the White House to avoid being penalized by the president. The deals, announced by Mr. Trump on social media, include commitments to provide between $40 million and $125 million in pro bono legal work.",
      "Referencing these nine firms, Howell said they appear to have received Mr. Trump's suggestion that they may be subject to punishment unless they agree to his terms. One firm, Paul Weiss, was the subject of an executive order by the president that was rescinded after it agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services during Mr. Trump's term. Howell said that revocation \"demonstrates the coercive power of such targeting by the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"If the founding history of this country is any guide, those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written,\" she wrote in a footnote.",
      "Appointed by former President Barack Obama, Howell said the executive order targeting Perkins Coie \"stigmatizes and penalizes\" the firm and its employees \u2014 from partners to attorneys to mail room attendants \u2014 because of its past and current representation of clients who take positions that the president dislikes.",
      "Perkins Coie, Howell wrote, is neither employed by the government nor a contractor with it, but is instead a \"law firm representing some clients disliked by the president, engaging in some litigation seeking results disliked by the president, and operating its business, in part, in a manner disliked by the president.\"",
      "She said the case \"presents an unprecedented attack\" on the principles of the American judicial system.",
      "\"Here, the Trump administration's blunt exercise of power in EO 14230 to target Perkins Coie for adverse actions by every federal agency violates the Constitution in multiple ways,\" Howell wrote.",
      "The judge said that the executive order was issued as \"retribution\" for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's \"grievances,\" which she said he has publicly aired since 2017.",
      "Howell repeatedly characterizes the executive order issued by the president as a deliberate means of harming Perkins Coie. In finding that it violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, the judge wrote that \"settling personal vendettas by targeting a disliked business or individual for punitive government action is not a legitimate use of the powers of the U.S. government or an American president.\"",
      "Lawyers for Perkins Coie had argued during a hearing before Howell last month that Mr. Trump's executive order was unlawful retaliation and should be permanently blocked. The Justice Department, meanwhile, had urged the judge to dismiss the case.",

    "story": [
      "Australians are voting in a national election this weekend, and President Trump appears to be playing an outsized role as nations continue to respond to the vision of U.S. foreign policy he's put in place in the first 100 days of his second term.",
      "Polling stations on the eastern coast of the country, which includes Sydney and Melbourne, opened Saturday at 8 a.m. local time and close at 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET on Saturday). In Western Australia, which includes Perth, the poll closing time comes two hours later.",
      "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where Mr. Trump's influence was also felt. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 whose numbers spiked as he pushed back against tariff threats and Mr. Trump's jibes about annexing Canada into a \"51st state\" \u2014 crushed Pierre Poilievre's hopes to return the Conservative Party to power after a decade of Liberal Party rule.",
      "The center-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia led the polls for nearly a year and had seemed to be on a path to form a government. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, however, the coalition's support has plummeted, and it now trails the Labor Party by 4.4 points, according to YouGov.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton has run a campaign echoing Mr. Trump's messaging focusing on the economy. His Liberal Party, whose motto is \"Let's get Australia back on track,\" proposed cutting government waste and mandating federal workers return to the office.",
      "\"It was literally as if Dutton was copying what the United States government was doing, and I think as such, that ended up being enormously unpopular,\" Alan Tidwell, a professor of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific studies at Georgetown University, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "The economic downturn in Australia in recent years in the wake of the pandemic initially threatened center-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects of remaining in power. But Dutton's similarities to Mr. Trump and the U.S. president's growing unpopularity among the Australian public seem to have boosted Albanese's chances.",
      "Still, Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Mr. Trump, refraining from criticizing him directly. When asked during a debate last month whether he trusts Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Albanese said he had \"no reason not to\" trust either leader and said in a separate radio interview that he would speak with Mr. Trump after the election, should he win.",
      "\"I assure you I'm not staying up at night trying to ring anyone at the moment,\" Albanese said.",
      "But Tidwell told CBS News that even if tariffs were reversed, Mr. Trump's unpopularity in Australia would still impact the election. \"It's not saving Labor to the point where they can win an outright majority, but I think that they will win office with a minority government,\" he said.",
      "Australia is among several nations with which the U.S. does not have a trade deficit, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The two nations signed the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2004, and it took effect on Jan. 1, 2005. Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, asked U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer why Australia was included on Mr. Trump's tariff list.",
      "\"The idea we are going to whack friend and foe alike undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward,\" Warner said.",
      "The U.S. was Australia's second-largest trading partner after China in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While it is unclear if American tariffs would prompt China to fill the gap, Beijing's increased presence in the Indo-Pacific is considered a national security threat by Canberra.",
      "The Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security partnership",
      "Australia and the U.S., along with the U.K., also share a close national security relationship, known as AUKUS, which was formalized in 2021. The trilateral security partnership also allows Australia to obtain Virginia-class nuclear submarines, which are expected to join the Royal Australian Navy's fleet by the early 2030s.",
      "Nishank Motwani, senior fellow and director of alliance strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute USA in Washington, D.C., told CBS News that AUKUS matters a lot to Australia's defense capability, but it needs to show the Trump administration how Canberra is being a responsible ally when it comes to defense spending to counter China.",
      "\"With a more influential China, which is more coercive and aggressive in the way in which it is just carrying out its affairs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia needs to do more as a way to push back against China's ability to carve out its sphere of influence,\" Motwani said.",
      "As the Trump White House redefines America's leadership role abroad and imposes tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. \"to act responsibly in the world,\" according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, whose survey in April also noted this was a \"new low in two decades\" of its polling.",
      "\"The level of distrust has certainly shot through the roof,\" Tidwell said. \"But I think that Donald Trump's launch of the trade war and his other comments about Canada and the Panama Canal and Greenland have all really upset the apple cart, and Australians are really wondering, what does the future hold?\"",

      "President Trump's venture into crypto products has increased his family's wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a new report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The group State Democracy Defenders Action estimated in a new report that the president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family that launched in October 2024. State Democracy Defenders Action identifies itself as non-partisan, but it is overseen by frequent critics of President Trump, with an agenda focused on \"the autocratic threat to our nation.\"",
      "The president's net worth is expected to get another bump, with World Liberty Financial's announcement this week that a Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in the Trump family-affiliated crypto fund. The Emirati firm, MGX, will purchase $2 billion in a stablecoin product offered by World Liberty, the company said in a statement to CBS. The currency, called \"USD1\" will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.",
      "World Liberty has ties to the president and his sons. The fine print on the company's website says an entity affiliated with Mr. Trump and his family members own a 60% stake in the company.",
      "According to the company's public reports, a Trump family entity also holds 22.5 billion of the $WLF tokens \u2013- and takes an additional 75% in net revenue from future token purchases.",
      "Details of the MGX deal have not been released, so it is unclear how much the Trump family stands to benefit from this transaction.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, World Liberty said the deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.",

      "\"In terms of prior presidents in the modern age, they've all divested their assets, or they've rolled them over into what we call blind trusts,\" Canter said. \"President Trump did not do that in his first term, and it seems as if in the second term he's doubled down and he is all in (on) the crypto industry.\"",
      "The report leans heavily on past media reports, including a Fortune magazine article that reviewed the Trump family's financial disclosures and provided the original estimates of the president's net worth.",
      "Crypto companies are not legally required to disclose who is buying and selling on their platforms to the public, so little is known about who has invested in Trump family-affiliated crypto products.",

      "Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has made several moves to unwind the regulatory environment that many industry insiders say crippled crypto businesses.",
      "He has issued multiple executive orders to promote cryptocurrency, including one that seeks to promote the growth of digital currencies and another that instructed the Treasury Department to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.",
      "Mr. Trump has also used his office to pardon the three founders of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, who pleaded guilty in 2022 to failing to prevent money laundering on their platform, according to a report by Reuters.",
      "The value of Mr. Trump's crypto assets have at times fluctuated with his policy decisions and social media posts.",
      "The value of $TRUMP increased 18.1% in early March after the president issued an executive order promoting a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, according to the report. A few weeks later, on March 23, the president posted \"I Love $TRUMP\u2013 SO COOL!! The Greatest of them all!!!!\" on Truth Social, which led to an increase in the price of the meme coin from $10.93 to $12.24.",
      "Whether or not the $TRUMP coin increases in value, the president's business collects trading fees when people buy or sell the coin. A Reuters analysis found that business entities behind the $TRUMP coin could have made nearly $100 million in fees in less than two weeks of trading.",

      "The American Geophysical Union, the world's largest association of earth and space scientists, and the American Meteorological Society, the professional society for atmospheric and related sciences and services, announced they would be inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for what they said would be a \"first of its kind\" collection.",
      "The groups say their collection isn't meant to replace the National Climate Assessment, but would complement it, since the dismissal of hundreds of scientists suggests that the next National Climate Assessment may not be as extensive as the previous ones. The Trump administration is legally obligated to produce the assessment, but the White House told CBS News that it's evaluating the scope of the assessment that it will publish.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990.

    "summary": "A federal district court judge blocked DOGE from accessing sensitive information from the Social Security Administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have access to the sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration.",
      "The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court stems from an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland who limited DOGE's access to Social Security Administration system of records containing the personal information of millions of Americans.",
      "The judge concluded in her April decision that the plaintiffs, two labor unions and an advocacy group represented by Democracy Forward, were likely to succeed on their claim that the Social Security Administration's decision to give DOGE access to millions of Americans' confidential information violated the Privacy Act and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process.",
      "\"T]he issue here is not the work that DOGE or the agency want to do. The issue is about how they want to do the work,\" U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in her 145-page decision. \"The DOGE Team seeks access to the [personally identifiable information] that millions of Americans entrusted to SSA, and the SSA defendants have agreed to provide it. For some 90 years, SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records. This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.\"",
      "She did allow DOGE team members to have access to redacted or anonymized information from the Social Security Administration, but only if they met certain conditions, such as receiving trainings and undergoing background investigations.",
      "The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined a Trump administration request to halt that injunction, leading it to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In asking the high court to lift the district court's injunction, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that it is forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "\"The government cannot eliminate waste and fraud if district courts bar the very agency personnel with expertise and the designated mission of curtailing such waste and fraud from performing their jobs,\" he said.",
      "The solicitor general, who argues on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court, said that the plaintiffs who brought the case did not have the legal right to sue. Sauer also argued that the district court did not have the legal authority to issue sweeping relief, which he said harmed \"urgent federal priorities\" and thwarted the executive branch's functions.",
      "\"Employees charged with modernizing government information systems and routing out fraud, waste, and abuse in data systems plainly need access to those systems,\" he wrote. \"Yet the district court instead viewed agency employees within the SSA DOGE team as the equivalent of intruders who break into hotel rooms.\"",
      "The Trump administration has sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in at least a dozen cases, as more than 200 legal challenges targeting many aspects of second-term agenda move their way through the federal courts. But the legal battle over DOGE's access to Social Security data is the first directly involving the cost-cutting task force to land before the justices.",
      "President Trump\u00a0established DOGE\u00a0on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with leading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, U.S. Digital Service, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's attempts to access Americans' sensitive data at agencies including the Departments of Treasury and Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, have led to their own set of lawsuits claiming the task force's members have not been complying with the Privacy Act, the federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information.",
      "Musk's role in DOGE, too, has sparked a set of challenges that argue his actions violate the Constitution's Appointments Clause. A different federal judge in Maryland ruled in March that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution through its unilateral shut down of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed to pause that decision while it considers an appeal by the Trump administration.",

      "Roughly 2 million organizations have received tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, including charities like churches, environmental groups and universities. The designation means the groups are exempt from paying federal income taxes and the IRS considers donations to 501(c)(3) organizations to be tax-deductible.",
      "Harvard president Alan Garber expressed doubt about the legality of revoking the status.",
      "\"If the government goes through with a plan to revoke our tax exempt status, it would\u2026be highly illegal, unless there is some reasoning that we have not been exposed to that would justify this dramatic move,\" Garber told the Wall Street Journal. Tax-exempt status, he said, enables universities to carry out their missions of education and research.",
      "\"Obviously that would be severely impaired if we were to lose our tax exempt status,\" he said.",
      "The tax code prohibits executive branch officials from asking an IRS employee to conduct or terminate an audit or investigation into a specific taxpayer.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission. The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth. There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status,\" a Harvard spokesperson said in response to Mr. Trump.",
      "The spokesperson continued: \"Such an unprecedented action would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission. It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision is the latest in a series of moves targeting the university. His administration announced last month that it would be freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after the university rejected a series of demands made by the administration. Among the conditions were for Harvard to discontinue its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, positions and initiatives, change its hiring practices and change its leadership.",
      "After the Trump administration announced it would be freezing the funding to Harvard, the university sued and alleged the move was unlawful. It's likely a withdrawal of Harvard's tax-exempt status will prompt further legal action.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security also demanded Harvard turn over information on certain foreign student visa holders or risk losing its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. There were more than 6,700 international students enrolled at the school as of October, according to data from the university.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard in a letter to the school of creating a \"hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard's failure to condemn antisemitism.\"",
      "CBS News reported last month that the IRS was considering stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, and Mr. Trump told reporters that he believed the school was abusing the designation.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said last month that any \"forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the president\" and said \"investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior to the president's TRUTH,\" a reference to an earlier suggestion by Mr. Trump that Harvard lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Harvard has an endowment of $52.3 billion, the largest of all U.S. universities. The school provided more than $749 million in financial aid and scholarships in fiscal year 2024, and nearly one-third of funding that backs research at Harvard comes from the school.",

    "summary": "Army plans for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday in June include military vehicles and \"thousands\" of troops.",
    "story": [
      "The Army is planning for a potential military parade on President Trump's birthday on June 14 that would include \"thousands\" of troops, as well and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles, the White House and a defense official confirmed.",
      "According to planning documents obtained by the AP, the parade calls for over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands and possibly a couple thousand civilians.",
      "The documents, dated April 29 and 30, have not been publicly released. They represent the Army's most recent blueprint for its long-planned 250th anniversary festival on the National Mall and the newly added element \u2014 a large military parade that Mr. Trump has long wanted.",
      "The Army anniversary coincides with Mr. Trump's 79th birthday, which falls on June 14.",
      "A parade of this size is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars. The price would include moving the military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington, D.C., and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.",
      "High costs halted Mr. Trump's push for a parade in his first term, and the tanks and other heavy vehicles that are part of the Army's latest plans have raised concerns from city officials about damage to roads.",
      "Asked about plans for a parade, Army spokesman Steve Warren said Thursday that no final decisions have been made. Col. Dave Butler, another Army spokesman, said the Army is excited about the plans for its anniversary.",
      "\"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us,\" said Butler. \"We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\"",
      "Others familiar with the documents, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been finalized, said they represent the Army's plans as it prepares for any White House approval of the parade. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely. Much of the equipment would have to be brought in by train or flown in.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in on the military Thursday night, though he didn't mention plans for June 14. Writing on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said, \"We are going to start celebrating our victories again!\" He said he would rename May 8 \u2014 known as Victory in Europe Day \u2014 as \"Victory Day for World War II\" and change Veterans Day, on Nov. 11, to \"Victory Day for World War I.\"",
      "Some equipment and troops were already going to be included in the Army's birthday celebration, which has been in the works for more than a year. The festival was set to involve activities and displays on the National Mall, including a fitness competition, climbing wall, armored vehicles, Humvees, helicopters and other equipment.",
      "A parade, however, would increase the equipment and troops involved. According to the plans, as many as 6,300 of the service members would be marching in the parade, while the remainder would be responsible for other tasks and support.",
      "The Army's early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one.",
      "The plans say the parade would showcase the Army's 250 years of service and foresee bringing in soldiers from at least 11 corps and divisions nationwide. Those could include a Stryker battalion with two companies of Stryker vehicles, a tank battalion and two companies of tanks, an infantry battalion with Bradley vehicles, Paladin artillery vehicles, Howitzers and infantry vehicles.",
      "There would be seven Army bands and a parachute jump by the Golden Knights. And documents suggest that civilian participants would include historical vehicles and aircraft and two bands, along with people from veterans groups, military colleges and reenactor organizations.",
      "According to the plan, the parade would be classified as a national special security event, and that request has been submitted by the National Park Service and is under review.",
      "And it is expected that the evening parade would be followed by a concert and fireworks.",
      "One of the documents raises concerns about some limitations, which include where troops would be housed and \"significant concerns regarding security requirements\" as equipment flows into the city. It says the biggest unknown so far is which units would be participating.",
      "In his first term, Trump proposed having a parade after seeing one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Mr. Trump said that after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted an even grander one on Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "That plan was ultimately dumped due to the huge costs \u2014 with one estimate of a $92 million price tag \u2014 and other logistical issues. Among those were objections from city officials who said including tanks and other heavy armored vehicles would tear up the roads.",
      "Trump said in a social media post in 2018 that he was canceling the event over the costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.",
      "This year, as plans progressed for the Army to host its birthday festival in Washington, talk about a parade began anew.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledged in April that the administration reached out to the city about holding a parade on June 14 that would stretch from Arlington, Virginia, where the Pentagon and Arlington National Cemetery are located, across the Potomac River and into Washington.",
      "Bowser at the time said she didn't know if the event was being \"characterized as a military parade\" but added that tanks rolling through the city's streets \"would not be good.\"",
      "\"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said.",
      "In 2018, the Pentagon appeared to agree. A memo from the defense secretary's staff said plans for the parade \u2014 at that time \u2014 would include only wheeled vehicles and no tanks to minimize damage to local infrastructure.",

    "summary": "Ashli Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached a settlement with the family of Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed while in the mob breaching the House Speaker's Lobby on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News the settlement has been reached in principle but is not yet signed. In a court proceeding Friday, a plaintiff's attorney confirmed the settlement in principle was reached. It would avert a trial and further proceedings in a $30 million civil suit filed by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, including her late husband.",
      "Babbitt's death was a rallying point for Trump loyalists and Capitol rioters who alleged police used unnecessary force in stopping the mob on Jan. 6. In the civil lawsuit, Babbitt's estate alleged U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the issue of force and his firearm. The suit also argued Byrd was not in uniform and was wearing a COVID mask when he opened fire against Babbitt. The suit accused Byrd of failing to \"de-escalate.\"",
      "\"Ashli was unarmed,\" the lawsuit said. \"Her hands were up in the air, empty, and in plain view of Lt. Byrd and other officers in the lobby. Ashli posed no threat to the safety of anyone.\"",
      "The case, which was initially filed in California, was transferred to the Washington, D.C., federal court in 2024 and was defended by the Justice Department under the Biden administration.",
      "In a 2024 court filing, the department argued, \"Ms. Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. She made her way to the east doors of the Speaker's Lobby situated immediately behind the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, the site of Joint Sessions of Congress. Although officers had barricaded the Speaker's Lobby doors with heavy furniture, demonstrators broke through the glass panels of the lobby doors and matching windows (called \"sidelights\") on either side of the doors.\"",
      "It went on to say, \"Michael Byrd, a U.S. Capitol Police lieutenant, was positioned on the other side of the lobby doors. When Ms. Babbitt, wearing a backpack, tried to climb through a sidelight into the Speaker's Lobby, Lt. Byrd fatally shot her.\"",
      "In an August 2021 internal review, the U.S. Capitol Police said Byrd saved lives and did not engage in misconduct.",
      "\"This officer and the officer's family have been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats for actions that were taken as part of the job of all our officers: defending the Congress, Members, staff and the democratic process,\" the review said. \"The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away.\"",
      "Footage from Jan. 6 shows Babbitt trying to climb through a smashed window as the mob sought to breach the House Speaker's Lobby, where the counting of the electoral votes had been interrupted. Members of Congress were evacuating the area during the riot.",
      "Babbitt's mother, Micki Wittehoff helped lead a nightly protest outside the Washington, D.C., jail for more than two years, in defense of U.S. Capitol riot defendants and convicted felons. Wittehoff's advocacy helped secure meetings with then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, references to Babbitt by President Trump and a selfie photo with Kash Patel, who later was confirmed as the director of the FBI.",
      "Hours after he was inaugurated, the president issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants. The Justice Department has fired prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 cases.",
      "Last month, Brendan Ballou, one of the Jan. 6 prosecutors who resigned after Trump took office told CBS News the pardons and firings were an effort to whitewash history.",
      "\"The goal here is to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,\" Ballou said. \"There are enormous number of politicians whose whole careers now depend on that day being forgotten because if it's remembered, people will realize they are supporting a president that tried to incite an insurrection and overthrow the peaceful democratic transfer of power. And so there's a concerted effort by these folks to make sure that that history is forgotten, and firing those prosecutors is part of that effort.\"",

      "President Trump's budget proposal would cut 22% of non-defense discretionary spending next year while significantly increasing defense spending, according to a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget and information provided by the White House.",
      "The president's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would slash non-defense discretionary spending by $163 billion from current levels, the official told reporters on a conference call Friday, while defense spending would surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever. The president's budget proposal, along with efforts by the White House and Republicans to claw back some federal funding already authorized by Congress, would solidify cuts championed by the White House's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\"This is a pretty historic effort to deal with the bureaucracy that you have heard and seen such action from our administration with DOGE to be able to deal with the bureaucracy that we believe has grown up over many years to be entrenched against the interests of the American people,\" the senior OMB official told reporters on a conference call Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "The president's proposed budget would put all discretionary spending at $1.7 trillion, down from $1.83 trillion in the current fiscal year, and increase defense spending by 13%, the official said. The president's budget recommendation would have the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2017, or, adjusted for inflation, the lowest non-defense discretionary spending since 2000, the official said.",
      "The White House isn't yet saying what their deficit or revenue projections will be. The president's recommendation is in the hands of the Republican-controlled Congress, which is responsible for crafting and passing a budget.",
      "On average, agencies would see about 35% in cuts, although some entities, like the Department of Homeland Security, would see more funding under the proposal. Entities including the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services would see significant cuts under the president's proposal.",
      "The senior OMB official said the president's budget proposal includes \"an enormous cut to foreign aid, but one that still preserves substantial presence\" to provide for \"targeted\" aid when it's in the interest of the United States.",
      "But spending on things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to be the biggest drivers of the federal deficit and national debt, and those programs, along with interest on the debt, are taking up an increasingly large piece of the federal spending pie.",
      "A senior administration official said the president has been \"very, very involved\" in the budget proposal process.",
      "\"Obviously, this president's budget, he's very, very involved throughout the process,\" the official told reporters on the conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We had four years of budgets to build on and come into office, see the damage that the Biden administration has wrecked on our fiscal house, and to make updates and incorporate many of the changes that have been identified from DOGE and come to you with a proposal.\"",

      "The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass.",
      "The rule\u00a0tied to the Clean Air Act\u00a0was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\"",
      "The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls.

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court\u00a0on Wednesday appeared divided over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "Eight of the nine justices are considering the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself. Following arguments, it seemed likely that the outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program during the arguments. If the Supreme Court deadlocks 4-4, it would leave intact the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which ruled that the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh appeared most sympathetic to St. Isidore's argument that excluding it from Oklahoma's charter school system unconstitutionally discriminated against the school.",
      "Kavanuagh said religious institutions can't be treated as \"second class\" and said keeping sectarian schools from operating charter schools, when the program is open to nonreligious private entities, seems like \"rank discrimination\" based on religion.",
      "\"They're not asking for special treatment. They're not asking for favoritism. They're just saying don't treat us worse because we're religious,\" he said of the school.",
      "But the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, seemed concerned that a decision allowing the religious charter school would weaken the wall between church and state.",
      "\"The state is running these schools,\" Kagan said. Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\"",
      "But there was some concern about how a ruling allowing St. Isidore's to be established as a religious charter school would impact the systems in other states, and specifically the level of oversight and control over them. Justice Neil Gorsuch warned such a result could lead states to impose more requirements on charter schools, such as mandating public officials to serve on their boards and boosting state involvement in their creation.",
      "\"Have you thought about that boomerang effect?\" he asked James Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, which joined St. Isidore's in the case.",
      "A decision will follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Citing those decisions, Roberts said the programs at issue in Missouri, Montana and Maine were also creations and creatures of the state. But he also said they involved \"fairly discrete\" state involvement, as opposed to the \"much more comprehensive involvement\" of Oklahoma in funding and overseeing its charter schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "Gregory Garre, who argued on behalf of Drummond, said that St. Isidore's is seeking special status compared to secular charter schools, because it said it can only comply with laws that are consistent with its constitutional rights as a religious school under the direction of the Catholic Church.",
      "He warned that a decision in favor of the school would render the laws in nearly all states and the federal charter school program unconstitutional because they all require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Such an outcome would \"create uncertainty, confusion and disruption\" for the millions of charter school students across the country.",
      "He warned that allowing religious institutions to participate in state charter school systems would open the door to more litigation over issues like who can be admitted, who can teach at the schools and over their curriculum.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing.",
      "Campbell, who argued on behalf of the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board, told the justices that St. Isidore's was created not by the state, but by two Catholic organizations, and it's controlled by a privately selected board of directors.",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers for St. Isidore's and the charter school board said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Barrett's recusal from the case could create a situation in which the Supreme Court renders a 4-4 decision, leaving the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling intact. She did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, though it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",

    "summary": "The National Climate Assessment, a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the U.S., is scheduled for publication in 2027.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 400 scientists across the United States were informed Monday afternoon that their services were no longer needed to help write a major report on climate change for the federal government.",
      "The report, known as the National Climate Assessment, is a major publication produced every four years that summarizes the impacts of climate change in the United States, and it is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The sixth edition is scheduled for publication in 2027 and preparations have been underway for months to meet that deadline.",
      "The National Climate Assessment is the basis for which federal, state, and local governments, as well as private companies, can prepare for climate change impacts, understand future projections of climate risk, as well as learn to adapt and mitigate those challenges.",
      "An email sent to participants from the deputy director of services of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal office that organizes the publication of the report read, \"Thank you for your participation in the 6th National Climate Assessment ... we are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles.\"",
      "According to the email, the \"scope\" of the assessment is being \"reevaluated\" as the Trump administration looks to comply with the law, something the White House also reaffirmed to CBS News.",
      "But many in the scientific community are concerned about how the report will be written without the subject matter expertise of the hundreds of scientists and researchers, many of whom were non-federal employees voluntarily working on the report in service of the government.",
      "\"The Trump administration has dismissed all the scientists from their work on the nation's most important climate change report,\" Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. \"Refusing to study climate change won't make it go away \u2014 or help us deal with stronger storms, droughts, floods, wildfires and hotter temperatures, or help us stop emitting the pollution that is making it worse.\"",
      "The move doesn't come as a major surprise as Project 2025 outlined a plan to reshape the report and the office that organizes it, the U.S. Global Change Research Program. In Project 2025, a policy roadmap outlined by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president, authors argued that bureaucratic offices like USGCRP should not have so much control and reports like NCA should include \"diverse viewpoints.\"",
      "The steps to accomplish this were laid a few weeks ago when many federal employees of the USGCRP were fired, according to a Politico report, and the contract for outside work to publish the NCA was canceled in early April.",
      "When asked how scientists feel about their expertise no longer being needed, most said they expected the news.",
      "\"I feel badly for the federal leaders who have put a lot of time into this, but to some extent, I think the writing was on the wall when they dismissed the support staff a few weeks ago,\" said Dr. Robert Kopp a climate scientist and professor at Rutgers University, who was also working on the current assessment. \"I think now it's clear, many of the authors would like to see an up-to-date evidence based report.\"",
      "How an independent report can be published outside the purview of the federal government remains to be seen. Dr. Kopp says independent fundraising would need to occur to help support the report's publishing as it requires a lot of time, energy, and resources to organize the efforts of hundreds of volunteer scientists who write the content.",
      "Failing to publish a report of record that stands up to rigorous scientific review of past national assessments is significant, says Dr. Mijin Cha, a climate and environmental justice professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz and a fellow author on this year's assessment.",
      "\"We're losing our status as the premiere data and research country,\" Dr. Cha said.",
      "Many in the scientific community have begun to talk about how to move forward, but fears remain that the Trump administration will proceed with its own report, assigning authors that represent alternative viewpoints on climate change.",
      "\"I'm worried who will do the NCA moving forward and putting something forward that is false,\" said Dr. Cha.",
      "Because the Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates the NCA to be written, the Trump administration is legally obligated to abide by the law and has until the end of 2027 to produce the sixth version of the report.",

    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",
      "The interactive map below shows where different broods are scattered across the country.",
      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

The new discovery revealed the important role played by women in the oldest center of civilization in the Americas, researchers said.",
      "\"What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,\" archaeologist David Palomino told AFP.",
      "The mummy was found in Aspero, a sacred site within the city of Caral that was a garbage dump for over 30 years until becoming an archaeological site in the 1990s.",
      "Palomino said the carefully preserved remains, dating to 3,000 years BC, contained skin, part of the nails and hair and was wrapped in a shroud made of several layers of fabric and a mantle of macaw feathers. Macaws are colorful birds that belong to the parrot family.",

That reflector will receive data from the world's forests, the ESA said.",
      "Forests on Earth collectively absorb and store about 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually, the ESA said. That regulates the planet's temperature. Deforestation and degradation, especially in tropical regions, means that stored carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, the ESA said, which can contribute to climate change. There's a lack of accurate data on how much carbon the planet's estimated 1.5 trillion trees store and how much human activity can impact that storage, the ESA said.",
      "To \"weigh\" the planet's trees and determine their carbon dioxide capacity, Biomass will use a P-band synthetic aperture radar. It's the first such piece of technology in space. The radar can penetrate forest canopies and measure woody biomass, including trunks, branches and stems, the ESA said. Most forest carbon is stored in these parts of the trees. Those measurements will act as a proxy for carbon storage, the ESA said.",

      "In Smith's case, an image of her was doctored to create explicit pictures and videos, with her face edited onto different, partly nude bodies, and then used to try to extort money from others. \"Sextortion\" scams like this one have targeted tens of thousands of Americans in the past year alone, according to the FBI.",
      "\"I cry myself to sleep most nights, mostly because I don't want my kids to see me,\" said Smith, who is 43. She recalled first learning about the images in an email, which included a screen grab of an exchange between the sender and an \"impersonator\" posing as the doctored version of her on the internet.",
      "The deepfakes quickly multiplied, accompanying offers for private dinners and intimate acts in exchange for hundreds of dollars, and targeting anyone who might recognize Smith. She began to keep track of new accounts using the deepfake in a Google spreadsheet \u2014 and added 24 over the course of just one week, among hundreds that she says have emerged online. A fabricated video also surfaced where a deepfake claims to be Smith.",
      "\"You're basically taking someone's identity,\" she said. \"You're weaponizing them.\"",

And last week, a bill Smith backed passed in the Tennessee Senate. The bill, called the \"Preventing Deepfake Images Act,\" was sent to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who is expected to sign it into law. It provides a path for people targeted by sextortion scams to sue if images of them are shared without their consent.",

      "\"I try my best to catch the imposters and block them, but like I said, there have been hundreds of them. It's like whack a mole, they just appear everywhere,\" Smith told lawmakers. \"I'm just supposed to look at them and say, 'nothing we can do, bud?'\"",
      "There were over 34,000 victims of sextortion in 2023, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. That number climbed to more than 54,000 victims last year. The FBI said financial sextortion, which differs from typical sextortion as it involves an offender threatening to release explicit material unless a payment is met, has been on the rise in the U.S. and targeting minors.",

      "IBM on Monday announced that it will invest $150 billion in U.S. manufacturing to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The investment will include more than $30 billion that will go toward research and development to allow the computing giant to continue manufacturing its mainframe and quantum computers in the U.S.",
      "\"Technology doesn't just build the future \u2014 it defines it,\" said Arvind Krishna, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer in a statement Monday. \"We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities.\"",
      "IBM's mainframes are\u00a0manufactured in Poughkeepsie, New York.",
      "The investment comes as President Trump implements a sweeping tariff regime aimed at encouraging companies to expand their manufacturing\u00a0footprint in the U.S. Although not all the companies pledging to expand in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such corporate commitments as wins.",

    "summary": "Investigators say the suspicious timing of doing a load of laundry and a call to 911 focused their attention on a former state trooper and his potential role in his wife's death.",
    "story": [
      "When former Idaho State Trooper Dan Howard called 911 from his home in Athol, Idaho, on the night of Feb. 2, 2021, he was crying so much that it was hard to understand what he was saying.",
      "\"My wife ... she shot herself,\" Dan Howard told the operator. \"She's in the bathtub dead ... I go upstairs and she's dead. She's dead ... she's gray, she has no pulse, nothing ... she's cold.\"",
      "Dan Howard later told authorities that he had been downstairs and heard something hitting the floor upstairs. Dan Howard said that when he went upstairs over an hour later, he found his wife of 26 years, Kendy Howard, in a bathtub filled with water with a gunshot wound to her head.",
      "The case \u2014 starting from the hours after Kendy's death to a surprising final twist \u2014 is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"The Bathtub Murder of Kendy Howard.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, May 3 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Kootenai County Sheriff's Deputy Miranda Thomas was one of the first responders to arrive at the Howards' home that night. Thomas later described how Dan Howard was \"screaming, yelling, asking us for help ... sobbing, gagging, just overall kind of freaking out.\"",
      "Also on the scene that night was Kootenai County Sheriff's Detective Jerry Northrup. Northrup confirmed the 911 call was dispatched as a suicide, but recounts that it did not take long for his team to grow suspicious.",
      "\"For a woman to shoot herself in the tub, nude, is unusual,\" said Northrup. \"It doesn't mean it can't happen \u2014 it just means that it's unusual.\"",
      "There was also other evidence at the scene that stuck out to investigators. According to Northrup, there was broken glass found in the primary bedroom, and Kendy Howard's clothing thrown on the floor. There were wet towels behind the bathroom door, and when investigators first arrived at the scene, they reported that the water in the tub was still warm to the touch. Thomas noticed a packed duffle bag filled with women's clothing lay at the bottom of the stairs, and that the shirt Dan Howard was wearing seemed to have fresh deodorant stains.",
      "One of the more intriguing clues, say investigators, was a load of laundry mid-cycle in the dryer. Thomas took note: \"A washer or dryer doesn't run for very long, 45 minutes, maybe an hour, so when was this washer and dryer started?\"",
      "Northrup had the same thought and recorded the time left on the dryer cycle: six minutes. He told Van Sant how he pulled up the cycle running times from the manufacturer's website and compared the information against the time at which the 911 call was placed.",
      "Northrup determined that the dryer cycle would have started at 10:42 p.m. and the 911 call came in at 10:43 p.m. Meaning, says Northrup, Howard started the laundry cycle about a minute before calling 911. But why?",
      "Investigators continued digging, and after reviewing the evidence with medical and scientific experts, came up with a theory as to how Dan Howard could have killed his wife.",
      "Dan Howard was arrested in April 2023, and in March 2024, went on trial for the murder of his wife.",

      "Peter Van Sant: Inconsistent, suggesting it might not be a suicide?",
      "Det. Jerry Northrup: Correct. \u2026 Everything started directing us to the path that this was a staged crime scene.",

I think if anybody's going to know what the sound of a gunshot is from inside a residence, it's going to be Dan Howard.",

      "Investigators focused in on an alarming incident Dan Howard was involved in from 2013, when he was still a state trooper. Dan had found out Kendy was having an affair with a neighbor \u2014 who also happened to be Dan's good friend. Enraged, Dan confronted him at his office.",

He was allowed to resign from the Idaho State Police. After that, Kendy's friend Michelle Lampert says the couple's relationship seemed to change.",
      "Michelle Lampert: She was stuck to him like glue, just like glue, like hanging all over him. And she was never that way before. .. I think back, going, was she scared?",

      "Michelle Lampert: She was a totally different person \u2026 I think she realized the more she was free, the more she loved life. And she didn't have to be under his thumb.",

      "Then, just four nights before Kendy Howard's death, deputies were called to the Howard home. Kendy's mother had asked for a welfare check, after hearing a panicked Kendy on the phone. A visibly nervous Kendy answered the door.",

      "The deputy helped Kendy leave the house. But investigators would later say they couldn't arrest Dan Howard because Kendy never told deputies Dan had physically harmed her. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Julia Schoffstall later learned that Kendy had told friends what had happened.",
      "Julia Schoffstall: She wakes up in early morning hours to Dan standing over her \u2026 wearing dark clothes \u2026 black latex gloves \u2026 a pillow in his hand \u2026 the look in his eyes \u2026 it was a look that she had never seen before and that she wholeheartedly believed in that moment that he was going to kill her.",

      "Peter Van Sant: What's the tragedy in this case to you? The biggest tragedy of all?",
      "Julia Schoffstall: That she was so close to getting out.",
      "In the text messages to Kendy, Dan Howard said it was all a misunderstanding and he was willing to work things out. But there were other signs he wasn't OK. The day before Kendy's death, her brother Brian Wilkins took a long road trip with Dan.",
      "Brian Wilkins: He started asking me about who Kendy was having an affair with.",
      "Brian Wilkins says Dan Howard figured out Kendy was seeing the real estate agent who was helping her buy that new house near her hometown.",
      "Brian Wilkins: You could tell, he was mad.",
      "The next day, Kendy Howard was dead. To prosecutors, the circumstantial evidence against Dan Howard was adding up. After reviewing Kendy's autopsy and photos taken of Kendy's body, investigators discovered that, in fact, Kendy had multiple bruises all over her body.",
      "Stan Mortensen: Her body was riddled from head to toe with bruises and some lacerations.",
      "And her jaw had been broken.",
      "Stan Mortensen: I believe that Kendy was beat severely by Dan.",
      "So what really happened that night? The theory that Kendy's death scene could have been staged began to take on a new light.",
      "Stan Mortensen: Kendy did not die from a gunshot wound \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: Wait, wait. Stop. She was shot, I understand, in the mouth \u2026 the bullet lodged in her vertebrae. And it didn't kill her?",
      "Stan Mortensen: Exactly. We believe that Kendy was already dead when she was shot.",
      "HOW DID KENDY HOWARD DIE?",
      "Julia Schoffstall: Dan always had a level of control over Kendy. And I think by February 2nd, he had realized that that control was gone.",
      "Weeks into the investigation, prosecutors believed the circumstantial evidence showed Kendy Howard died at the hands of Dan Howard. But with the medical examiner's ruling that Kendy had died from a gunshot wound, and no DNA evidence linking Dan Howard to Kendy's gun, prosecutors faced challenges. So, they called in other experts to take a second look at the evidence, including forensic pathologist Dr. Jennifer Nara.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: I\u00a0looked at the autopsy report, I reviewed all the photos \u2026 all the X-rays, the toxicology results \u2026 I did not agree with the original cause of death, that she died from a gunshot wound at the head.",
      "Nara walked \"48 Hours\" through her analysis.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: When \u2026 I looked at what the trajectory was, the path the bullet took inside Kendy's mouth, I thought that was unusual \u2026 cause it was going in a slightly downward direction. Typically in gunshot-wound suicides, they go either straight back to the mouth or go slightly upward.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And can you demonstrate the path of this bullet?",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara (demonstrating):\u00a0 Yeah, I sure can. So, I have a skull model here \u2026 I'm gonna take this rod to show the direction that the bullet traveled through the mouth, through the tongue. \u2026 and it tore through the tongue \u2026 like a torpedo. \u2026 it just went through the center of the tongue.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Would there have been a lot of blood?",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: Absolutely. \u2026 it's gonna bleed like crazy.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Because the heart is beating at the time that the bullet went through that tongue.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: Exactly.",
      "But, when Nara reviewed the photos of the crime scene, she says she didn't see the amount of blood she would have expected to.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: There was not enough blood.",
      "And there were those bruises on Kendy's body and her broken jaw, which Nara says were sustained before Kendy had died.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Injuries that \u2014 that suggested a physical struggle of some sort.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: Correct. \u2026 She's got bruises throughout her body. She's got bruising on both sides for her neck, which is consistent with her being possibly choked.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What did you conclude?",
      "Dr. Jennifer Nara: I believe that \u2026 Kendy Howard was already dead when she sustained that gunshot wound. \u2026 she was already strangled or choked to death. And when she was placed in the bathtub, she was already dead.",
      "So, how then did Kendy die? Prosecutors say Dan Howard used a restraining technique he learned back in his days as a state trooper.",
      "Julia Schoffstall: We believe that he utilized a technique known as a carotid restraint.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Show me how it works.",
      "Stan Mortenson\u00a0(demonstrates): So, what you would do is, you'd place your arm around somebody's neck and head, and their chin is gonna be in the crook of your elbow.",
      "Prior to becoming an attorney, prosecutor Stan Mortenson had been a sheriff's deputy, and, like Dan Howard, had been trained in administering the carotid restraint hold \u2014 rarely used, as it cuts off blood flow to the brain.",
      "Stan Mortenson:\u00a0If it's applied too long, it can cause death. \u2026 And that right there was our theory on how Dan killed Kendy.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's an interesting theory, but you do concede it is a theory, right? \u2026 no witness came forward to say that Dan told me he did this or \u2026 there's no physical evidence that proves that he did this, right?",
      "Stan Mortenson: Not the carotid restraint technique, correct. \u2026 but Dan knew how to use this technique and taught other people how to use it. So, we weren't just grabbing this theory out of thin air. This was something that Dan actually knew.",
      "It took two years for the prosecutors to build their case. Finally, in April 2023, Dan Howard was charged with murder. He was also charged with domestic battery from that incident seven months before Kendy's death, when she took those photos of her bruises and sent them to her friend Michelle Lampert. He pleaded not guilty and posted bail. Dan Howard was ordered to wear an ankle monitor while he awaited trial.",
      "In his opening statement, prosecutor Stan Mortenson said Dan and Kendy Howard had fought over finances that night, and it turned physical, with Dan bruising Kendy, breaking her jaw, then killing her with the carotid restraint hold. Then, he said, Dan Howard staged the scene by placing Kendy's body in the bathtub and shooting her.",
      "STAN MORTENSEN (in court): Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence will come in and will demonstrate that this was not a suicide. \u2026 Evidence will show that Kendy died of asphyxiation. \u2026 Evidence will show that Dan Howard is guilty of murder.",
      "Dan Howard's lawyer, Jason Johnson, countered the state's claims by asserting that an emotionally troubled Kendy Howard has shot herself.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): She is struggling with whether she wants to leave Dan.",
      "He pointed out that Dan Howard's DNA was not even on Kendy's gun.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): The gun had Kendy's blood on it. \u2026 But Dan is excluded.",
      "And he dismissed the State's assertion there was a physical fight that night.",
      "Jason Johnson:\u00a0Kendy did not have any \u2026 DNA under her fingernails. \u2026 there were no defensive marks on Dan.",
      "Johnson also said the investigators were all wrong about the lack of blood at the scene, pointing out that several hours had passed before some of the crime scene photographs of the bathtub had been taken and some of the water could have drained.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): How much blood went down that drain?",
      "Johnson attacked the prosecution's claim that Kendy Howard was dead from asphyxiation before she was shot by calling that medical examiner who performed Kendy's original autopsy.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): Your cause of death is gunshot wound?",
      "DR. JOHN HOWARD (in court): That's my opinion.",
      "More than a week into the proceedings, the trial recessed for a long weekend break. That night, prosecutors learned of a new, dramatic development that seemed to be right out of a television crime show. It seemed Dan Howard was making a run for it.",
      "WAS DAN HOWARD MAKING A RUN FOR IT?",
      "With his trial winding down, Dan Howard, who was out on bail with an ankle monitor, suddenly took off.",
      "Peter Van Sant: This was the great escape. He was hoping to get away?",
      "Stan Mortenson: He did it right after we finished with all of our evidence.",
      "A deputy was tracking Dan Howard that night.",
      "Stan Mortenson: You know, this is I-90, going 70 miles-an-hour. He abruptly took an exit and then got back on the highway \u2026 you know, looking in his rear-view mirror, \u00a0\"is somebody following me?\"",
      "About an hour later, Dan Howard made it to the Spokane International Airport.",
      "Peter Van Sant: He's right there at the airport terminal.",
      "Stan Mortenson: He's right there at the airport terminal. Dan was taken out of the car. He was put into handcuffs.",
      "Dan Howard claimed he had gone there to help a friend return a rental car \u2014 not to make a run for it.",
      "Stan Mortenson: And I think it's possible that he was gonna cut the ankle monitor off, leave it in his car and then drive away in another rental car.",
      "Instead, Dan Howard's drive was a short one back to a jail cell in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho. His bail was revoked. Days later, the prosecution made closing arguments.",
      "JULIA SCHOFFSTALL (in court): Ladies and gentlemen, the state has shown you \u2026 this was not suicide 'cause a dead person cannot shoot themselves in the mouth.",
      "The jury was not told about Dan Howard's escape attempt. His defense attorney insisted that Kendy took her own life.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): The scene is consistent with suicide.",
      "And that Dan Howard did not have the skills to \"stage\" a murder scene.",
      "JASON JOHNSON (in court): There's no evidence that he worked as a detective. No evidence that he had any sort of homicide training. Uh, no evidence of the knowledge of staging a scene.",
      "After 10 days of trial, 62 witnesses and just over eight hours of deliberations, the jury reached a verdict: guilty of second-degree murder.",
      "Brooke Wilkins: I cried. There was \u2014 I think I gasped that \u2014 there was crying and \u2014",
      "Peter Van Sant: And did you look at Dan?",
      "Brooke Wilkins: I'm looking at him and as he turns there's just \u2014 there's no expression. There's no look of remorse.",
      "Dan Howard had shown no emotion. But two months later at his sentencing, he begged the judge for leniency.",
      "DAN HOWARD (in court): \u00a0I love my wife, and I miss her. (cries) And \u2026 I am not that monster, I assure you, that, um, people have portrayed me to be. Kendy and I had, um, 28 years together. And, um, raised a family. Had mostly a good marriage and a good life. \u2026 I'm not that animal that they portray me to be. \u2026\u00a0 It is not my intention to anger the court or disrespect the process that, uh, I used to believe in \u2026 But, your Honor is about to sentence an innocent man to prison.",
      "But the judge wasn't moved.",
      "JUDGE LAMONT BERECZ (in court): What we know beyond a reasonable doubt is that you strangled your wife. You murdered her. And then you staged her naked body in the bathtub, shot her through the mouth, and tried to pass this off as a suicide. \u2026 You killed a mother. You killed a grandmother. You killed a sister. \u2026 You snuffed that out because of your own pride, greed, and anger.\"",
      "\"Pride, greed, and anger,\" said the judge. But others kept coming back to the word \"control.\"",
      "Julia Schoffstall: To me, this case was about a man who thought that he could control a woman. \u2026 And if he couldn't get his way, he was going to force it.",
      "Brooke Wilkins: I cried. \u2026 it's such a relief. \u2026 that \u2026 people got to hear what actually happened.",

    "summary": "Catina Salarno's sister, Nina Salarno, became a prosecutor in California to warn others about a common tactic abusers use.",
    "story": [
      "When 18-year-old Catina Rose Salarno arrived at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, to begin her freshman year in September 1979, she thought she was starting life anew. She had broken up with her high school sweetheart, Steven Burns, and was excited to pursue her dream of becoming a dentist. But on her first day of college, he surprised her by showing up on campus. He asked to meet her for one last time later that evening, said Catina Salarno's college roommate, Joanne Marks.",
      "\"She was not looking forward to meeting with him, but she was looking forward to it being the last time,\" Marks told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty in this week's all-new episode,\u00a0\"The Boy Across the Street,\" now streaming on Paramount+. \"She believed that he would stop bothering her,\" said Marks.",
      "Around 8 p.m. that evening, Burns led Catina Salarno to a dark and secluded part of campus to talk about their relationship. But when she refused to get back together with him, he pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Catina in the back of the head, leaving her to slowly bleed to death.",
      "\"My whole world got taken from me in, really, the flash of the gun, I mean, everything was gone. My life was never the same again,\" Catina Salarno's youngest sister, Nina Salarno, told \"48 Hours.\" She was only 14 years old when Burns was convicted of second-degree murder in 1980, but her sister's death and its aftermath changed the course of her life.",
      "Nina Salarno went on to become a prosecutor specializing in domestic violence cases and has served as the district attorney in Modoc County, California, since 2023. \"I chose \u2026 to make that my career because I believed, like my sister, so many victims are either not heard, afraid to be heard, or just don't understand the magnitude of what's happening to them,\" she said.",
      "In 1977, Burns and his family moved across the street from the Salarnos' San Francisco home, and a romance blossomed between Catina Salarno and Burns \u2013 both sophomores in high school. While Catina Salarno attended the all-girls high school, Burns became the captain of his school's football team. Burns had a strained relationship with his own father, and the Salarnos took him in as one of their own. He was someone each member of the family grew to trust.",
      "By the end of their senior year, Catina Salarno wanted to break off their romantic relationship. When she started to pull away from Burns, his demeanor towards Catina became more aggressive, said Nina Salarno. And that behavior continued to escalate. Both of Catina's sisters told \"48 Hours\" about troubling incidents when Burns had threatened to kill Catina. But Nina Salarno said Catina never took those threats seriously. Neither did her sisters.",
      "\"We just figured he was just saying it. And because of what our relationship was over the years, why would we believe that?\" Catina's middle sister, Regina Salarno-Novello, told \"48 Hours.\" \"He enjoyed being part of the family. Why would he destroy a family that he loved?\"",
      "Nina Salarno said it's common for victims to miss the warning signs.",
      "\"I think this is what's really hard for domestic violence victims \u2014 they really don't think the person's gonna kill them \u2026 in a lot of the situations they think \u2026 they know this person \u2026 And I think that's exactly what happened with Catina is she just figured his comment was just his comment. Even though he had made threats, she could handle it, 'he's never gonna cross that line' type thing,\" she said.",
      "Which is why Catina Salarno agreed to meet Burns that night, Nina Salarno said.",
      "\"I think she gained strength as she was leaving the relationship \u2026 she was not gonna let him ruin where she was headed or interfere with her life anymore. And so that's why I believe she went out to meet him,\" Nina Salarno said. \"And I think she did probably one of the most courageous acts. But also in the history of domestic violence in relationships, it's the most dangerous time. And unfortunately, she was killed.\"",
      "According to Nina Salarno, once an abuser starts to feel like they have lost control over their partner, she says that is when the highest rate of injury or murder occurs in a domestic violence relationship. Nina Salarno emphasizes the importance of avoiding these \"last time\" encounters by urging victims to make a clean break from their abuser and avoiding situations where they might be alone with them.",
      "\"I think the biggest thing that a victim needs to realize is once they make that break, you've gotta make that break. Don't go meet them by yourself, don't take the phone calls, don't take the texts. Cut it off,\" Nina said. \"Everything you can do to prevent being one-on-one with that person.\"",

      "Nina Salarno: Then there was a sound like he fell, and it was a very distinct sound of metal hitting metal.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What do you think now, when you look back on that, that sound of metal against metal?",
      "Nina Salarno: I think if I had opened the window and he got in, there'd be three dead girls.",

      "Nina Salarno: Absolutely.",
      "Six months after Catina's death, 19-year-old Steven Burns went on trial for her murder. It was a bitter awakening for the Salarnos, who say there was more concern for the defendant and his rights than there was for his victim. Neither of Catina's parents were allowed in the courtroom\u00a0 \u2014 not even while Nina, who was only 14 years old at the time \u2013 took the stand. She had to testify at the trial on her own without a victim's advocate to support her.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What was that like on the stand?",
      "Nina Salarno: Ugh. \u2026 I think the best word was just awful. I was in a courtroom. The only person I knew in the courtroom was the guy that had murdered my sister.",
      "The prosecution argued that Burns met Catina that night carrying the stolen gun with the intention of killing her if she wouldn't continue their relationship. Still, the jury did not convict him of premeditated first-degree murder. He was found guilty of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 17 years to life with the possibility of parole.",
      "Nina Salarno: We all thought 17 years to life meant life \u2013 that they would never let him out.",
      "They would learn they were wrong. Just 10 years into his sentence, Steven Burns came up for parole. The Salarnos were outraged. In 1990, they talked to then-\"48 Hours\" correspondent Bernard Goldberg the night before the first parole hearing:",
      "MIKE SALARNO:\u00a0He should be in prison the rest of his life\u2026",
      "HARRIET SALARNO: I had no idea the parole system was so rotten.",
      "BERNARD GOLDBERG: OK, Steven Burns was handed down a 17-to-life sentence.",
      "HARRIET SALARNO: That's right.",
      "BERNARD GOLDBERG: And \u2014 and here we are 10 years later \u2014",
      "HARRIET SALARNO: That's right.",
      "BERNARD GOLDBERG: But you \u2014 you don't want him out after 17 years, after 20 years, after 25, you \u2014 is that fair?",
      "HARRIET SALARNO: Oh, that's a very fair question. Absolutely, I don't want him out, but I don't even wanna go up there before 17 years because that's what I was told!",
      "Going into this hearing, they know there's a chance he could get out.",
      "On March 28, 1990, the Salarnos and a bus full of supporters headed to Steven Burns' parole hearing.",
      "MIKE SALARNO (to Goldberg): That bus ride was the longest ride in my life. The first hardest thing was when she died, this is the second.",
      "For the first time since Catina's murder, the Salarnos confronted the man they had once considered part of the family.",
      "MIKE SALARNO (parole hearing): Steve sentenced my daughter to death forever. I ask for a fair trade. I ask you to sentence Steve to life in prison.",
      "Then it was Burns' turn to speak.",
      "STEVEN BURNS (parole hearing): It's hard to say the words how difficult it is to live day to day about the feelings I have inside about what I did. Regardless of what I do, I can't bring Catina back. \u2026 But I know this that I am deeply sorry for what I did. And I will work each day of my life, whether it be in prison or out \u2014 outside to make up.",
      "He apologized, but the Salarnos noticed he never looked at them while he did it.",
      "NINA SALARNO: If you can't look at someone in the face and say you're sorry, then you know damn well you're not sorry.",
      "After an excruciating wait, the parole board came back with a decision. Steven Burns was found unsuitable for release, but he would get another chance at freedom in just two years.",
      "HARRIET SALARNO (1990): Two years, we got two years. And I feel very, very drained, and I know my family's so worn out.",

      "There's something else you can be sure of. Every time Steven Burns comes up for parole, they will be there.",
      "Nina Salarno: We all said we would be back and we've continued to be back 12 times, not just because he murdered Catina, but because he is a dangerous murderer that will kill or harm again. And that's just the bottom line.",
      "In January 2025, they were about to go to their 13th parole hearing.",
      "NINA SALARNO (praying at gravesite): Give this family the strength to continue to fight.",
      "That fight for victim's rights has shaped all their lives.",
      "Regina Salarno-Novello: Was I gonna be a nurse 40 years ago? No. And now I am \u2026 the reason why I did it is because I swore nobody would die alone.",
      "Nina says she was so traumatized by the trial, she vowed she would become a prosecutor. And so she did. She became a specialist in domestic violence cases.",
      "Nina Salarno: I believed like my sister, so many victims are either not heard, afraid to be heard, or just don't understand the magnitude of what's happening to them.",
      "She became the DA in Modoc County \u2013 cowboy country \u2013 about as far north in California as you can get.",
      "Nina Salarno: Being able to be out in the mountains and/or, um, work on a cattle ranch or ride my horses and have that time is just \u2014 it's who I am.",
      "Harriet went on to start\u00a0Crime Victims United, an organization that has changed hundreds of laws. Before Harriet Salarno, victims in California weren't allowed to give impact statements at sentencing. Now they are. Parents \u2013 even if witnesses \u2013 can now attend the trial. And children, unlike Nina, must now be accompanied by a support person when testifying.",
      "Nina Salarno: She's my hero. \u2026 my absolute hero. \u2026 it's just so significant to see \u2026 how she supports people and just really fights for what's right.",
      "Harriet Salarno: I have a passion.",
      "For Harriet that has meant fighting to keep Steven Burns behind bars.",
      "Harriet Salarno: I've been doing it for 45 years and I will continue to do it. \u2026 As long as I'm alive and as long as he's in prison.",
      "Burns has been in prison for 45 years. But the Salarnos are convinced he hasn't changed.",
      "Nina Salarno: He still has yet to admit to \u2026 the facts of the crime.",
      "Burns' story, says Deputy District Attorney Robert Himelblau, has changed at least 12 times over the years.",
      "Robert Himelblau: He had said repeatedly that Catina pulled the gun, that Catina was the one who had the revolver, ignoring the fact that we knew that he had stolen Catina's father's revolver. \u2026 sometimes she shot him, sometimes they struggled over the gun and it accidentally went off.",
      "In 2016 \u2013 37 years after the murder \u2013 Burns finally stopped lying about Catina's actions, says Nina. He told the commissioners, \"I became very, very angry \u2026 and I pulled out a gun and shot Catina.\" But Burns continued to deny that he stalked her to UOP to kill her if she didn't get back together with him.",
      "Nina Salarno: The shooting of the gun murdered my sister, but the behaviors and the need for his power and control, and the obsessiveness is what makes him dangerous.",
      "And according to a complaint brought up at the last parole hearing, he has shown those same obsessive behaviors inside prison. A professor who taught incarcerated students reported that Burns' behavior towards her was quote disturbing and manipulating.",
      "Nina Salarno: He was relentless towards her because she would \u2026 not allow him into a class. He focused on her and was not going to stop till he got what he wanted.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you think that if Steven Burns is released, he could hurt someone?",

      "Anderson worked with Burns in mock hearing sessions to help him prepare for the upcoming parole hearing.",
      "Kevin Anderson: We had to push him. And once we got him to get off of the denial on certain issues where the real honesty had to come out, now he's able to talk about it in the honest terms that maybe he wasn't able to do 10 years ago, 15 years ago.",
      "Anderson says Steven told him he snapped when Catina rejected him.",
      "Kevin Anderson: She said, I want you to stay away from me and my family. \u2026 and he said, at that point I just lost it. \u2026 And as he was describing this, he was crying. \u2026 'cause now he realizes where he was going with this, and what this was leading to.",
      "And Catina saw it too, says Anderson.",
      "Kevin Anderson: He described to me her body language, what her eyes were doing, how they had just grown really big. I said, what else? And he said \u2026 her voice was shaking. \u2026 And I said, and what did that mean to you? And he would say, it meant she was scared to death.",
      "But it didn't stop him. Steven Burns shot the woman he claimed to love in the back of the head and walked away, leaving her to slowly bleed to death.",

      "While Buffett said it is best for trade to be balanced between countries, he doesn't think Mr. Trump is going about it the right way with his widespread tariffs. He said the world will be safer if more countries are prosperous.",
      "\"We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,\" he said.",

      "Buffett said he just doesn't see many attractively priced investments that he understands these days, but he predicted that one day Berkshire will be \"bombarded with opportunities that we will be glad we have the cash for.\"",
      "The meeting attracts some 40,000 people, including celebrities and well-known investors. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in attendance this year. Clinton was the last candidate Buffett backed publicly, before backing away from politics and other controversial topics for fear of hurting Berkshire's businesses.",

    "summary": "Laid-off employees ranged from those working in firefighter health programs, to those approving new respirators.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly all of the remaining staff at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were laid off Friday, multiple officials and laid-off employees told CBS News, gutting programs ranging from approvals of new safety equipment to firefighter health.",
      "Much of the work at NIOSH, an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had already stalled after an initial round of layoffs on April 1 at the agency ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "New requests for investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards had already stopped being accepted. A CDC plan to help Texas schools curb the spread of measles infections was also scrapped due to the layoffs.",
      "NIOSH was started in 1970 as part of the same law that created another federal agency called the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. In addition to its own voluntary recommendations for employers, NIOSH produces research to inform OSHA's regulations and enforcement.",
      "NIOSH employees receiving layoff notices late Friday included some workers for the World Trade Center Health Program, miner safety, and firefighter health programs. Some workers for those programs had been asked to temporarily return to work for another month or two, after pleas from members of Congress.",
      "Among the layoffs to NIOSH's World Trade Center Health Program were nurses and scientists, two CDC officials said. Staff dealing with enrollment, member services and other administrative duties were also cut.",
      "Layoff notices received by workers Friday were almost identical to those received in the initial round of Kennedy's cuts, which said that their duties \"have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "The main difference with Friday's layoff notices was the date they take effect: workers are being put on leave until an official separation from service on July 2, instead of in June.",
      "The layoffs also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This NIOSH division had been the government body tasked with vetting safety equipment like N95 masks and breathing devices used by emergency workers.",
      "The laboratory's respirator approval program had been in the middle of processing around 100 applications for personal protective equipment, one laid-off official said.",
      "Stalled work includes changes needed to meet new standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association for this year. No equipment is currently certified to meet those standards, nor has the agency been able to issue refunds to application fees paid for by manufacturers.",
      "Efforts to spot and warn of counterfeit personal protective equipment was also halted due to the layoffs, officials said.",
      "\"Millions of workers across various sectors - including healthcare, construction, and emergency services - depend on NIOSH-approved respirators. Without these approvals, their safety is compromised, leading to potential illness, injury, or even death,\" laid-off employees wrote in a letter shared with CBS News.",
      "HHS responds to NIOSH layoffs",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday, asking what would happen to the agency's work now that most of its teams had been eliminated. The department had previously said that NIOSH would be absorbed into a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "In\u00a0a post Saturday on X, the department said that firefighter programs were still a top priority and that as \"the agency continues to streamline operations, the essential services provided by NIOSH will remain fully intact and uninterrupted.\"",
      "The department also claimed no CDC employees had been terminated on Friday and only a \"required notice was sent to NIOSH employees, following the agreed-upon standard process with the union.\"",
      "Laid-off NIOSH workers told CBS News that the department's post was misleading, since workers represented by unions were still on the job until Friday, when they received letters from HHS informing them of the layoffs and that they would be locked out of the agency's buildings.",
      "That capped a process which started\u00a0in late March, after unions received a notice saying that most NIOSH employees could be cut by the end of June. In the past, unions could use that time to negotiate with the department, allowing employees to continue to work during talks that might mitigate or avoid a \"reduction in force\" of their members.",
      "However, unions were unable to initiate negotiations with Kennedy's department to head off the layoff notices Friday.\u00a0 An executive order issued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challenged in court.",

      "A playdate between the world's tallest and smallest living dogs went the way of most dog park encounters, despite the 3-foot height difference \u2014 lots of tail wagging, sniffing and scampering.",
      "Reginald, a 7-year-old Great Dane from Idaho, and Pearl, a chihuahua from Florida, are both certified winners in their respective height titles by Guinness World Records. The fact that Reginald is the size of a small horse and Pearl is as small as an apple didn't stop them from getting along famously.",
      "Pearl, a 4-year-old who stands at 3.59 inches, comes from a long line of short dogs. Her aunt Millie, a previous record-holder in the same category, until she died in 2020, was also under 4 inches tall.",
      "Both Millie and Pearl weighed 1 ounce at birth.",
      "\"I was not expecting to once again have the record,\" said Vanesa Semler of Orlando, Florida, owner of both tiny dogs. \"That would be like unbelievable.\"",
      "Guinness arranged the two-day meet-up between Pearl and Reginald \u2014 who also goes by Reggie and measures in at a whopping 3-foot-3\u00a0\u2014 last month at his home in Idaho Falls.",
      "Even though Pearl loves dogs, even big dogs, Semler said she was anxious because of Reginald's size.",
      "\"For me, (it) was a huge, pleasant surprise from day one because Reggie is like Pearl, in bigger size,\" she said. \"He is so gentle, so friendly.\"",
      "Reggie, for his part, might have been more interested in the Guinness film crew that accompanied Pearl than the tiny dog herself.",
      "\"I would say he likes people a little bit more than he likes other dogs,\" said Sam Johnson Reiss, his owner.",
      "Pearl's tiny size was also strange for the big boy.",
      "\"He was like very cautious, like a little anxious,\" Reiss said. \"He was very careful, like he didn't step on her or anything or anything crazy. He was just very aware that she was there.\"",
      "Reggie's super size was evident early on, especially on a dog park visit when he towered over other Great Danes despite being only 9 months old.",
      "\"They would be shorter than him, and they were like full-grown,\" Reiss said.",
      "There might have been a little jealousy shown over toys and beds, but Reggie and Pearl found common ground during their two days roaming the Idaho farm together.",
      "\"I think she found a good friend,\" Semler said.",
      "Semler said Pearl is her prima donna, with the chihuahua even picking out the clothes she wants to wear every day by placing her paw on the outfits laid out before her. That comes in handy when news crews are lining up for interviews.",
      "\"For us, she was always our diva,\" Semler said. \"Now she's a diva for everyone.\"",
      "Pearl doesn't have the top diva title quite yet, with Reiss saying Reggie \u2014 who has a new Instagram account \u2014 has his own diva moments.",
      "\"He's pretty high maintenance,\" Reiss said. \"Reggie's just cheeky, like he's kind of mischievous and silly and definitely tells you when he wants something.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and the architect of ChatGPT, is behind a venture that wants to solve a modern-day problem: proving you're human amidst a proliferation of bots and artificial intelligence.",
      "The startup, called World (formerly Worldcoin), is launching in the U.S. with the distribution of 20,000 tech devices called Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. After confirming a person's humanity, World then creates a digital ID for users that proves their personhood, distinguishing them from a bot or AI program that can mimic human behavior.",
      "The device, which looks like something out of \"Black Mirror,\" may seem ironic coming from Altman, given that its purpose is to help people stand out from the very same types of technology he helped develop. But World's backers say the Orb and its \"proof of personhood\" is addressing a problem that can stymie everything from finance to online dating: bots impersonating people.",
      "The Orb \"is a privacy-first way to prove you are a human in the world of AI and bots,\" said Jake Brukhman, co-founder of CoinFund, one of the project's earliest backers. \"That is getting relevant as AI is becoming much more prevalent in the world.\"",
      "U.S. rollout follows international debut",
      "World isn't exactly new, as it debuted outside the U.S. in 2023 and has already sparked privacy backlash, with Kenya's government shutting down the service, according to the Associated Press. Other jurisdictions followed suit, including Hong Kong and Spain.",
      "\"I will say that upon the launch in 2023 there was a lot of noise about this,\" Brukhman said. \"But a lot of noise came from the lack of understanding about the Orb and how it works.\"",
      "The Orb doesn't store any biometric data, he added. The device takes photos to ensure a person is human, but then stores that info on the user's device, not in the Orb, according to World's website.",
      "World also has a link to cryptocurrencies, as the Orb's human-verification process is designed to be used in the World App, which is a digital wallet that gives people access to decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The time is right for a rollout in the U.S., Brukhman said, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under Trump administration. President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, is working on a \"crypto strategic reserve\" for the nation.",
      "The Orbs will be rolled out in stores in six U.S. cities, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco, as well as at gaming retailer Razer, with the idea that people can go to physical locations to get themselves verified as human.",
      "\"It takes a founder of the brand and acumen of a Sam Altman to really do digital identity,\" Brukhman said. The U.S. rollout \"will massively bolster the adoption of registered users on the network.\"",

In the afternoon, they will process into the Sistine Chapel, hear a meditation and take their oaths before casting their first ballots.",

If there is a winner, the ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke.",

      "The quake hit at 8:58 a.m. local time and was followed by at least a dozen aftershocks. Chilean authorities issued an evacuation alert for the entire coastal section of the Strait of Magellan, in the far south of the country, as a precaution.",
      "\"We call for evacuation of the coastline throughout the Magallanes region,\" Chile's President Gabriel Boric posted\u00a0on social media after an emergency service\u00a0alert, which also ordered evacuations in the nearby Antarctic areas.",

    "story": [
      "Australians are voting in a national election this weekend, and President Trump appears to be playing an outsized role as nations continue to respond to the vision of U.S. foreign policy he's put in place in the first 100 days of his second term.",
      "Polling stations on the eastern coast of the country, which includes Sydney and Melbourne, opened Saturday at 8 a.m. local time and close at 6 p.m. (4 a.m. ET on Saturday). In Western Australia, which includes Perth, the poll closing time comes two hours later.",
      "Australia's vote comes just a week after Canada's elections, where Mr. Trump's influence was also felt. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 whose numbers spiked as he pushed back against tariff threats and Mr. Trump's jibes about annexing Canada into a \"51st state\" \u2014 crushed Pierre Poilievre's hopes to return the Conservative Party to power after a decade of Liberal Party rule.",
      "The center-right Liberal-National Coalition in Australia led the polls for nearly a year and had seemed to be on a path to form a government. Since Mr. Trump took office in January, however, the coalition's support has plummeted, and it now trails the Labor Party by 4.4 points, according to YouGov.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton has run a campaign echoing Mr. Trump's messaging focusing on the economy. His Liberal Party, whose motto is \"Let's get Australia back on track,\" proposed cutting government waste and mandating federal workers return to the office.",
      "\"It was literally as if Dutton was copying what the United States government was doing, and I think as such, that ended up being enormously unpopular,\" Alan Tidwell, a professor of Australian, New Zealand and Pacific studies at Georgetown University, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "The economic downturn in Australia in recent years in the wake of the pandemic initially threatened center-left Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects of remaining in power. But Dutton's similarities to Mr. Trump and the U.S. president's growing unpopularity among the Australian public seem to have boosted Albanese's chances.",
      "Still, Albanese has embraced a moderate approach to Mr. Trump, refraining from criticizing him directly. When asked during a debate last month whether he trusts Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Albanese said he had \"no reason not to\" trust either leader and said in a separate radio interview that he would speak with Mr. Trump after the election, should he win.",
      "\"I assure you I'm not staying up at night trying to ring anyone at the moment,\" Albanese said.",
      "But Tidwell told CBS News that even if tariffs were reversed, Mr. Trump's unpopularity in Australia would still impact the election. \"It's not saving Labor to the point where they can win an outright majority, but I think that they will win office with a minority government,\" he said.",
      "Australia is among several nations with which the U.S. does not have a trade deficit, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The two nations signed the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement in 2004, and it took effect on Jan. 1, 2005. Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, asked U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer why Australia was included on Mr. Trump's tariff list.",
      "\"The idea we are going to whack friend and foe alike undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward,\" Warner said.",
      "The U.S. was Australia's second-largest trading partner after China in the 2023-24 financial year, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. While it is unclear if American tariffs would prompt China to fill the gap, Beijing's increased presence in the Indo-Pacific is considered a national security threat by Canberra.",
      "The Australia, U.K. and U.S. trilateral security partnership",
      "Australia and the U.S., along with the U.K., also share a close national security relationship, known as AUKUS, which was formalized in 2021. The trilateral security partnership also allows Australia to obtain Virginia-class nuclear submarines, which are expected to join the Royal Australian Navy's fleet by the early 2030s.",
      "Nishank Motwani, senior fellow and director of alliance strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute USA in Washington, D.C., told CBS News that AUKUS matters a lot to Australia's defense capability, but it needs to show the Trump administration how Canberra is being a responsible ally when it comes to defense spending to counter China.",
      "\"With a more influential China, which is more coercive and aggressive in the way in which it is just carrying out its affairs in the Indo-Pacific, Australia needs to do more as a way to push back against China's ability to carve out its sphere of influence,\" Motwani said.",
      "As the Trump White House redefines America's leadership role abroad and imposes tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. \"to act responsibly in the world,\" according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, whose survey in April also noted this was a \"new low in two decades\" of its polling.",
      "\"The level of distrust has certainly shot through the roof,\" Tidwell said. \"But I think that Donald Trump's launch of the trade war and his other comments about Canada and the Panama Canal and Greenland have all really upset the apple cart, and Australians are really wondering, what does the future hold?\"",

      "In conversations with chief of staff Susie Wiles, Waltz was offered several ambassadorships, including that of ambassador to Saudi Arabia. After some consideration, Waltz chose the job of U.N. ambassador. Mr. Trump announced the change in a social media post several hours after news broke Thursday morning that Waltz would be departing his job.",

      "The president has set his sights on including Saudi Arabia in the Abraham Accords, which was his first-term signature series of bilateral diplomatic accords. The agreement normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states. As president, Joe Biden also attempted to bring the Saudis into the fold in exchange for U.S. security guarantees and a civil nuclear program, but the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza complicated those efforts.",

      "CDC WARNS OF INCREASE IN INVASIVE STRAIN OF STREP THROAT IN US",
      "This problematic bacterial strain is easily treated with penicillin drugs when it causes a clinical infection, Osowicki told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview. (See the video at the top of this article.)",

      "In those cases, he said, the patients need ICUs, surgery and \"the most intensive treatment we have to offer.\"",

      "Fox News contributor Bill Bennett comments on the latest in the Trump administration\u2019s removing Harvard's tax exemption status and more on \u2018Fox News @ Night.\u2019",
      "An adjunct professor at Harvard spoke out Thursday after the Ivy League university\u2019s president, Alan Garber, apologized as scathing internal reports exposed that antisemitism and Islamophobia were prevalent on campus.",
      "Eugene Litvak, who teaches at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that one of the nation\u2019s top universities \"was not ready\" for the\u00a0anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic behavior that has plagued Harvard since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "\"Obviously, I was really, really upset,\" Litvak told Fox. \"What happened at Harvard after October 7th, and [at] the university, in my opinion, again, that's my personal opinion, the university was not ready to face these kinds of challenges. None of the universities were ready.\"",

      "\"I'm commending, actually, the letter from the president of the university,\" the Harvard professor added. \"What I really like, in science, we say that you cannot solve any problem unless you formulate it. So he formulated the problem in his letter. He acknowledged that there is a problem. Otherwise, nothing would happen.\"",
      "Harvard president Alan Garber\u00a0apologized in a letter Tuesday after internal reports unveiled antisemitism and Islamophobia\u2019s presence at the Ivy League school. Garber described the findings as \"disturbing.\"",
      "HARVARD PRESIDENT APOLOGIZES FOR FAILURE TO ADDRESS ANTISEMITISM, ISLAMOPHOBIA AFTER NEW REPORTS RELEASED",
      "\"I think that's a step in the absolutely right direction,\" Litvak told Fox News Digital. \"I would like to see the fruits of it. But again, I was very, very pleased because of the acknowledgment that there is such a problem.\"",
      "Despite Garber\u2019s apology and admission,\u00a0President Donald Trump posted to Truth Social Friday stating that the administration will be \"taking away Harvard's Tax Exempt Status,\" noting \"It's what they deserve!\"",
      "The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism. (AP Images)",
      "In addition to solving the troubling culture of one of America\u2019s top universities, the Harvard School of Public Health professor also stressed the importance of addressing the imminent danger publicly funded healthcare programs like Medicaid and Medicare face. Litvak, who serves as President and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Optimization (IHO), noted that the\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE) cuts to the government would not harm the programs.",
      "\"I think Medicare and Medicaid are facing danger, regardless of what DOGE is doing,\" Litvak explained. \"Medicare actually is going to become insolvent in 2036. It's very close. And Medicaid is not in the best position. I can tell you, we have, last year we had 4.9, this year I believe we would have more than $5 trillion spending.\"",
      "DR. OZ VOWS TO 'WAGE WAR ON FRAUD, WASTE, ABUSE,' PRESERVE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID",
      "The professor stated that reducing government spending, similar to DOGE cuts, on healthcare can be a solution to the looming crisis.",
      "\"I agree with the goal to reduce waste. It was a very timely call for waste reduction. It's much-needed, the Harvard professor added. \"Before doing that, if I were making decisions, before firing people, I would say, \u2018how can we improve the efficiency of what we already have?\u2019\"",
      "Litvak said he supports the move to \"reduce waste.\" (Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "While Litvak pushes for change in the public healthcare space, a dark cloud continues to hang over the Boston-based university as tensions between the Trump Administration and the Ivy League school have shown no signs of cooling down.",
      "A lawsuit over $2.2 billion in frozen research grants is still ongoing, and the funds may likely be held up into the summer. Harvard president Alan Garber said the \"consequences\" of the decision to withhold grants would be \"severe and long-lasting\", and may impact work similar to that which Professor Litvak is hoping to accomplish.",

I think there\u2019s a lot of tough fights going on,\" Sherrill told supporters during a campaign event at Ridgeway Volunteer Fire Company Station 34 in Manchester Township on April 26, according to the New York Post.",
      "Sherrill, 53, was first elected to the U.S. House in the 2018 midterms, winning the state's 11th congressional district that had long been considered a Republican stronghold. She voted for both of Trump's impeachments during his first administration.",

      "The administration purports that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, although a judge previously granted him a form of protected status known as \"withholding of removal\" after finding that he would likely be a target of Salvadoran gangs if deported to his native country. Democrat lawmakers, many legal experts and other critics of the move to send Abrego Garcia to the Salvadoran prison say this was done without giving him the opportunity to exercise his due process rights.",

      "Trump's \"unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service,\" Thanedar said in a statement when introducing articles of impeachment against the president.",
      "Sherrill explained at her event how Democrat-led states could challenge Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\"I was on the floor on January 6th. And he has no intention of leaving in four years \u2014 zero,\" Sherrill said, as Trump has floated the idea of bending the constitutional rules to run for a third term.",
      "\"It\u2019s up to, again, all of us to make sure that we are there, mobilizing, bringing people together as he\u2019s trying to divide us apart, finding ways around and, kind of, to block and tackle in the states,\" Sherrill said.",

      "\"He's been able to thread the needle really, really well between traditional conservative foreign policy voices and the more populist America First policy voices,\" the Florida GOP source said of Waltz.",

      "Waltz, who previously represented Florida\u2019s 6th congressional district, is a retired Army National Guard colonel and former Green Beret who served four deployments to Afghanistan and earned four Bronze Stars \u2014 the fourth-highest military combat award, issued for heroic service against an armed enemy.",
      "While Waltz and Hegseth both were embroiled in the Signal chat discussing strike plans against the Houthis, Hegseth has attracted more of the heat, at least publicly, stemming from the incident. Democrats have called for Hegseth\u2019s resignation as a result of the chat, but staffers at the White House \u2014 including Waltz \u2014 have openly backed Hegseth and shut down reports that the administration is seeking his replacement.",
      "But Waltz could get his turn attracting the ire of lawmakers as Democrats find an opportunity to openly grill him in front of the Senate, amid displeasure with Trump\u2019s foreign policy and national security agenda.",

      "\"President Trump\u2019s consistent hirings, firings and upheaval sap morale from our warfighters and intelligence officers, degrade our military readiness, and leave us less prepared to respond to threats from our adversaries,\" Coons said. \"American citizens at home and around the world are less safe because of President Trump\u2019s non-existent national security strategy.\"",

Fire and investigate them all.\"",
      "In addition to the Signal chat, Waltz\u2019s exit from the White House was tied to several other issues. For example, Axios reports that Waltz treated White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles like \"staff,\" and his disrespect rubbed her the wrong way.",
      "\"He treated her like staff and didn't realize he's the staff, she's the embodiment of the president,\" a White House official told Axios. \"Susie is a deeply loyal person and the disrespect was made all the worse because it was disloyal.\"",
      "Waltz reportedly discussed different roles he could take on following his stint at the White House with Wiles, according to CBS News. Waltz was reportedly offered jobs, including the ambassador to Saudi Arabia, but ultimately settled on U.N. ambassador.",

      "NEXT STEPS",
      "With Waltz out as national security advisor, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily step into that role.",

      "While the exact timeline for a potential confirmation vote in the Senate is unclear, the first hurdle that Waltz must clear is a confirmation vote out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although it is uncertain when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will schedule the nomination hearing for Waltz and the subsequent vote, the committee said his nomination is a \"priority.\"",

That means that Waltz could take a few months off, start the confirmation process in June or July and wrap up his confirmation by September at the latest, the source said.",
      "\"He's got plenty of time.

      "But there are a few Republican wildcards in the Senate who have voted against several of Trump\u2019s nominees, most prominently Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who voted against Hegseth, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer.",

      "Aside from former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whom Trump initially nominated to serve as attorney general, Trump\u2019s entire cabinet has been approved. Gaetz withdrew his nomination amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into sexual misconduct and drug-use allegations.",
      "Despite opposition from Democrats, and possibly a few Republicans, it appears unlikely that any fire that Waltz will face will sink his nomination.",
      "\"The reality of it is, the president can lose three votes in the Senate, and the vice president can still vote to break a tie,\" the Florida GOP source said. \"There's no way he's probably going to lose three votes.\"",

      "\"Donald Trump has fired a lot of people,\" Vance said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier Thursday. \"He doesn\u2019t give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterward.

      "If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

      "Manual opt-outs demand a significant time investment, requiring you to personally navigate each data broker\u2019s unique removal process. While free, this approach offers variable coverage depending on how diligently you track down brokers, and consistency is challenging; you\u2019ll need to repeat the process regularly to keep your data private. Success also depends heavily on your ability to decipher vague opt-out instructions and adapt to each broker\u2019s requirements.",
      "In contrast, data removal services save time by handling the legwork for you. They provide broad coverage by targeting numerous brokers simultaneously and maintain consistency through ongoing monitoring. While these services come with subscription fees, they eliminate the need for personal expertise, offering a hands-off solution to data privacy.",
      "The bottom line: Why personal data removal services win the privacy battle",
      "After testing both manual opt-outs and automated services, using a personal data removal service emerges as the clear solution for reclaiming your data. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If you\u2019ve got the time and patience, you can absolutely take the DIY route. But if you\u2019re looking for a way to protect your privacy without sinking hours into research, filling out forms and monitoring, a data removal service makes things a lot quicker and more convenient. For most people, this is likely the better option. Many states have privacy laws that give you the right to request that data brokers remove your personal information, but the system seems to be rigged to make exercising those rights unreasonably difficult.\u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t be necessary, data removal services offer a way to cheat that system.",

It's very easy to get worked up when you're in the middle of this situation. If it happens, you can always say you will get back to them and hang up the phone. If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up.",
      "2. Avoid unknown contact numbers:\u00a0Never call phone numbers that appear in pop-ups, unsolicited texts or emails. These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out.",

This launch transitioned\u00a0Project Kuiper from prototype testing to full-scale deployment. Each satellite was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including phased array antennas for high-speed data transmission, advanced processors, electric propulsion systems for orbit adjustments and optical inter-satellite links to enable seamless communication between satellites.",
      "In addition to their technical sophistication, the satellites featured a unique dielectric mirror coating designed to scatter sunlight and reduce their visibility from Earth, a thoughtful innovation aimed at addressing concerns by astronomers about light pollution.",

The launch vehicle included five solid rocket boosters alongside its main booster and a massive payload fairing measuring 77 feet in height and 16.4 feet in width.",
      "The successful deployment of these satellites was just the first of many planned launches. Over the coming years, ULA will conduct additional missions using both Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur rockets.

Once the satellites separated from the rocket, control was transferred to Project Kuiper\u2019s mission operations center in Redmond, Washington.",
      "Each satellite underwent a series of automated steps to activate onboard systems and began using electric propulsion to ascend to its final orbital altitude of 392 miles. Traveling at speeds exceeding 17,000 miles per hour, these satellites now circle Earth approximately every 90 minutes.",
      "The ultimate goal of KA-01 was not just deployment but to establish end-to-end network connectivity. This involves transmitting data through ground stations to satellites and back to customer antennas, a process that will enable high-speed internet service across even the most remote locations on Earth.",

While both systems share similarities, such as using low Earth orbit satellites for reduced latency, they differ in key aspects like satellite design, pricing and service goals.",
      "Starlink: With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage.",
      "Project Kuiper: Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper\u2019s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",

      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

      "Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (MIT Lincoln Laboratory) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",

      "ELECTRIC SUV IS THE ULTIMATE LIFELINE FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSIONS",
      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed. In addition to cameras, SPROUT can carry other sensors to image, map and even assess hazards within the collapsed structure.",

      "SPROUT has already been put through its paces at the Massachusetts Task Force 1 training site, where it demonstrated its ability to flex around corners and penetrate void spaces in engineered collapsed structures. These tests allowed the team to refine SPROUT\u2019s durability, portability and steering controls, with plans for larger field studies underway.",
      "The project is a true collaboration, pairing MIT\u2019s engineering expertise with Professor Margaret Coad\u2019s pioneering work on vine robots at Notre Dame.

      "KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan \u2014 There may only be a few days before the College of Cardinals gathers inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next leader of the Catholic Church, and, for the first time in history, an Asian pope is a real possibility.",
      "Of the 23 cardinals from Asia eligible to vote, one name comes up again and again, that of Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines, sometimes called the \"Philippine Francis.\"",
      "The 67-year-old had a close relationship with Pope Francis and served as his envoy to Asia during the 2015-16 special Jubilee Year, during which he made a brief stop in Taipei, Taiwan. Tagle also accompanied Francis on his first international trip to Asia in 2014, when the pontiff visited South Korea.",

      "Pope Francis achieved several \"firsts\" in Asia, including becoming the first pontiff to visit Myanmar in 2017 and Mongolia in 2023.\u00a0Thomas Tu, a Vatican diplomacy expert at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that while Mongolia is home to only about 1,400 Catholics, it now hosts a cardinal, but he is Italian-born and just 50 years old, making his election as pope unlikely.",
      "Another Asian candidate is Burma's Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, 76, from a country where Catholics represent just about 1% of the population. Meanwhile, over the last several days, reports from\u00a0South Korean newspapers\u00a0are suggesting South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, 74, is among the leading candidates to succeed Pope Francis.",
      "Pope Francis greets the people of China as he concludes Mass in the Hun Theatre Sept. 3, 2023, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Catholicism is growing rapidly in South Korea, according to Taipei-based Tu, who told Fox News Digital both Buddhists and Protestants have been converting at surprising rates.",
      "\"Unlike in Brazil, where Catholics are losing members to Evangelicals, Korea\u2019s Catholic Church is attracting new followers,\" Tu said. Then-Bishop Lazarus You Heung-sik is widely credited with helping persuade Pope Francis to make South Korea the first stop on his Asian travels in 2014. Heung-sik was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022.",

      "Francis may one day be rated as among the most influential popes of all time. Pope John Paul II made history by becoming the first pope from Poland and his pontificate lasted 26 years (1978-2006). Francis was head of the Catholic Church for a much shorter time, almost exactly 12 years, but the late pope appointed 80% of the cardinals who will vote for his successor.",
      "The late Holy Father also enlarged the number of cardinals and, for the first time in history, the upcoming conclave will see European cardinals in the minority. However, some experts warn against assuming the next pope will be \"Francis the Second,\" as many of these new cardinals are considered more conservative.",

      "The home nation of Asian cardinals doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the number of Catholics there. In Japan, Catholics make up fewer than 0.5% of the population, but there is a Japanese cardinal who is reasonably active on social media. The largest Asian block of cardinals hails from majority-Hindu India, which has six to the predominately Catholic Philippines\u2019 five.",
      "Still, many Vatican watchers believe Cardinal Tagle remains the most likely Asian candidate, although his progressive stances may prove divisive. Tagle has publicly criticized the church for using \"harsh words\" in past criticisms of LGBTQ Catholics and remarried divorcees and advocates for a more flexible approach. This stance is in line with Pope Francis\u2019 2015 papal declaration that said the church needs to \"avoid judgments which do not take into account the complexity of various situations.\"",

      "Should Tagle beat the odds and become the next pope, his election would energize the church\u2019s progressive wing, as he would likely continue the liberal-leaning direction charted by Francis. His emphasis on serving the poor has won him admiration across Asia and beyond, as has his relatable style. Tagle reportedly prefers being called by his nickname \"Chito,\" rather than by his formal title.",
      "Pope Francis officiating the General Audience in Saint Peter's square. Pope Francis together with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. (Photo by Grzegorz Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)",
      "Thomas Tu shared a personal story about Tagle\u2019s compassion, recalling an incident before the cardinal received his red hat. After a young seminarian died suddenly, Tagle chose to join the group of senior seminary members and personally visit the grieving family, later giving a moving sermon in which he \"compared the church to a mother, similar to the one who had lost her son,\" Tu said. \"Tagle just has a way of reaching people that is special.\"",
      "Few dispute that the election of the next pope will be among the most consequential moments for the Catholic Church in decades. And, for the first time, candidates from Asia are now part of serious conversations about the future direction of the faith.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The United Nations\u2019 UN80 Task Force is examining multiple suggested methods for reorganizing the institution, according to a leaked, confidential document shared with Fox News Digital. The six-page paper cites multiple inefficiencies and areas of improvement needed to combat \"geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budgets\" which are \"challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organization.\"",
      "The effort is \"eight and a half years late,\" Hugh Dugan,\u00a0former National Security Council Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs, told Fox News Digital: \"If [Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio] Guterres really comprehends that the system needs a major overhaul, he should step down and facilitate an early U.N. Secretary-General election.\" Dugan said that \"the person with the fresh mandate\" should overhaul the U.N.",

      "The UN80 Task Force document notes that \"overlapping mandates, inefficient use of resources, and inconsistent delivery of services\" are among the problems with proliferating agencies, funds and programs, and notes ways to integrate, consolidate, and coordinate among reformed entities to maximize the benefit for those who rely on the U.N.",
      "As another means of reducing outlays, the task force also recommended reducing the quantity of high-level posts, establishing single entities to coordinate Peace and Security, Humanitarian Affairs, and Human Rights, and \"reduc[ing] the number of U.N. development system entities.\"",
      "Dugan said the document \"looks more like a whiteboard stream of consciousness approach that you find on the first day of a business retreat.\" He said that it lacks mention of human resource improvements, finding ways of recruiting \"the very best in the world,\" or \"identifying performance measurements or metrics against the leaders of the organization, branches, [or] offices.\"",
      "Dugan said that the task force is also missing the important confidence-building measures needed to increase buy-in from members, to keep them \"impressed and enthusiastic\" about U.N. programs. \"They\u2019re assuming that they are the leaders that are the right people at the right time.\" Dugan said this is \"a real shortcoming.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is shown on the screen while speaking at the opening ceremony of the UN Internet Governance Forum - IGF 2021 at the International Congress Center in Katowice, Poland, on December 7th, 2021.\u00a0 (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto)",
      "\"I don\u2019t think they have the confidence of the world community or the talents or the resources to hold out another year and a half under this regime of Secretary Guterres,\" Dugan said. Rather than utilize the \"Noah\u2019s Ark management mentality\" of attempting to \"weather the storm,\" Dugan said that the U.N. must \"get very creative very quickly with what they have at hand.\"",
      "Dugan noted that the U.N. has gone through a \"fall-off in relevance\" with its lack of involvement in \"real world dynamics between member states.\" He urged the organization to identify \"the multilateral collateral, meaning we\u2019ve got to identify what\u2019s good, and then we have to get rid of what\u2019s damaged after eight years.\"",

      "In response to concerns shared by Dugan, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that the memo \"is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the Secretary-General\u2019s vision\" and is one \"of the three work streams that we are working on.\"",
      "Dujarric pointed to a speech Guterres delivered in March when introducing the UN80 Initiative, in which he called for an \"ambitious reform agenda to strengthen how we work and deliver.\" Guterres said this involves increasing transparency and accountability, being more effective and cutting costs, and decentralizing decisions to serve those who rely on the U.N.",

      "Dujarric also mentioned a speech Guterres gave eight years ago in September 2017, when he lamented the Byzantine bureaucracy that hampers progress at the U.N., and said that he was \"pursuing sweeping management reform \u2013 to simplify procedures and decentralize decisions, with greater transparency, efficiency and accountability.\"",
      "For Dugan, Guterres\u2019 failure to attempt those \"sweeping\" reforms prior to 2025 is an indication that regime change is needed. He reiterated that \"the Secretary-General\u2019s \u2018Trust me\u2019 window dressing is no longer convincing us to pay full retail.\"",

      "The families of the hostages are careful not to get overly involved in the heated political topics, but instead they have highlighted the importance of and need for a solid strategy to first secure the release of all remaining hostages, and then figure out a day-after plan.",
      "Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff has suggested that Hamas could become politically active in the Gaza Strip, but they need to fully disarm.",
      "\"I think the best approach will be just to call for both parties to rise above politics, although it will be very difficult with Hamas, which is politically struggling to survive in this region, but definitely to call on [the] Israeli government to rise above politics,\" Alexander said. \"Do not think about politically surviving and prioritize human life.\"",

      "\"Just to be clear, Hamas is the enemy,\" said Neutra, who sat next to her husband, Ronen. \"Hamas committed these atrocious crimes. They're holding on to our family members. We don't want to see them continue to be a threat to Israel.",

      "Neuer argued that the U.S. should act using a similar principle to the one used in cases against anti-Israel agitators, such as Mahmoud Khalil. He also wrote that \"Albanese\u2019s abuse of a global platform to spread hatred and legitimize terrorism demands an unequivocal response.\"",
      "\"Legally, it's very clear to me \u2014 I used to be an attorney in Manhattan for one of the major law firms in the United States \u2014 it's clear to be in any proper court of law this kind of procedural malpractice fraud would result in her not being a U.N. appointee,\" Neuer told Fox News Digital.",

      "When asked about U.N. Watch\u2019s letter, Pascal Sim, Spokesperson, UN Human Rights Council, told Fox News Digital that, \"Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (a country mandate), was appointed by the Human Rights Council on 1 April 2022, which was the last day of the 49th session of the Human Rights Council. She took up her function on 1 May 2022. Therefore, according to the \"no longer than six years\" principle, she can serve as Special Rapporteur until 30 April 2028.\"",
      "Sim also asserted that \"at no time has the Human Rights Council, in any formal or informal way, been called to 'reappoint' or 'renew' any Special Procedures mandate-holder. Whenever the Human Rights Council nominates any Special Procedures mandate-holder, it does so with the knowledge that the mandate-holder may serve up to six years in this function.\"",

      "Earlier this month, when the U.N. was set to consider Albanese\u2019s reappointment, House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Chair Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., urged the U.N. not to allow it to go through.",
      "Mast argued in a letter to U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) President Ju\u0308rg Lauber that Albanese \"unapologetically\" used her role in the international body to \"attempt to legitimize antisemitic tropes, while serving as a Hamas apologist.\"",

      "Additionally, in response to Fox News Digitial's request for comment, the State Department pointed to its April 15 statement regarding Albanese.",
      "\"The United States continues to strongly denounce Francesca Albanese\u2019s tenure as the 'UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967.' The Human Rights Council\u2019s (HRC) support for Ms. Albanese offers yet another example of why President Trump ordered the United States to cease all participation in the HRC. Ms. Albanese\u2019s actions also make clear the United Nations tolerates antisemitic hatred, bias against Israel and the legitimization of terrorism.\"",
      "In the past, multiple countries, including the U.S., have condemned Albanese for her remarks. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has compiled a list of antisemitic and anti-Israel statements made by Albanese throughout the years.",
      "In October 2024, while serving as a U.N. appointee, she shared a post on X, calling it a \"must-read for the ages.\" In the post, journalist Chris Hedges asserted that the \"Israel lobby has bought and paid for Congress and the two ruling parties,\" making campaign donations by Zionists \"a formidable barrier to peace.\"",
      "Albanese also compared Israel\u2019s war in Gaza to the Holocaust and, in August 2024, called the Gaza Strip a \"concentration camp of the 21st century.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/white-house-influencer-briefings-conspiracy-theorists-rcna204437",
    "published": "Sat, 03 May 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Attendees at the first three White House \"influencer briefings\" show an overwhelming right-leaning guest list.",
    "story": [
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried something new on Monday.",
      "Instead of just addressing credentialed journalists in the storied White House briefing room, she held a separate \u201cinfluencer briefing\u201d for 10 people.",
      "\u201cTens of millions of Americans are now turning to social media and independent media outlets to consume their news, and we are embracing that change, not ignoring it,\u201d she said during her seven-minute introductory remarks. \u201cAll journalists, outlets and voices have a seat at the table now, and you being here today for this briefing proves that.\u201d",
      "But as the new briefings continued through the week, it became clear that a very specific group was being given the special access.",
      "Of the 25 influencers identified by NBC News who attended the briefings, all but one have a history of explicit support for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, and some had direct connections to Trump \u2014 through either previously working in his administration, or maintaining a personal connection with his family or members of his Cabinet.",
      "\u201cWhere\u2019s the list [of] conservative leaning voices the Biden administration invited to the White House for similar engagements? The fact of the matter is, the legacy media is furious that information flow is not exclusive to them anymore,\u201d Kaelan Dorr, the White House deputy communications director, said in a statement. \u201cWe will ALWAYS find ways to meet people where they are, no hit piece will dissuade us.\u201d",
      "Indeed, the Trump White House isn\u2019t the first or only to engage with influencers. Joe Biden did so as president as well, at one point inviting more than 100 content creators to discuss a range of issues.",
      "But the current administration has more explicitly embraced pro-Trump media, pushing aside some traditional media outlets to exert more control over who gets access to the president.",
      "\u201cThe legacy media has had access to all open press events for decades, now new media gets access too,\u201d a White House official added, noting that the influencer briefings were also livestreamed.",
      "Trump\u2019s tribe",
      "In the first briefing, former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, who has nearly 1 million followers across various platforms, was welcomed as one of the influencers. After complimenting Trump for his \u201ccommitment to transparency,\u201d Spicer asked questions about Trump\u2019s legislative priorities and why Trump continues to sit for interviews with mainstream outlets and publications.",
      "In the second briefing on Tuesday, two of the eight influencers welcomed had clear ties to Trump\u2019s current and former administration. Link Lauren, who has over 1 million followers on TikTok and Instagram, served as a senior adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during his presidential campaign. In the briefing, Lauren threw a softball, asking Leavitt what advice she has for young working parents like herself.",
      "In the same briefing, former Treasury Department official William Upton appeared in his new role as political editor at the conservative publication The National Pulse, asking a question about the status of the Trump administration\u2019s rare earth minerals deal with Ukraine.",
      "In the third briefing, on Wednesday, one of the nine influencers present was 18-year-old Bo Loudon. The son of Trump surrogate Gina Loudon and former Republican Missouri state Sen. John Loudon, Bo Loudon has called himself Barron Trump\u2019s \u201cbest friend\u201d and appeared in numerous photos with both Barron Trump and the president. Loudon praised Leavitt during the influencer confab, calling her \u201can inspiration to Gen Z,\u201d before asking what her \u201cbiggest highlight\u201d was \u201cduring these first 100 historic days.\u201d",
      "Also present were Newsmax host David J. Harris, who was recognized by Trump at a Black History Month reception in February for being by his side \u201cfrom Day 1,\u201d and former Fox News host Eric Bolling, who authored the book \u201cThe Swamp: Washington\u2019s Murky Pool of Corruption and Cronyism and How Trump Can Drain It\u201d after he departed Fox News following allegations that he sent lewd photographs to three female colleagues. Bolling has denied the allegations.",
      "Jack Posobiec, a longtime Trump supporter who has promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, also attended Wednesday\u2019s briefing. He has reportedly been invited on and attended trips with members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, according to a post Posobiec made himself and a report by The Washington Post.",
      "Fringe meme-makers",
      "Alongside the well-connected crowd was a slew of other right-wing influencers and personalities.",
      "On Monday, influencers Grant Godwin and Rogan O\u2019Handley, who run the highly followed conservative meme accounts @the_typical_liberal and @DC_Draino, asked about the Jeffrey Epstein files and a campaign to implement laws that would allow concealed gun carrying in all 50 states.",
      "On Tuesday, Brenden Dilley, known for leading a pro-Trump meme team that created a controversial video shared by Trump in May 2024 that mentioned the \u201ccreation of a unified Reich,\u201d played a game of \u201cTruth or Trolling\u201d with Leavitt.",
      "On Wednesday, Dom Lucre, a highly followed conspiracy theorist on X who was briefly banned from the platform after he shared child sexual abuse material, asked Leavitt about the possibility of an investigation into Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton over election integrity. Leavitt welcomed the question and called it \u201crefreshing.\u201d",
      "\u2018Opposite of authentic\u2019",
      "Jackson Gosnell, who appears semiregularly on right-leaning One America News, appeared at Monday\u2019s briefing. On TikTok, he\u2019s built a following of over 150,000 followers through videos where he shares news in a more traditional newscasting style. In a phone interview, he said he was surprised at how favorable some of the other influencers were to the Trump administration in the briefings.",
      "\u201cSome people were very complimentary to the administration. I sort of took the approach of asking a question instead of, you know, more so giving a praise speech,\u201d he said.",
      "Gosnell, who asked a question about the current status of talks between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia, said his invite came after he submitted an application via an online form shared by Leavitt on X. He said the White House reached out to him just a few days before the briefing and asked if he wanted to attend a special event with the press secretary.",
      "Gosnell said questions were not screened before the press conference and, at least in his experience, it was a very hands-off interaction; he said he was at the White House only for the duration of the press conference, and he didn\u2019t receive guidance before or after on what should or shouldn\u2019t be posted.",
      "The influencer briefings have received a largely critical response online. Many on the left have criticized them for featuring creators with a right-wing tilt and individuals who have a history of sharing controversial content. And on the right, influential figures like Laura Loomer have criticized them for leaving out hardcore MAGA influencers like herself.",
      "One influential right-wing publicist, who asked not to be named to protect his clients, said he\u2019s recommended that influencers he works with not attend the briefings.",
      "\u201cThe entire reason the public turned to these influencers is because they wanted authenticity and the truth. These briefings are the opposite of authentic,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cYou can\u2019t market yourself as edgy or a truth-teller when you\u2019re sucking up to power in the most elite building on earth. These briefings will backfire on the influencers and podcasters attending them.",
      "CORRECTION (May 3, 2025, 10:19 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized Bolling\u2019s exit from Fox News. At the time, a Fox News spokesperson said they parted ways \u201camicably,\u201d not that he was fired."

      "\u201cIf you\u2019re with the right people, and you\u2019re enjoying the time and the atmosphere, the rain doesn\u2019t matter at all,\u201d said Tom Flynn, 48, who was attending his 15th Derby on Saturday.",
      "The hours leading up the race were still action packed.",
      "Dignitaries ranging from retired NFL players to influencers to Kentucky governor Andy Beshear walked the red carpet. Serious bettors and the people who heard a tip from a friend alike were heavily invested in the day\u2019s earlier races, watching intently on TVs above the wager window and cheering or groaning as horses made their way down the homestretch. All the while, countless people walked by often holding one (and nearly as often two) of the race\u2019s signature drinks, the mint julep and the lily.",
      "And the outfits somehow managed to maintain their essence amid the rain, safely tucked away under large, clear ponchos so as not to be fully muted.",
      "To see the suits and dresses of the Derby is to be frozen in a specific time and place. No matter what fashion trend may be taking over the outside world, inside the gates of Churchill Downs you will always see colorful suits with crisp, single-pleated, slim-fit pants, floral dresses and elaborate headwear, with hats tilted to just the perfect angle.",
      "\u201cI started planning my outfit four months ago,\u201d Kimberly Booth, 54, said. She started with her headwear first, finding a hat maker she liked on Etsy, then finding matching dresses from there.",
      "Booth was attending her first Derby. After years of playing the lottery for tickets, she finally received one from a friend. Traveling all the way from Louisiana, the party exceeded her expectations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s even more [exciting] than I thought,\u201d Booth said. \u201cEspecially because, being from just outside New Orleans we do Mardi Gras every single year, this is just spectacular. I love it.\u201d",
      "As for the actual race, the rain doesn\u2019t necessarily level the playing field, with the conventional wisdom being a good horse is a good horse. That doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t be looking for an edge, though.",
      "\u201cIs it Sovereign? Oh, Sovereignty,\u201d said Johnnie Rominger, a 48-year-old from West Virginia when asked who he would bet on for Derby. \u201cIt was a tip from a girl I know that knows horses. She said put money on him. I\u2019ll try.\u201d",
      "Attending his second Derby, Rominger kept it simple when asked what he\u2019s most excited about.",

      "At 8:26 on the morning of Wednesday, January 8, a silver 53-foot, 18-wheeled horse transport van rolled up alongside Barn 59 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, seven miles due west of Pasadena and about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains.",
      "Workers efficiently loaded 15 horses in the care of thoroughbred trainer Michael McCarthy up a short ramp and into small travel stalls on the van. The process took just 25 minutes. At 8:51, driver Ysidro Cruz \u2014 everybody calls him Sid \u2014 slowly negotiated the hulking van off the backstretch to Baldwin Ave. and toward his final destination at the San Luis Rey Downs thoroughbred training center just north of San Diego. McCarthy also has stalls there, although unlike at Santa Anita, no parimutuel races are contested.",
      "Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby",
      "Cruz took the I-210 Freeway west to the I-15 Freeway south before exiting on Route 76, a few miles from the end. The 107-mile trip took two hours and seven minutes, pretty good time in L.A. traffic on a weekday morning. (Kerrie Sahadi, the third-generation horse transport owner whose company, KC Horse Transport, moved McCarthy\u2019s horses, provided the exact travel times from her GPS tracking database.) The horses were offloaded into McCarthy\u2019s barn at San Luis Rey, and bedded down. \u201cNothing remarkable about the trip...,\u201d Sahadi told me.",
      "And that is true. There was nothing remarkable\u00a0about the trip. It was what horses do every day in America and around the world: They get on vans and they travel from place to place for an array of functional reasons. To race, to rest, to retire. It is manifestly ordinary. But the rest of that morning in Southern California, and the days and weeks that followed, were not ordinary; they were apocalyptic.",
      "In the evening before McCarthy\u2019s (and others\u2019) horses moved, a wildfire had started in the steep hills above and to the west of Santa Anita; eight hours earlier, a larger fire had exploded in Pacific Palisades, dominating cable news coverage and stretching emergency resources. By late night, the second fire was encroaching on residential areas and was ominously visible from the racetrack. Fed by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, it would become the Eaton Fire (for Eaton Canyon, where it started), the second-most destructive wildfire in California history, wiping out more than 9,000 structures, most in Altadena, and upending daily life for what is likely to be years. It would kill 18 people before containment.",
      "Many track employees stayed overnight on the grounds, not only to help oversee emergency operations but because many of their own homes were endangered. McCarthy\u2019s family had left their Altadena home in the fire\u2019s path and moved into a hotel, but McCarthy slept only fitfully and got up at 4 a.m. to check on his house before going to work. By early morning, as the van was loaded, the winds had ebbed slightly, but remained fierce. \u201cA crazy wind,\u201d says Sahadi. \u201cAnd there were embers flying around.\u201d There was a justifiable sense of uncertainty, and down some neural pathways from there, fear.",
      "Among the total of 17 horses (two on another van) that McCarthy sent away was a handsome and well-balanced three-year-old bay colt named Journalism. He had raced three times before the fire \u2014 losing a maiden six-furlong race that was too short for his long stride and big body, breaking his maiden at a mile on Nov. 17, and then just 27 days later, winning the 1 1/16-mile Los Alamos Futurity by a widening and dominant 3 1/2 lengths. It is a weary narrative tool to explain a successful racehorse\u2019s story as a \u201cjourney.\u201d Where he was born (and who were his parents), where he was sold and then taught to run, where he landed in the sprawling ecosystem of the sport, and under whose ownership and in what trainer\u2019s hands. We do this in large part because horses cannot tell their own stories.",
      "Today, Journalism is the favorite to win Saturday\u2019s 151st\u00a0Kentucky Derby, to the extent that any horse can be favored to win a 20-horse rodeo witnessed by more than 150,000 raucous partygoers at a distance of 1 1/4 miles, which none of them have run previously and most will never run again. The longer view: Journalism was moved from his home in the midst of a natural disaster, and then returned, just as tens of thousands of Californians hope to do. As North Carolinians and Floridians are still doing from hurricanes and their side effects. Journalism has plowed through disruption, as millions of Americans attempt to do every day in these disquieting times of ours. His name is symbolic of that disruption, a once-trusted institution, splintered.",
      "His\u00a0journey is our journey.",
      "On a mid-April morning, I drove my rental car north out of downtown Pasadena on Lake Ave., across the border into Altadena and up into the hillside streets most damaged by the Eaton Fire. It is part of small-j journalism to observe the detritus of tragedy where possible and to not accept others\u2019 descriptions of painful landscapes. It can be unpleasant work, tinged with guilt from voyeuristically co-opting pain. In January of 2007, I rode with New Orleans Saints\u2019 quarterback Drew Brees through the city\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward, which had been disproportionately punished by Hurricane Katrina. Six years later, in May of 2013, I spent a week in Moore, Oklahoma, with members of a high school football team after an F5 tornado leveled many of their neighborhoods. It\u2019s not possible to experience what took place, but it\u2019s important to see it.",
      "So it is in Altadena today. Many streets are, as Michael McCarthy said to me, \u201cjust chimneys.\u201d Chimneys and foundations. And melted cars. The destruction goes on until blocks turn into miles, each empty parcel representing a family or some other collection of humans. Inexplicably, the carnage is intermittently paused by a home that was seemingly untouched, as if the fire hiccupped. Work crews are everywhere, and will be for a very long time. Amid the rubble, trees have blossomed in vibrant shades of green, insisting. From the grandstand at Santa Anita, mountains stretch horizontally across the field of vision; the areas toward Altadena and Sierra Madre, recently brown and black, are now dotted with green spots. That is vegetation, not residences. But life.",
      "McCarthy\u2019s home survived, although many nearby did not. It will be at least late summer before McCarthy, 54, and his wife and teenaged daughter, can return. And of course, even then, it won\u2019t be the same. It won\u2019t ever be the same. McCarthy was raised in Altadena, and after more than a decade living the successful but itinerant life of a trainer, he came back and started his own operation in 2014. As we stood outside his barn and talked, and then walked to the track and talked some more, he pointed in one direction and then another, and another. \u201cMy parents live across the street over there,\u201d he said. \u201cMy in-laws\u2019 house backs up to the turf course. We\u2019re over there on the hill.\u201d He could hear race calls from his childhood yard.",
      "His middle school friends were the sons and daughters of horse trainers, so there he went, from mucking stalls and hot walking, on up the ladder until he was a trusted assistant for Hall of Famer and two-time Derby winner Todd Pletcher. His life unfolds in the 24/7/365 rhythm of the racetrack, and now there is more with the aftermath of the fire. He is thankful that his home survived, but that brings challenges of its own, with severe smoke damage.

McCarthy was raised in Altadena, and after more than a decade living the successful but itinerant life of a trainer, he came back and started his own operation in 2014. As we stood outside his barn and talked, and then walked to the track and talked some more, he pointed in one direction and then another, and another. \u201cMy parents live across the street over there,\u201d he said. \u201cMy in-laws\u2019 house backs up to the turf course.

      "Now we\u2019re standing in Journalism\u2019s stall No. 40, McCarthy near the colt\u2019s nose, which is pressed against the wooden barrier at the back of the stall; and me, closer to the other end. Journalism stands 16 hands and nearly two inches tall at the base of his neck, where such measurements are taken. He is a big horse, an inch shorter than Secretariat (just for reference, calm down), but big does not always mean fast, and almost never means nimble. (But Journalism is verifiably fast and has shown he can recover from trouble, if not avoid it altogether.) Straw is gathered around Journalism\u2019s feet like a blanket, nearly a foot deep. McCarthy, smitten, ticks off meaningful qualities. \u201cBig powerful neck, sloping shoulder, thickness around the cannon bone, like a runner with big quads.\u201d As McCarthy talks, Journalism shifts his right eye in our direction for reasons entirely unknown.",

      "Uncertainty over the economy due to President Donald Trump\u2019s oscillating tariff policies looms large over America\u2019s longest running sporting event and the most exciting two minutes in sports \u2014\u00a0the Kentucky Derby.",
      "The track itself has put some projects on hold.",
      "Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby",
      "\u201cUncertainty is a theme out there in the American economy, and that\u2019s one we pay attention to,\u201d said Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs. \u201cSo we did pause our $900 million construction project primarily, and mostly because we weren\u2019t sure what things were going to cost. And whenever you build something, you\u2019ve got to be very careful on the cost side.\u201d",
      "Churchill Downs announced last week it was pausing a major renovation project it had announced in February due to the uncertainty in the economy and Trump\u2019s tariffs. The racetrack had planned to debut these renovations during the next year\u2019s racing season, including more than 20,000 new seats, 36 luxury suites and upgrades to the infrastructure. But the higher price of steel \u2014 crucial to construction \u2014 and supply chain interruptions, created a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d for Churchill Downs.",
      "Carstanjen said the tariffs and current economic environment created \u201cunanticipated and currently unquantifiable expected cost increases in materials.\u201d",
      "While the 151st Kentucky Derby is on track to meet its normal attendance, Carstanjen did see some hesitance in sales this year, particularly in the lower-tier tickets. In addition to ticket sales, Carstanjen said Churchill Downs is seeing overall \u201csoftness\u201d in some areas of betting, including a slip in sports wagering to the tune of more than $1 million.\u00a0He blamed faltering consumer confidence.",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat in a largely Republican state, called Trump\u2019s tariffs an \u201cattack on American people\u201d and noted that both Republican senators from his state have also criticized the president\u2019s economic strategy.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s current tariff plan is causing chaos in our economy,\u201d he said at a press conference Thursday. \u201cIt is slowing our economic growth. It\u2019s hitting large businesses, with UPS announcing a lot of layoffs. It\u2019s hitting small and medium-sized businesses.\u201d",
      "Many Derby goers were cognizant of Churchill Downs\u2019 announcement, especially those who were impressed by this year\u2019s renovations.\u00a0Ed Massey of New Jersey has been coming to the Derby for decades.",
      "\u201cTariffs are not going to get in the way of the 151-year Derby spirit,\u201d he told NBC News.\u00a0\u201cBut I do worry about the future growth of the event. The Derby will outlast any tariffs, but will it be able to grow? That remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "Horse racing and betting aren\u2019t the only two Kentucky staples that are taking a hit from the tariffs. Economic experts in the state say they\u2019ve already seen an impact on agriculture, energy, manufacturing and bourbon \u2014 which has a $9 billion impact in Kentucky.",
      "\u201cA billion-dollar investment is more than just what it means for the track \u2014 that will have a ripple effect on the economy in the region,\u201d said Kate Shanks, vice president of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to purchase lumber. You\u2019ve got to purchase glass, steel, hire electricians, HVAC workers, and we were eager to see that happen. And now that\u2019s been paused, and it\u2019s absolutely going to have an impact on jobs in the region.\u201d",
      "According to the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the state has approximately 480,000 jobs that depend on trade. The chamber estimated these tariffs will cost the average Kentuckian up to $1,200 per year."

    "story": [
      "From a drama standpoint, the 151st Kentucky Derby has a tough act to follow after last year\u2019s three-way photo finish. But Saturday\u2019s edition features an intriguing handicapping puzzle, with the possibility of a wild result and a nice payday for those who can figure it out.",
      "I\u2019d love to be one of them, and while my track record makes me something far less than an authority on these matters, here are a few angles that I\u2019m looking at.",
      "The favorite",
      "His name is Journalism and he towers above the field in at least one notable metric: speed figures. For every race that\u2019s run across the country, each horse is assigned a Beyer speed rating, based on an algorithm designed to flatten out variances between different race lengths and track conditions. The higher the number, the better the horse.",
      "Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby",
      "In one of the two key Kentucky Derby prep races he won in Southern California, Journalism posted a Beyer of 108, tops of anyone in this field. Having the best Beyer doesn\u2019t automatically translate to victory, but notably in last year\u2019s running, the top four finishers were all horses who came in with among the five highest Beyers in the field.",
      "The knock on Journalism? He put up those numbers against tiny fields \u2014 just four rivals in each of those races. In the Kentucky Derby he\u2019ll be facing 19 foes and vastly more traffic than he\u2019s ever had to contend with.",

      "New to betting horse racing? Here's our tips ahead of the Kentucky Derby",
      "LeBron James doesn't want to answer questions about his future after Lakers' playoff exit",
      "Heating up too much?",
      "On paper, there\u2019s tons of early speed in this year\u2019s Kentucky Derby \u2014 horses that want (or need) to be on the lead or just off of it to run their best. The problem with lots of speed is that these horses tend to push each other to go too fast, too soon, burning them all out and opening the door for a fresh-legged rival to mow them down in the stretch.",
      "Four of the five inside horses in this year\u2019s race have the potential to flash early speed (Citizen Bull, Neoequos, American Promise and Admire Daytona). So do East Avenue and Owen Almighty, who will start farther out. That\u2019s the recipe for a pace meltdown, and maybe even for someone to come from the clouds to win at a big price. Sandman and Sovereignty are the most highly touted deep closers in the field; Tiztastic, Burnham Square and Chunk of Gold will also be coming from far back and would all blow up the tote board.",
      "Follow the latest sports coverage from\u00a0NBC News and NBC Sports. Stream the Kentucky Derby\u00a0live on Peacock.",
      "Bob Baffert\u2019s back",
      "The best-known trainer in horse racing, 72-year-old Bob Baffert, is making his return to Churchill Downs after a three-year ban. Officially, Baffert has won the race six times (a seventh winner, Medina Spirit, was later disqualified after the discovery of a medication violation, which triggered his suspension) and has the backing of some of the sport\u2019s most ambitious and deep-pocketed owners. He typically boasts the deepest roster of Kentucky Derby prospects, though this year\u2019s crop has underwhelmed a bit \u2014 at least so far.",
      "Baffert\u2019s entry, Citizen Bull, might end up a decent price. He likes to be in front and could therefore be compromised if that hot pace develops. (Note: Baffert\u2019s other entry, Rodriguez, was scratched late Thursday. He is also a speed horse, so his exit could boost Citizen Bull.)",
      "Citizen Bull has the added challenge of drawing the dreaded No. 1 post, jammed inside by the rail. The last horse to win from that spot was Ferdinand back in 1986. But dismiss Baffert\u2019s duo at your own peril. Better than anyone, he knows how to win this race, even when the pace scenario looks unfavorable \u2014 something he once did at odds of 21-1 with War Emblem back in 2002.",
      "The also eligible",
      "With Rodriguez scratching from the race, Baeza will now join the field from the far outside post. Don\u2019t let his late entry fool you: This horse is a major contender.",
      "He ran against favorite Journalism in the Santa Anita Derby and put up a whale of a fight, losing by less than a length and posting an impressive 100 speed rating. Like Journalism, he figures to sit off the pace and potentially be in position to capitalize if the horses up front burn out.",
      "The Japan factor",
      "Japan is a relative newcomer to the international racing scene, and for a while, simply getting a horse into the Kentucky Derby field was considered a feat. But in the last few years, the Japanese program has blossomed, with Japan-based horses taking down major races in the Middle East and here in the U.S.",
      "Last year, Forever Young came within inches of becoming the first Japanese horse to win the Kentucky Derby, losing out in a three-way photo finish for the ages. This year, there are two Japanese runners, Admire Daytona and Luxor Cafe, who has bested Admire Daytona twice and seems the stronger of the two. But no one quite knows what to make of Luxor Cafe, who has done all of his racing in Japan, never facing any American horses. Video from his wins looks very impressive, but just how good were the horses he was beating? And will that form translate to the U.S.?",
      "The best storyline",
      "Lonnie Briley was never supposed to be here. The folksy 72-year-old Louisianan has been training horses since 1991 and has had success, but mostly with cheap horses running for small prizes in racing\u2019s backwaters. Until now.",
      "His horse, Coal Battle, may lack the regal breeding of his foes in this race, but that only makes what he\u2019s achieved that much more impressive: an improbable four-race win streak over the fall and winter, from a small stakes at lowly Delta Downs to a triumph in the Grade 2 Rebel Stakes at venerable Oaklawn Park and a berth in the Kentucky Derby. It\u2019s made him \u2014 by far \u2014 the most accomplished horse Briley has ever conditioned.",
      "Almost 15% of all of the purse money Briley\u2019s horses have ever won, in fact, is from Coal Battle over the past few months. Before this, Briley had never come remotely close to the Kentucky Derby, and just by getting here he\u2019s defied the odds. Coal Battle\u2019s odds are long in this race (his speed figures are on the light side), but even his rival trainers will probably be smiling if he can pull this one off.",
      "My pick (or as I call it, my annual Kiss of Death)",
      "I\u2019m still torn as I type this. But I\u2019ll be sharing it along with the rest of the NBC Sports team around 6:30 p.m. Saturday."

    "story": [
      "At 8:26 on the morning of Wednesday, January 8, a silver 53-foot, 18-wheeled horse transport van rolled up alongside Barn 59 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, seven miles due west of Pasadena and about 20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains.",
      "Workers efficiently loaded 15 horses in the care of thoroughbred trainer Michael McCarthy up a short ramp and into small travel stalls on the van. The process took just 25 minutes. At 8:51, driver Ysidro Cruz \u2014 everybody calls him Sid \u2014 slowly negotiated the hulking van off the backstretch to Baldwin Ave. and toward his final destination at the San Luis Rey Downs thoroughbred training center just north of San Diego. McCarthy also has stalls there, although unlike at Santa Anita, no parimutuel races are contested.",
      "Follow along for live coverage of the Kentucky Derby",
      "Cruz took the I-210 Freeway west to the I-15 Freeway south before exiting on Route 76, a few miles from the end. The 107-mile trip took two hours and seven minutes, pretty good time in L.A. traffic on a weekday morning. (Kerrie Sahadi, the third-generation horse transport owner whose company, KC Horse Transport, moved McCarthy\u2019s horses, provided the exact travel times from her GPS tracking database.) The horses were offloaded into McCarthy\u2019s barn at San Luis Rey, and bedded down. \u201cNothing remarkable about the trip...,\u201d Sahadi told me.",
      "And that is true. There was nothing remarkable\u00a0about the trip. It was what horses do every day in America and around the world: They get on vans and they travel from place to place for an array of functional reasons. To race, to rest, to retire. It is manifestly ordinary. But the rest of that morning in Southern California, and the days and weeks that followed, were not ordinary; they were apocalyptic.",
      "In the evening before McCarthy\u2019s (and others\u2019) horses moved, a wildfire had started in the steep hills above and to the west of Santa Anita; eight hours earlier, a larger fire had exploded in Pacific Palisades, dominating cable news coverage and stretching emergency resources. By late night, the second fire was encroaching on residential areas and was ominously visible from the racetrack. Fed by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, it would become the Eaton Fire (for Eaton Canyon, where it started), the second-most destructive wildfire in California history, wiping out more than 9,000 structures, most in Altadena, and upending daily life for what is likely to be years. It would kill 18 people before containment.",
      "Many track employees stayed overnight on the grounds, not only to help oversee emergency operations but because many of their own homes were endangered. McCarthy\u2019s family had left their Altadena home in the fire\u2019s path and moved into a hotel, but McCarthy slept only fitfully and got up at 4 a.m. to check on his house before going to work. By early morning, as the van was loaded, the winds had ebbed slightly, but remained fierce. \u201cA crazy wind,\u201d says Sahadi. \u201cAnd there were embers flying around.\u201d There was a justifiable sense of uncertainty, and down some neural pathways from there, fear.",
      "Among the total of 17 horses (two on another van) that McCarthy sent away was a handsome and well-balanced three-year-old bay colt named Journalism. He had raced three times before the fire \u2014 losing a maiden six-furlong race that was too short for his long stride and big body, breaking his maiden at a mile on Nov. 17, and then just 27 days later, winning the 1 1/16-mile Los Alamos Futurity by a widening and dominant 3 1/2 lengths. It is a weary narrative tool to explain a successful racehorse\u2019s story as a \u201cjourney.\u201d Where he was born (and who were his parents), where he was sold and then taught to run, where he landed in the sprawling ecosystem of the sport, and under whose ownership and in what trainer\u2019s hands. We do this in large part because horses cannot tell their own stories.",
      "Today, Journalism is the favorite to win Saturday\u2019s 151st\u00a0Kentucky Derby, to the extent that any horse can be favored to win a 20-horse rodeo witnessed by more than 150,000 raucous partygoers at a distance of 1 1/4 miles, which none of them have run previously and most will never run again. The longer view: Journalism was moved from his home in the midst of a natural disaster, and then returned, just as tens of thousands of Californians hope to do. As North Carolinians and Floridians are still doing from hurricanes and their side effects. Journalism has plowed through disruption, as millions of Americans attempt to do every day in these disquieting times of ours. His name is symbolic of that disruption, a once-trusted institution, splintered.",
      "His\u00a0journey is our journey.",
      "On a mid-April morning, I drove my rental car north out of downtown Pasadena on Lake Ave., across the border into Altadena and up into the hillside streets most damaged by the Eaton Fire. It is part of small-j journalism to observe the detritus of tragedy where possible and to not accept others\u2019 descriptions of painful landscapes. It can be unpleasant work, tinged with guilt from voyeuristically co-opting pain. In January of 2007, I rode with New Orleans Saints\u2019 quarterback Drew Brees through the city\u2019s Lower Ninth Ward, which had been disproportionately punished by Hurricane Katrina. Six years later, in May of 2013, I spent a week in Moore, Oklahoma, with members of a high school football team after an F5 tornado leveled many of their neighborhoods. It\u2019s not possible to experience what took place, but it\u2019s important to see it.",
      "So it is in Altadena today. Many streets are, as Michael McCarthy said to me, \u201cjust chimneys.\u201d Chimneys and foundations. And melted cars. The destruction goes on until blocks turn into miles, each empty parcel representing a family or some other collection of humans. Inexplicably, the carnage is intermittently paused by a home that was seemingly untouched, as if the fire hiccupped. Work crews are everywhere, and will be for a very long time. Amid the rubble, trees have blossomed in vibrant shades of green, insisting. From the grandstand at Santa Anita, mountains stretch horizontally across the field of vision; the areas toward Altadena and Sierra Madre, recently brown and black, are now dotted with green spots. That is vegetation, not residences. But life.",
      "McCarthy\u2019s home survived, although many nearby did not. It will be at least late summer before McCarthy, 54, and his wife and teenaged daughter, can return. And of course, even then, it won\u2019t be the same. It won\u2019t ever be the same. McCarthy was raised in Altadena, and after more than a decade living the successful but itinerant life of a trainer, he came back and started his own operation in 2014. As we stood outside his barn and talked, and then walked to the track and talked some more, he pointed in one direction and then another, and another. \u201cMy parents live across the street over there,\u201d he said. \u201cMy in-laws\u2019 house backs up to the turf course. We\u2019re over there on the hill.\u201d He could hear race calls from his childhood yard.",
      "His middle school friends were the sons and daughters of horse trainers, so there he went, from mucking stalls and hot walking, on up the ladder until he was a trusted assistant for Hall of Famer and two-time Derby winner Todd Pletcher. His life unfolds in the 24/7/365 rhythm of the racetrack, and now there is more with the aftermath of the fire. He is thankful that his home survived, but that brings challenges of its own, with severe smoke damage. He struggles with the contrary emotion that those who lost their homes entirely can find a fresher start. But he is also self-aware. When I characterize his situation as \u201cPain,\u201d he corrects me: \u201cNot pain, inconvenience.\u201d These are degrees of massive upheaval; it will take time to work through it all.",
      "To the morning of Jan. 8: McCarthy remembers winds, still howling. \u201cEighty or 90 miles an hour.\u201d His thoughts: \u201cThe horses were in their environment,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThey were in the corner of their stalls, which is where they go when they know something is going on. Journalism was in the back right corner, which is his place. I felt like this was the safest place for them.\u201d But? \u201cI did put some horses on a van, mostly horses that were sitting on a race, to make sure we didn\u2019t upset their routine.

      "It was a strange time. I asked McCarthy if he feared the fire might make it all the way across the freeway and onto the track. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cFrom those mountains to right here is two-and-a-half miles, plus a huge fire break with the 210 Freeway.\u201d Pause. \u201cBut things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it possible for a fire to get here? I don\u2019t want to find out. But we\u2019ve got wells, and sprinklers. But really, I don\u2019t want to find out.\u201d",
      "Journalism spent four days at San Luis Rey. It is another layer to this story that the eventual Kentucky Derby favorite was sent from one place upended by fire to another. On Dec. 7, 2017, the Lilac Fire in North San Diego County tore through San Luis Rey Downs and killed 46 horses, severely burned trainers Martine Bellocq and Joe Herrick and left many other deep scars.

      "Now we\u2019re standing in Journalism\u2019s stall No. 40, McCarthy near the colt\u2019s nose, which is pressed against the wooden barrier at the back of the stall; and me, closer to the other end. Journalism stands 16 hands and nearly two inches tall at the base of his neck, where such measurements are taken. He is a big horse, an inch shorter than Secretariat (just for reference, calm down), but big does not always mean fast, and almost never means nimble. (But Journalism is verifiably fast and has shown he can recover from trouble, if not avoid it altogether.) Straw is gathered around Journalism\u2019s feet like a blanket, nearly a foot deep. McCarthy, smitten, ticks off meaningful qualities. \u201cBig powerful neck, sloping shoulder, thickness around the cannon bone, like a runner with big quads.\u201d As McCarthy talks, Journalism shifts his right eye in our direction for reasons entirely unknown.",

    "story": [
      "In the week following President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost.",
      "Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II.",
      "Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump\u2019s tariff plan were testing traders\u2019 faith in the United States\u2019 ability to make timely payments on its debt.",
      "Stocks around the world sold off, too.",
      "\u201cApril was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,\u201d analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cThe initial moves were truly historic in their speed.\u201d",
      "With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts, Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for \u201cnon-retaliating\u201d countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized.",
      "Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off.",
      "The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker\u2019s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president\u2019s policies.\u00a0Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump,\u00a0is still 40% off its December peak.",
      "Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "And with Friday\u2019s close, the index saw its longest winning streak in 20 years.",
      "Experts say the\u00a0recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump\u2019s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an \u201cacceptance\u201d stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another.",
      "\u201cMarkets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, \u2018OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?\u2019\u201d said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. \u201cPeople are starting to look more forward than backward.\u201d",
      "If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, the recovery has been led by so-called \u201cretail\u201d investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing.",
      "According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), \u201cbulls,\u201d or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered \u201cbears\u201d (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month, the most in its 15-year history and the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported.",
      "\u201cIt would be simplistic to say it\u2019s just retail \u2014 but to a large extent it has been,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group.",
      "The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in \u201cmeme\u201d stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds.",
      "The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d \u2014 the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they\u2019ve gone down \u2014 remains, Sosnick said.",
      "\u201cI think the key element has been American investors\u2019 unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.\u201d",
      "The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump\u2019s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday, stocks surged on a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump\u2019s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute.",
      "And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despite a strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back. Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year.",
      "Friday\u2019s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing.",
      "Companies, too, are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing it as they await clarity on how Trump\u2019s tariffs shake out.",
      "As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whose regular survey most recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%.",
      "\u201cBearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,\u201d the AAII said. \u201cBearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.",
      "\u201cThose negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,\u201d he said.",
      "There are also signs that the \u201cSell America\u201d trade is lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, who noted in a post on X Friday that the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities.",
      "There\u2019s been a \u201crotation away from the U.S.\u201d even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said.",
      "In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Islam, of VettaFi. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of that uncertainty.\u201d"

    "summary": "In just two months on the job, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "In just two months on the job, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised the profile of autism more than any recent public official.",
      "Autism advocacy groups typically welcome more attention to their cause. But many autistic people say Kennedy is exploiting their community \u2014 and perpetuating harmful stereotypes \u2014 as part of his decadeslong campaign against vaccines, even as the Trump administration threatens to eliminate services that help people with autism reach their full potential.",
      "At an April press conference on autism rates among school-age kids, Kennedy described autism as an epidemic and a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are kids who will never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use the toilet unassisted,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "In response, 15 advocacy groups issued a joint statement calling for autistic people to be treated with respect and support. The groups said they are \u201cdeeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions\u201d that fail to \u201creflect the inherent value, rights and diverse needs of autistic people.\u201d",
      "Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, was one of many people to speak out. Gross and her brother have autism.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge for our parents, but our family wasn\u2019t destroyed,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Ari Ne\u2019eman, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he sees Kennedy\u2019s disparaging remarks as \u201cpart of the long and unfortunate history of fearmongering in the autism world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an unscrupulous industry of alternative medicine providers who exploit families by charging them tens of thousands of dollars to \u2018recover\u2019 people with autism,\u201d said Ne\u2019eman, who has autism. \u201cThe way that industry works is by terrifying families.\u201d",
      "Even among people with intellectual disabilities \u2014 a category that includes 40% of people with autism \u2014 1 in 5 held a paid job in the community in 2020.",
      "Kennedy later said he was referring to people with \u201cprofound autism,\u201d including those without access to speech.\u00a0Research suggests 10% to 27% of autistic people are nonverbal or have other significant needs, a rate that has remained relatively consistent since 2000.",
      "Philip Weintraub, 53, didn\u2019t speak a word until he was 5 years old.",
      "But he received speech therapy throughout elementary school. Occupational therapy improved his motor skills, which allowed him to play soccer and basketball in middle school and high school, as well as softball as an adult.",
      "After high school, he began volunteering for the Bill Clinton campaign and later worked for the White House. Weintraub now works at the Universal Services Administrative Company, which connects people to broadband services. When he returned to school to become certified in computer science, his school provided someone to take notes and gave him extra time on a test.",
      "He and his wife, Liz, who has cerebral palsy, live in the Washington, D.C., area. Weintraub noted that they have gone on many dates.",
      "\u201cWe are coming up on our 20th anniversary,\u201d he said.",
      "Many autistic people and their advocates say Kennedy\u2019s remarks on autism perpetuate stigmas about the disorder, a neurodevelopmental disability in which people experience difficulties with social interaction or communication and often have restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.",
      "Symptoms can vary dramatically from person to person, however, and some people with autism need higher levels of support than others.",
      "Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, said she welcomed Kennedy\u2019s focus on autistic people who need more intensive support. However, she objects to the suggestion that the lives of some autistic people have little worth.",
      "Kennedy \u201cmade it sound like these individuals\u2019 lives had no value if they couldn\u2019t pay taxes,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat they couldn\u2019t love and weren\u2019t worthy of love. My daughter has profound autism and so does my older brother. They both live lives of meaning and dignity.\u201d",
      "Although attitudes toward autism have changed significantly in recent decades, Kennedy doesn\u2019t seem to have kept up, said David Mandell, associate director of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s Center for Autism Research.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments about autism echo the language of some autism organizations from 20 years ago, when advocates often spoke of \u201ccuring\u201d the condition, Mandell said.",
      "In a written statement to NBC News, an HHS spokesperson said, \u201cSecretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports and the full respect and recognition they deserve. His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families. HHS supports ongoing collaboration and research to both identify the causes of autism and provide the best possible care and management strategies for those impacted.\u201d",
      "Where were the autistic people?",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are more than 5 million adults with autism in the United States.",
      "When talking about autism, Kennedy refers to children but doesn\u2019t mention of the needs of autistic adults, insisting that he\u2019s never seen an adult his age with symptoms of autism.",
      "Kennedy is \u201cnot just excluding the voices of autistic adults from the conversation, but excluding the fact of our existence,\u201d Ne\u2019eman said.",
      "Kennedy has also said he didn\u2019t know anyone with autism when he was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, before some modern vaccines were available.",
      "There\u2019s a reason why people were autism were rarely seen at that time, Mandell said. Like others with intellectual or physical disabilities, they were often institutionalized, often living in appalling conditions that shortened their lives.",
      "More than a century ago, when doctors first described autism, they saw it as a symptom of childhood schizophrenia. In the 1940s, doctors blamed the condition on \u201crefrigerator mothers\u201d who weren\u2019t warm enough to their children.",
      "Kristyn Roth, chief marketing officer of the Autism Society of America, said Kennedy\u2019s claims about autistic children\u2019s limited potential echo the warnings that doctors used during the mid-20th century to persuade parents to institutionalize their children, rather than raise them at home.",
      "Children with autism weren\u2019t afforded the legal right to a free public education until 1975. Children with developmental delays can receive early intervention services until age 3, then transition into special education, if needed.",
      "Today, advocacy groups say it\u2019s important to tell parents of newly diagnosed children about the many possibilities open to their kids.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible for your kid,\u201d said Gross. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s\u00a0possible for your kid when they\u2019re 3 years old,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Cutting support for people with autism",
      "Part of Kennedy\u2019s plan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d includes \u201cstreamlining\u201d and \u201crestructuring\u201d federal health agencies in ways that could hurt people with autism, Roth said.",
      "One of the most significant potential losses is the proposed dismantling of the Administration for Community Living, or ACL, which is best known for the Meals on Wheels program that delivers food to people\u2019s homes. The ACL also protects the civil rights of older adults and people with disabilities \u2014 including those with autism \u2014 and helps them live independently, rather than in institutions.",
      "According to the Trump administration, the agency\u2019s \u201ccritical programs\u201d \u2014 but not all programs \u2014 will be split across other departments. According to news reports, half of the ACL\u2019s staff has been fired.",
      "Proposals by Republicans in Congress to cut Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to pay for Trump\u2019s budget priorities could deal a devastating blow to people with autism and their families, Roth said.",
      "Many children and adults with autism receive their health care through Medicaid, which covers people with disabilities or low incomes. Health insurance is critical for people with autism, who tend to have more serious medical needs than others. Up to half of those with autism have seizures, which can be life-threatening.",
      "Medicaid also pays for screening, diagnosis, acute medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy and one-to-one aides for people who need them, among other services, Mandell said.",
      "Some states have received waivers to provide additional services through Medicaid, such as respite care for caregivers, a service that has been shown to reduce institutionalization.",
      "Medicaid is \u201ca literally lifesaving program for so many people in our community,\u201d Roth said.",
      "The Autism Society of America, which co-signed a letter to congressional leaders asking them to save the ACL, said the level of federal cost-cutting is leading to \u201cthe decimation of programs that directly serve and support the disability community, including those with autism,\u201d according to a statement from the group.",
      "If the federal government doesn\u2019t fund services that help people with autism live at home, for example, they could end up living in institutions, which are much more expensive, Mandell said.",
      "In an online statement, the Autism Self Advocacy Network said Kennedy has not consulted autism advocacy groups about any of the plans that affect their community.",
      "Although Kennedy has pledged a \u201cmassive testing and research effort\u201d to find the causes of autism, Ne\u2019eman said research dollars would be better spent investigating ways to support autistic people in their daily lives, such as addressing barriers to jobs and education.",
      "\u201cThe false idea that autism is caused by an \u2018injury,\u2019 by something external going wrong, makes people more afraid of autism and of autistics,\u201d the Autistic Self Advocacy Network wrote in a statement in April. \u201cSo does the idea that it is better for a child to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than to live as an autistic person.\u201d",
      "Concerns about cutbacks to education",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate the Department of Education, which oversees special education services and enforces the law that guarantees children with disabilities \u2014 including those with autism \u2014 receive a free public education in the least restrictive environment. The White House has promised that services for children with disabilities will be \u201cpreserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments,\u201d but many autism advocates worry that key services will be lost in the shuffle, making it harder for students to receive individual education programs and special instruction in school, as well as accommodations that help meet their needs.",
      "Twenty-two percent of families of children with disabilities experience financial hardship, such as difficulty paying a medical bill or going without care due to cost, according to a study published in JAMA on April 24. That rate is nearly twice as high as in families without children with disabilities.",
      "\u201cI have not heard Kennedy say one word about supports,\u201d Mandell said. \u201cI would love to change the conversation to talk about what we should be doing to support these individuals.\u201d",
      "Efforts to help autistic people are succeeding",
      "The report from the CDC that triggered Kennedy\u2019s recent briefing shows that increased efforts to screen young children for autism have led to an increase in the number of children diagnosed with the condition.",
      "Kennedy rejects the idea that increased awareness and screening explains the growth in autism diagnoses.",
      "Jemma Bat-Anat Page, 29, said she would not have been diagnosed with autism if she hadn\u2019t sought out testing two years ago.",
      "Page, who works in theater in Cincinnati, paid for the tests using health insurance from her employer. Page said she has been uncomfortable making eye contact since she was a child and she sometimes got in trouble for not being able to control the volume of her voice. She decided to be tested, not for accommodations or services, but simply to better understand herself.",
      "Page and her partner, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, consider themselves \u201cneurodiverse.\u201d",
      "She also likes the increasingly popular term \u201cneurospicy.\u201d",
      "Ne\u2019eman believes the actual number of people with autism may not have changed as much as statistics suggest.",
      "\u201cMany people who today get an autism diagnosis would have, in a prior generation, gotten a diagnosis of intellectual disability, mental illness or no diagnosis at all,\u201d Ne\u2019eman said."

    "story": [
      "BROWNSVILLE, Texas \u2014 Texas has a brand new city, and its name is Starbase.",
      "A vote Saturday to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city centered around Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX delivered a victory to the tech billionaire and his rocket company. As expected, the measure passed with broad support, paving the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of SpaceX employees and people connected to the company.",
      "The final vote tally Saturday night was 212 in favor of incorporation and six against; only 143 votes were needed for the measure to pass.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s officially statistically impossible for the measure to fail,\u201d Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza said. \u201cCameron County is about to have a new city.\u201d",
      "Musk celebrated the vote in a post on X Saturday night.",
      "\u201cStarbase, Texas Is now a real city!\u201d he wrote.",
      "Shortly after the vote, an X account for the new city was created.",
      "\"Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity\u2019s place in space,\" the account wrote in its first post, which was reposted to SpaceX's official account.",
      "Now that the vote has passed, commissioners in the county will canvass the results within two weeks, Garza said. A judge will then assign an order declaring the results of the election and the official incorporation of the new city.",
      "The new city of Starbase covers about 1\u00bd square miles at the southern tip of Texas, a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico border. The area is home to SpaceX headquarters, and it\u2019s where the company builds its boosters and engines and\u00a0launches its huge Starship rocket\u00a0on test flights.",
      "The ballot result was a much-needed win for Musk, who has faced widespread backlash over the past few months for his involvement with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Musk was installed as chief of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and oversaw sweeping layoffs and cuts across federal agencies.",
      "In response, protests against Musk erupted around the country and profits plummeted at the billionaire\u2019s electric car company, Tesla.",
      "Now, SpaceX will have the company town that Musk\u00a0first publicly proposed in 2021.",
      "In addition to incorporating the new city, Saturday\u2019s election also selected Starbase\u2019s first mayor \u2014\u00a0Bobby Pedden \u2014 and two city commissioners \u2014\u00a0Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka. The candidates for all three positions ran unopposed, and all three are employees of SpaceX.",
      "There were 283 people eligible to cast ballots in Saturday\u2019s Cameron County special election, according to county election records. Eligibility was determined based on if a resident\u2019s home would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city.",
      "Neither SpaceX nor Musk has detailed the purpose of incorporating a city around the rocket company\u2019s operations. There has been speculation, however, that having greater municipal control of the area could ease some of the bureaucracy and restrictions around SpaceX\u2019s tests and rocket launches.",
      "At the moment, SpaceX must obtain permission from authorities in Cameron County to close a highway and shut down public access to Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park to keep people safe during rocket launches.",
      "The frequent closures have contributed to legal complaints against SpaceX, and have drawn protests from local residents and activists, including the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, the South Texas Environmental Justice Network and Border Workers United,\u00a0as reported by CNBC.",
      "Now that SpaceX operates within the newly incorporated city of Starbase, things may soon change \u2014 though perhaps not without resistance.",

      "Trevino said any changes to the established procedures would be unnecessary.",

      "MANILA \u2014 On a balmy night outside Manila\u2019s Baclaran church, Gerald Concepcion, 32, and his fellow devotees were decorating a float of the Virgin Mary with fragrant lilies and pink carnations. He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was reelected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the Church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u201cdoes not possess a prophetic voice\u201d",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble, and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines' former president Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the Church which, in the Philippines, has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte's opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian, and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the Cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",
      "\u201cI think the conclave is going to look at a European Cardinal to become pope,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Three issues are expected to hound the next pope: clerical abuse, poor finances of the Vatican, and the ongoing cultural war between progressives and conservatives.",
      "Tagle might be one of the more popular papabile, but Collins cautioned that in every conclave, \u201cthere are always people who are being promoted more in the media than among the cardinals.\u201d",
      "\u201cA pope from Asia or Africa is a good news story, but that does not reflect the views of the cardinal electors.\u201d",
      "Camille Elemia reported from Manila and Imus, Philippines."

    "story": [
      "The federal government on Monday will resume collecting defaulted student loan payments from millions of people for the first time since the start of the pandemic, officials said.",
      "The Trump administration said it would collect the debt through a Treasury Department program that withholds payments through tax refunds, wages and government benefits.",
      "The U.S. Education Department has not collected on defaulted loans since March 2020. Of the nearly 43 million people who owe money, only a little more than a third have made regular payments, the agency said.",
      "In the last five years, student debt has grown to $1.6 trillion, officials said. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said taxpayers would now be saved from shouldering that cost.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\u201d McMahon said in an April 21 news release announcing the restart of collections.",
      "The move comes after years of legal back-and-forth about loan forgiveness and at a time when advocates say student borrowers are stretched thin from inflation and growing concerns over the cost of living.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the worst student loan landscape that we\u2019ve ever been before,\u201d said Sabrina Calazans, executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center, a nonprofit that advocates for student debt cancellation.",
      "\u201cThe plans and proposals being put forth by the Trump administration are going to harm millions of individuals and families,\u201d Calazans added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a financial catastrophe where folks will not be able to meet their basic needs.\u201d",
      "What happens now?",
      "All borrowers in default should have received an email from the Office of Federal Student Aid alerting them to the changes.",
      "Officials said the email urges borrowers to contact the Default Resolution Group to either make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-based repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation \u2014 a process that can erase a default status if the borrower makes a set of payments during a specific time frame, depending on the type of loan.",
      "To schedule monthly payments, borrowers who have not changed their marital status or income would have needed to send their most recent Federal 1040 tax return to the Education Department, according to instructions outlined on the Default Resolution Group\u2019s website.",
      "The Education Department said it will be using the Treasury Department\u2019s Offset Program to collect on the debt by withholding payments through tax refunds, salaries and benefits like Social Security payments.",
      "Under the program, the government can withhold entire federal tax refunds and up to 15% of a federal worker\u2019s disposable pay. The government said the FSA would send notices about wage garnishment later this summer.",
      "In an April opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal, McMahon said borrowers who don\u2019t make payments on time will see their credit scores go down, \u201cand in some cases their wages automatically garnished.\u201d",
      "What happened to loan forgiveness?",
      "Before leaving the White House in January, then-President Joe Biden announced his administration had canceled student debt for more than 5 million people, including many who attended schools that defrauded students, like DeVry University, as well as public service workers and those with total and permanent disabilities.",
      "\u201cSince Day One of my Administration, I promised to ensure higher-education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity, and I\u2019m proud to say we have forgiven more student loan debt than any other administration in history,\u201d Biden said in a statement at the time.",
      "In its April news release, however, Trump\u2019s Education Department made it clear that \u201cthere will not be any mass loan forgiveness\u201d going forward.",
      "McMahon blamed the Biden administration for transferring hundreds of billions of dollars in debt to taxpayers and keeping borrowers in a \u201cconfusing limbo\u201d about payments.",
      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump paused collection on most federal student loans in March 2020, and Biden continued to pause collection when he took office in 2021.",
      "Biden had proposed allowing eligible borrowers to cancel up to $20,000 in debt until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against his student loan debt relief plan in 2023. The plan would have cost more than $400 billion, and about 43 million Americans would have been eligible to participate.",
      "In the Wall Street Journal op-ed, McMahon said Biden \u201cnever had the authority to forgive student loans across the board.\u201d",
      "She said resuming collections was not an act of unkindness to student borrowers but an act of fairness.",
      "\u201cBorrowing money and failing to pay it back isn\u2019t a victimless offense. Debt doesn\u2019t go away; it gets transferred to others,\u201d she said. \u201cIf borrowers don\u2019t pay their debts to the government, taxpayers do.\u201d"

The Costume Institute \u2014 which is funded by proceeds raised at the Met Gala \u2014 holds tens of thousands of items in its archives dating back hundreds of years, and is housed in the Anna Wintour Costume Center of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, named for the Vogue editor-in-chief, who has chaired the gala since the 1990s.",
      "This year\u2019s theme will \u201cexplore the role of sartorial style in forming Black identities, focusing on the emergence, significance, and proliferation of the Black dandy,\u201d according to Vogue, and is inspired by guest curator Monica L. Miller\u2019s 2009 book \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack style is really related to thinking about how fashion and power connect,\u201d Miller told Vogue. \u201cThe way that people are styled, are fashioned or fashion themselves, in response to the degree of agency that they feel \u2014 silhouettes change, use of pattern, color \u2014 all of those things change in relation to time, and relationship to history.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuperfine\u201d is organized into 12 sections focusing on traits that define the style: ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "\u201cHistorically, made-to-wear clothing was not as available for Black people. So the tailor became a very, very important person in a community,\u201d Miller said, adding: \u201cThe tailor in Black communities was somebody who would know about people\u2019s lives because of the ways in which people would visit the tailor for these special occasions.\u201d",
      "How will celebrities dress according to the theme?",
      "The dress code is \u201ctailored for you,\u201d so perfectly tailored menswear staples will likely dominate the famed carpeted steps leading up to the event.",
      "Viewers may expect to see \u201ctakes on suiting \u2014 from versions of the zoot silhouette popularized by jazz musicians in the 1940s to the bold, colorful styles worn by Congolese sapeurs,\u201d according to Vogue.",
      "What celebrities are on the host committee this year?",
      "In addition to Wintour, actor Colman Domingo, musicians Pharrell Williams and A$AP Rocky, and Formula One competitor Lewis Hamilton will co-chair the gala. NBA star LeBron James will serve as an honorary co-chair.",
      "The 2025 host committee features Andr\u00e9 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Tyla, Usher and Kara Walker.",
      "Who else is going to the Met Gala?",
      "The Met Gala guest list is top secret, but usually contains a few hundred singers, actors, athletes, poets and other celebrities. Some stars return to the red carpet almost every year, such as Rihanna and her partner,\u00a0A$AP Rocky, plus Zendaya, the Kardashians, Sarah Jessica Parker and Blake Lively.",
      "For those who aren\u2019t handpicked to attend the gala, tickets are available for $75,000, but the final guest list is still approved by Wintour.",
      "Who is boycotting the Met Gala?",
      "Outspoken Kennedy heir Jack Schlossberg is boycotting the Met Gala, he announced in an Instagram post in April. The former Vogue political correspondent said, \u201cI can\u2019t go in good conscience with so much happening around the world and at home,\u201d and tagged Wintour in the video."

      "But far from the\u00a0Sistine Chapel\u00a0where\u00a0cloistered cardinals\u00a0will cast votes, people are placing bets on who will be chosen as the next pope. From cash bets on websites to online games modeled after\u00a0fantasy football leagues\u00a0and casual wagers among friends and families, the popularity of guessing and gambling on the future of the papacy is increasing worldwide, experts and participants say.",
      "It\u2019s even topped the Europa League soccer tournament and Formula One drivers\u2019 championship, said Sam Eaton, U.K. manager for Oddschecker, a leading online platform analyzing odds across sports, events and other betting markets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge level of interest globally,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a market like this where we\u2019ve had so many countries interested in seeing odds.\u201d",
      "Around the world, thousands of bets on the next pope",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people from some 140 countries have visited Oddschecker to review each cardinal\u2019s chances of becoming the next pope, Eaton said. He noted special eagerness in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.",
      "In the U.K., about 30,000 pounds (almost $40,000) have been wagered with one leading online betting platform as of this week, Eaton said \u2014 a far cry from 1.2 million pounds on the singing contest Eurovision but still noteworthy as a trend, with the conclave days away.",
      "\u201cBetting on the next pope is definitely a niche market in the grand scheme of things, but it generates global interest,\u201d said Lee Phelps, a spokesman for William Hill, one of the U.K.\u2019s biggest bookmakers.",
      "\u201cSince April 21, we\u2019ve taken thousands of bets, and it\u2019s the busiest of all our non-sports betting markets,\u201d said Phelps, who expects a surge in interest once the conclave begins Wednesday.",
      "Betting on elections, papal conclaves and all manner of global events is almost a tradition of its own in the U.K., but such betting is not legal in the United States. BetMGM, one of the world\u2019s top sports-betting companies, said it would not have any bets up.",
      "But Eaton noted that in the unregulated, illegal space, one of the biggest sites has $10 million wagered so far in pope bets.",
      "Fantasy \u201cteams\u201d of cardinals",
      "In Italy, betting on the papal election \u2014 and all religious events \u2014 is forbidden.",
      "Some people in Rome are making friendly, informal wagers \u2014 the equivalent of $20 on a favorite cardinal, with the loser pledging to host a dinner or buy a pizza night out.",
      "Others are turning to an online game called Fantapapa, or Fantasy Pope, which mimics popular fantasy football and soccer leagues. More than 60,000 people are playing, each choosing 11\u00a0cardinals\u00a0\u2014 as if for a soccer team \u2014 whom they believe have the best shot at becoming the next pope.",
      "They also draft the\u00a0top contender, or captain. As with online wagers, the No. 1 choice for fantasy players has been Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, closely followed by Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun game to play with friends and have a laugh,\u201d Italian student Federico La Rocca, 23, said. \u201cInitially my dad sent it to me ironically, but now that it\u2019s going to be the conclave, I decided to have a go and try it.\u201d",
      "La Rocca said he chose Tagle because \u201che looks like a nice guy and fun person.\u201d",
      "Players\u2019 selections determine the number of points they rake in. But what\u2019s the jackpot?",
      "\u201cEternal glory,\u201d joked Mauro Vanetti, who created the game when\u00a0Francis was hospitalized\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "Vanetti said he and his co-founder are against gambling, but they wanted to create something fun around the event.",
      "\u201cIt seems like in Italy there\u2019s a certain inquisitiveness about the mechanisms of the Catholic hierarchy, but it\u2019s a critical curiosity, a sarcastic and playful curiosity, so we were interested in this jesting spirit for such a solemn event,\u201d Vanetti said. \u201cIn some ways it deflates the sacredness, in a nonaggressive way.\u201d",
      "Some concerns about betting on a solemn event",
      "Beyond simply picking who the next pope will be, players and gamblers also can guess how many tries it will take the cardinals to choose the leader, which day of the week he\u2019ll be elected, what new name he will decide on, or where his priorities will land on the progressive-conservative scale.",
      "While the game and some of the bets have a novel or fun nature, anti-gambling advocates have raised overall concerns about legal gaming and the growing popularity of wagering on all manner of events.",
      "A study published last fall found that 10% of young men in the U.S. show behavior that indicates a\u00a0gambling problem, which is a\u00a0rising concern in other parts of the world, too.",
      "And for gambling around the papacy in general, some have raised religious concerns. Catholic teaching doesn\u2019t go so far as to call games of chance or wagers sinful, but its Catechism warns that \u201cthe passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement.\u201d",
      "It says gambling becomes \u201cmorally unacceptable\u201d if it gravely affects a person\u2019s livelihood."

    "story": [
      "In the week following President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement, it looked like the stock market had seen a ghost.",
      "Over the course of seven days following his April 2 announcement, the S&P 500 lost more than 12%, a decline not typically seen outside of extreme events like the Covid-19 pandemic and the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. That stretch last month also saw the fifth-worst two-day percentage decline since World War II.",
      "Government bond yields, too, began to creep steadily upward, making it more expensive for the U.S. to borrow money, amid signs that both the substance and erratic rollout of Trump\u2019s tariff plan were testing traders\u2019 faith in the United States\u2019 ability to make timely payments on its debt.",
      "Stocks around the world sold off, too.",
      "\u201cApril was an absolutely seismic month in financial markets, as the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs led to a huge global sell-off,\u201d analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cThe initial moves were truly historic in their speed.\u201d",
      "With the stock and bond markets blaring red alerts, Trump backed off some of his tariffs on April 9, triggering euphoria among investors. After he announced a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs for \u201cnon-retaliating\u201d countries, the S&P saw its best daily performance in nearly 17 years, with a 9.5% gain. At the same time, the sell-off in Treasurys stabilized.",
      "Now, 32 days after the historic Rose Garden speech, stocks have executed a stunning comeback of sorts, with the broader market largely returning to where it was when the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs were first announced. Volatility in government borrowing costs, too, has leveled off.",
      "The gains are relative: Stocks remain about 6% below their pre-Inauguration Day levels. But some blue chip companies like Apple are still hobbling. The iPhone maker\u2019s stock is down more than 20% since its all-time high last winter, though partly for reasons beyond the president\u2019s policies.\u00a0Tesla, which is helmed by Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump,\u00a0is still 40% off its December peak.",
      "Nevertheless, the broader recovery has been significant. According to Dow Jones, the eight trading days through Thursday last week saw the biggest gain for the S&P 500 since November 2020, when markets showed their first signs of recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "And with Friday\u2019s close, the index saw its longest winning streak in 20 years.",
      "Experts say the\u00a0recovery has been fueled by a combination of Trump\u2019s softening tone on tariffs and investors entering an \u201cacceptance\u201d stage that whatever the president ends up saying, tariffs are here to stay in some form or another.",
      "\u201cMarkets are adjusting to the tariffs story and saying, \u2018OK, this has happened, now what do we do about it?\u2019\u201d said Roxanna Islam, head of research at VettaFi, an asset management platform. \u201cPeople are starting to look more forward than backward.\u201d",
      "If flows of money into a popular low-cost investment vehicle are any indication, the recovery has been led by so-called \u201cretail\u201d investors, opportunistic buyers who are more apt to make daily market trades. That group stands in contrast to longer-term investors like 401(k) holders or large institutions, which typically take a more measured, long-term view of investing.",
      "According to the Vanguard investment group, which runs investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), \u201cbulls,\u201d or net buyers of stocks, outnumbered \u201cbears\u201d (net sellers) by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1 among self-directed investors. The Vanguard ETF saw a $21 billion inflow last month, the most in its 15-year history and the fifth-largest amount ever taken in by a fund on a monthly basis, Bloomberg News reported.",
      "\u201cIt would be simplistic to say it\u2019s just retail \u2014 but to a large extent it has been,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at the Interactive Brokers financial group.",
      "The retail investment boom surfaced during the pandemic, when day traders turned to playing markets amid nationwide shutdowns. The trend became best known for fueling mania in \u201cmeme\u201d stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond that would see intense run-ups in price amid online speculation about company turnarounds.",
      "The meme-stock days have largely faded, but the impulse to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d \u2014 the popular phrase used to describe when investors bet on stock prices rising after they\u2019ve gone down \u2014 remains, Sosnick said.",
      "\u201cI think the key element has been American investors\u2019 unrelenting faith that every dip is a buying opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if enough have this faith, it can make itself true.\u201d",
      "The recovery remains extremely fragile. Stocks are highly sensitive to any hints of trade deals, especially with China, which was excluded from Trump\u2019s initial tariff pause. As recently as Friday, stocks surged on a Wall Street Journal report that China was open to addressing Trump\u2019s concerns about its role in the fentanyl crisis as an entry point for both sides softening their trade dispute.",
      "And the overall economic picture remains uncertain. Despite a strong jobs report Friday, other indicators suggest the economy is throttling back. Economic growth was negative for the first three months of the year, and while much of that was a function of a surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a 1.8% quarterly gain after surging to a 4% gain in the fourth quarter last year.",
      "Friday\u2019s jobs report also showed the median duration of unemployment is surging and average hourly earnings growth is slowing.",
      "Companies, too, are lowering their financial guidance for the year, or withdrawing it as they await clarity on how Trump\u2019s tariffs shake out.",
      "As a result, overall investment sentiment remains bearish, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), whose regular survey most recently showed that expectations that stock prices will fall over the next six months increased 3.7 percentage points to 59.3%.",
      "\u201cBearish sentiment is unusually high and is above its historical average of 31.0% for the 22nd time in 24 weeks,\u201d the AAII said. \u201cBearish sentiment has now been above 50% for 10-consecutive weeks, the longest period over 50% in the survey\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Even for people without direct exposure to the stock market, the negative sentiment can have an impact on the broader economy, said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.",
      "\u201cThose negative headlines do take a toll beyond those who have a particular stake in the market,\u201d he said.",
      "There are also signs that the \u201cSell America\u201d trade is lingering, according to Bob Elliott, CEO of the Unlimited Funds investment group, who noted in a post on X Friday that the value of the U.S. dollar remains well below where it was just before Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcement, while gold and foreign stocks have been outperforming U.S. equities.",
      "There\u2019s been a \u201crotation away from the U.S.\u201d even with better-than-expected data, Elliott said.",
      "In short, it remains to be seen where the market goes from here.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Islam, of VettaFi. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of that uncertainty.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In just two months on the job, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised the profile of autism more than any recent public official.",
      "Autism advocacy groups typically welcome more attention to their cause. But many autistic people say Kennedy is exploiting their community \u2014 and perpetuating harmful stereotypes \u2014 as part of his decadeslong campaign against vaccines, even as the Trump administration threatens to eliminate services that help people with autism reach their full potential.",
      "At an April press conference on autism rates among school-age kids, Kennedy described autism as an epidemic and a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are kids who will never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use the toilet unassisted,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "In response, 15 advocacy groups issued a joint statement calling for autistic people to be treated with respect and support. The groups said they are \u201cdeeply concerned by growing public rhetoric and policy decisions\u201d that fail to \u201creflect the inherent value, rights and diverse needs of autistic people.\u201d",
      "Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, was one of many people to speak out. Gross and her brother have autism.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge for our parents, but our family wasn\u2019t destroyed,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Ari Ne\u2019eman, an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said he sees Kennedy\u2019s disparaging remarks as \u201cpart of the long and unfortunate history of fearmongering in the autism world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an unscrupulous industry of alternative medicine providers who exploit families by charging them tens of thousands of dollars to \u2018recover\u2019 people with autism,\u201d said Ne\u2019eman, who has autism. \u201cThe way that industry works is by terrifying families.\u201d",
      "Even among people with intellectual disabilities \u2014 a category that includes 40% of people with autism \u2014 1 in 5 held a paid job in the community in 2020.",
      "Kennedy later said he was referring to people with \u201cprofound autism,\u201d including those without access to speech.\u00a0Research suggests 10% to 27% of autistic people are nonverbal or have other significant needs, a rate that has remained relatively consistent since 2000.",
      "Philip Weintraub, 53, didn\u2019t speak a word until he was 5 years old.",
      "But he received speech therapy throughout elementary school. Occupational therapy improved his motor skills, which allowed him to play soccer and basketball in middle school and high school, as well as softball as an adult.",
      "After high school, he began volunteering for the Bill Clinton campaign and later worked for the White House. Weintraub now works at the Universal Services Administrative Company, which connects people to broadband services. When he returned to school to become certified in computer science, his school provided someone to take notes and gave him extra time on a test.",
      "He and his wife, Liz, who has cerebral palsy, live in the Washington, D.C., area. Weintraub noted that they have gone on many dates.",
      "\u201cWe are coming up on our 20th anniversary,\u201d he said.",
      "Many autistic people and their advocates say Kennedy\u2019s remarks on autism perpetuate stigmas about the disorder, a neurodevelopmental disability in which people experience difficulties with social interaction or communication and often have restricted interests or repetitive behaviors.",
      "Symptoms can vary dramatically from person to person, however, and some people with autism need higher levels of support than others.",
      "Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, said she welcomed Kennedy\u2019s focus on autistic people who need more intensive support. However, she objects to the suggestion that the lives of some autistic people have little worth.",
      "Kennedy \u201cmade it sound like these individuals\u2019 lives had no value if they couldn\u2019t pay taxes,\u201d Singer said. \u201cThat they couldn\u2019t love and weren\u2019t worthy of love. My daughter has profound autism and so does my older brother. They both live lives of meaning and dignity.\u201d",
      "Although attitudes toward autism have changed significantly in recent decades, Kennedy doesn\u2019t seem to have kept up, said David Mandell, associate director of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s Center for Autism Research.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments about autism echo the language of some autism organizations from 20 years ago, when advocates often spoke of \u201ccuring\u201d the condition, Mandell said.",
      "In a written statement to NBC News, an HHS spokesperson said, \u201cSecretary Kennedy remains committed to working toward a society where people with autism have access to meaningful opportunities, appropriate supports and the full respect and recognition they deserve. His statements emphasized the need for increased research into environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, not to stigmatize individuals with autism or their families. HHS supports ongoing collaboration and research to both identify the causes of autism and provide the best possible care and management strategies for those impacted.\u201d",
      "Where were the autistic people?",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are more than 5 million adults with autism in the United States.",
      "When talking about autism, Kennedy refers to children but doesn\u2019t mention of the needs of autistic adults, insisting that he\u2019s never seen an adult his age with symptoms of autism.",
      "Kennedy is \u201cnot just excluding the voices of autistic adults from the conversation, but excluding the fact of our existence,\u201d Ne\u2019eman said.",
      "Kennedy has also said he didn\u2019t know anyone with autism when he was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, before some modern vaccines were available.",
      "There\u2019s a reason why people were autism were rarely seen at that time, Mandell said. Like others with intellectual or physical disabilities, they were often institutionalized, often living in appalling conditions that shortened their lives.",
      "More than a century ago, when doctors first described autism, they saw it as a symptom of childhood schizophrenia. In the 1940s, doctors blamed the condition on \u201crefrigerator mothers\u201d who weren\u2019t warm enough to their children.",
      "Kristyn Roth, chief marketing officer of the Autism Society of America, said Kennedy\u2019s claims about autistic children\u2019s limited potential echo the warnings that doctors used during the mid-20th century to persuade parents to institutionalize their children, rather than raise them at home.",
      "Children with autism weren\u2019t afforded the legal right to a free public education until 1975. Children with developmental delays can receive early intervention services until age 3, then transition into special education, if needed.",
      "Today, advocacy groups say it\u2019s important to tell parents of newly diagnosed children about the many possibilities open to their kids.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible for your kid,\u201d said Gross. \u201cNo one knows what\u2019s\u00a0possible for your kid when they\u2019re 3 years old,\u201d Gross said.",
      "Cutting support for people with autism",
      "Part of Kennedy\u2019s plan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d includes \u201cstreamlining\u201d and \u201crestructuring\u201d federal health agencies in ways that could hurt people with autism, Roth said.",
      "One of the most significant potential losses is the proposed dismantling of the Administration for Community Living, or ACL, which is best known for the Meals on Wheels program that delivers food to people\u2019s homes. The ACL also protects the civil rights of older adults and people with disabilities \u2014 including those with autism \u2014 and helps them live independently, rather than in institutions.",
      "According to the Trump administration, the agency\u2019s \u201ccritical programs\u201d \u2014 but not all programs \u2014 will be split across other departments. According to news reports, half of the ACL\u2019s staff has been fired.",
      "Proposals by Republicans in Congress to cut Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to pay for Trump\u2019s budget priorities could deal a devastating blow to people with autism and their families, Roth said.",
      "Many children and adults with autism receive their health care through Medicaid, which covers people with disabilities or low incomes. Health insurance is critical for people with autism, who tend to have more serious medical needs than others. Up to half of those with autism have seizures, which can be life-threatening.",
      "Medicaid also pays for screening, diagnosis, acute medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy and one-to-one aides for people who need them, among other services, Mandell said.",
      "Some states have received waivers to provide additional services through Medicaid, such as respite care for caregivers, a service that has been shown to reduce institutionalization.",
      "Medicaid is \u201ca literally lifesaving program for so many people in our community,\u201d Roth said.",
      "The Autism Society of America, which co-signed a letter to congressional leaders asking them to save the ACL, said the level of federal cost-cutting is leading to \u201cthe decimation of programs that directly serve and support the disability community, including those with autism,\u201d according to a statement from the group.",
      "If the federal government doesn\u2019t fund services that help people with autism live at home, for example, they could end up living in institutions, which are much more expensive, Mandell said.",
      "In an online statement, the Autism Self Advocacy Network said Kennedy has not consulted autism advocacy groups about any of the plans that affect their community.",
      "Although Kennedy has pledged a \u201cmassive testing and research effort\u201d to find the causes of autism, Ne\u2019eman said research dollars would be better spent investigating ways to support autistic people in their daily lives, such as addressing barriers to jobs and education.",
      "\u201cThe false idea that autism is caused by an \u2018injury,\u2019 by something external going wrong, makes people more afraid of autism and of autistics,\u201d the Autistic Self Advocacy Network wrote in a statement in April. \u201cSo does the idea that it is better for a child to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than to live as an autistic person.\u201d",
      "Concerns about cutbacks to education",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate the Department of Education, which oversees special education services and enforces the law that guarantees children with disabilities \u2014 including those with autism \u2014 receive a free public education in the least restrictive environment. The White House has promised that services for children with disabilities will be \u201cpreserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments,\u201d but many autism advocates worry that key services will be lost in the shuffle, making it harder for students to receive individual education programs and special instruction in school, as well as accommodations that help meet their needs.",
      "Twenty-two percent of families of children with disabilities experience financial hardship, such as difficulty paying a medical bill or going without care due to cost, according to a study published in JAMA on April 24. That rate is nearly twice as high as in families without children with disabilities.",
      "\u201cI have not heard Kennedy say one word about supports,\u201d Mandell said. \u201cI would love to change the conversation to talk about what we should be doing to support these individuals.\u201d",
      "Efforts to help autistic people are succeeding",
      "The report from the CDC that triggered Kennedy\u2019s recent briefing shows that increased efforts to screen young children for autism have led to an increase in the number of children diagnosed with the condition.",
      "Kennedy rejects the idea that increased awareness and screening explains the growth in autism diagnoses.",
      "Jemma Bat-Anat Page, 29, said she would not have been diagnosed with autism if she hadn\u2019t sought out testing two years ago.",
      "Page, who works in theater in Cincinnati, paid for the tests using health insurance from her employer. Page said she has been uncomfortable making eye contact since she was a child and she sometimes got in trouble for not being able to control the volume of her voice. She decided to be tested, not for accommodations or services, but simply to better understand herself.",
      "Page and her partner, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, consider themselves \u201cneurodiverse.\u201d",
      "She also likes the increasingly popular term \u201cneurospicy.\u201d",
      "Ne\u2019eman believes the actual number of people with autism may not have changed as much as statistics suggest.",
      "\u201cMany people who today get an autism diagnosis would have, in a prior generation, gotten a diagnosis of intellectual disability, mental illness or no diagnosis at all,\u201d Ne\u2019eman said."

      "The Houthi rebels have been striking Israel throughout the war in Gaza in solidarity with Palestinians. The attack on Ben-Gurion International Airport came hours before top Israeli Cabinet ministers were set to vote on whether to intensify the country\u2019s\u00a0military operations in the Gaza Strip. The army meanwhile began calling up thousands of reserves in anticipation of a wider operation in Gaza, officials said.",
      "The missile launch Sunday set off air raid sirens in multiple parts of Israel. A plume of smoke was visible at the airport, according to footage shared by Israeli media. Passengers were heard yelling and scrambling for cover.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the projectile, which landed in a field near an access road leading to airport parking lots, was the missile or its fragments, or an interceptor from Israel\u2019s air defense systems. It left a deep crater in the ground and a nearby road was littered with dirt.",
      "Israel vows to respond to the airport attack",
      "Police said that air, road and rail traffic were halted following the attack. The traffic resumed after about an hour, Israel Airports Authority said. Israel\u2019s paramedic service Magen David Adom said four people were lightly wounded.",

      "As part of its efforts to pressure the militant group Hamas to negotiate on Israel\u2019s terms for a new ceasefire, Israel in early March halted the entry of goods into Gaza. That has plunged the territory of 2.3 million people into what is believed to be the worst humanitarian crisis since the war began.",
      "An eight-week-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that brought a lull in fighting and freed Israeli hostages collapsed in March.\u00a0Israel resumed its strikes on Gaza\u00a0on March 18 and has captured swaths of the coastal enclave. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed, according to local health officials.",
      "Fighting in Gaza drags on",
      "At least seven Palestinians including two parents and their two children, ages 2 and 4, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in southern and central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medics said. Asked about the strikes, the Israeli military had no direct comment.",

      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.",
      "The fighting has displaced more than 90% of Gaza\u2019s population, often multiple times. Hunger has been widespread and\u00a0the shortage of food has set off looting."

      "On March 23, Alvarado was riding the horse Term at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Fla., when his thoroughbred suffered a heart attack, sending Alvarado off his saddle. He was clipped by another horse while on the ground tending to his own, resulting in a hairline fracture in his shoulder that would sideline him for three weeks.",
      "Alvarado was heartbroken. His dream was winning the Derby, and he felt had a legitimate shot this year with his horse Sovereignty. Alvarado wasn\u2019t sure if he would ever get an opportunity like this again if he didn\u2019t return in time.",

      "A vote Saturday to decide whether to turn part of south Texas into a new city centered around Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX delivered a victory to the tech billionaire and his rocket company. As expected, the measure passed with broad support, paving the way for a newly incorporated city made up almost exclusively of SpaceX employees and people connected to the company.",
      "The final vote tally Saturday night was 212 in favor of incorporation and six against; only 143 votes were needed for the measure to pass.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s officially statistically impossible for the measure to fail,\u201d Cameron County Elections Administrator Remi Garza said. \u201cCameron County is about to have a new city.\u201d",

      "\u201cStarbase, Texas Is now a real city!\u201d he wrote.",

      "\"Becoming a city will help us continue building the best community possible for the men and women building the future of humanity\u2019s place in space,\" the account wrote in its first post, which was reposted to SpaceX's official account.",
      "Now that the vote has passed, commissioners in the county will canvass the results within two weeks, Garza said. A judge will then assign an order declaring the results of the election and the official incorporation of the new city.",
      "The new city of Starbase covers about 1\u00bd square miles at the southern tip of Texas, a coastal spot nestled against the Mexico border. The area is home to SpaceX headquarters, and it\u2019s where the company builds its boosters and engines and\u00a0launches its huge Starship rocket\u00a0on test flights.",
      "The ballot result was a much-needed win for Musk, who has faced widespread backlash over the past few months for his involvement with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Musk was installed as chief of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and oversaw sweeping layoffs and cuts across federal agencies.",

The candidates for all three positions ran unopposed, and all three are employees of SpaceX.",
      "There were 283 people eligible to cast ballots in Saturday\u2019s Cameron County special election, according to county election records. Eligibility was determined based on if a resident\u2019s home would fall within the boundaries of the proposed new city.",
      "Neither SpaceX nor Musk has detailed the purpose of incorporating a city around the rocket company\u2019s operations.

At the time, it was assumed that they also had a triplet who died in childbirth.",
      "At the end of the film, Emily goes to prison for killing her sister and attempting to frame her husband Sean (Henry Golding) in a murder-suicide. She also shot Sean after she found out that he had slept with Stephanie when they believed that Emily had died.",

      "While the original idea was \"more of a caper\" with Emily undercover and dressing like a nun and a \"normal person,\" Feig called the new version more of a mystery.",
      "\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a mystery in real life, everybody jumps to their conclusion,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought, \u2018God, if people had the ability to arrest people, there\u2019d be a lot of people getting falsely accused and arrested.\u2019 Everybody thinks they know people\u2019s motives.\u201d",
      "The director also commented on Emily's altruistic decision about the custody of her son Nicky after the fallout from her crimes and her sister's recent murders.",
      "\u201cEmily knows that she\u2019s a well-meaning mother, but she\u2019s probably not the best example to bring up a child,\u201d Feig said. \u201cI respect that she has the smarts to do that now that Sean is gone. She does the selfless thing, if you will.\u201d",
      "Will there be a 'A Simple Favor 3'?",
      "While director Paul Feig has yet to confirm another sequel to \"A Simple Favor,\" the \"Bridesmaids\" director said \"Another Simple Favor\" does leave the door open for a continuation of the story.",
      "\u201cCharity is a loose cannon,\u201d Feig told EW. \u201cSo there are lots of places for her to go. Let\u2019s just say, I hope to see Charity again.\u201d",
      "With the film having an open ending, in which viewers aren't privy to the \"simple favor\" that Dante\u2019s mother, Portia, asks of Emily, Feig explained to EW that the ideas for a follow up are \u201call sitting right there to be picked off the tree.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, as much as I don\u2019t like to do sequels and have avoided them, I have no rule against three-quels,\" he said. \"There\u2019s much more fun to be had with these characters and to see what they can get into and how they can get out of it.\u201d",
      "So what exactly is that \"simple favor\" that Emily has been tasked with?",
      "Feig teased \u201cit\u2019s something that probably nobody else in the family would want to do.\u201d",

      "So, what prompted his return?",
      "\"I just felt that I had a few things left to give,\" he said. \"And my wife kind of convinced me to do this and so that's why I'm doing it.\"",

      "\"That does not mean the same thing now anymore,\" Kate Rice said.",
      "\"The fact that she's ruined because she's potentially not a virgin anymore \u2014 we didn't want to do that, and so we found a solution that we think updates it and gives the characters more dignity and more chance to grow as well,\" Angourie Rice added. \"We really wanted the female characters to have the opportunity to explore more in the way that Jane Austen wouldn't have had the freedom to do.\"",

      "The 53-year-old actor shut down a London Times reporter who asked him about his and Wood's rumored behind-the-scenes feud. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have that conversation,\u201d Goggins said, per the London Times.",
      "The reporter, Ed Potton, described in his published piece how the  interview went \"off the rails\" after he brought up the fact that Goggins and Wood, 31, who played love interests \"The White Lotus,\" no longer follow each other on  Instagram.",
      "The article said that Goggins' publicists \u2014 two were present \u2014 intervened.",
      "First, Goggins\u2019 American publicist interrupted the interview to tell Potton, \u201cWe\u2019re not going there, thank you.\u201d The actor's British publicist also interjected to say, \u201cNext question.\u201d",
      "Rumors of a feud between Goggins and Wood heated up after fans noticed the pair, who once praised each other in effusive Instagram comments, no longer interacted on the platform, yet they still follow other \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d Season 3 cast members.",
      "Though the conversation pivoted to Goggins' upcoming movie, \"The Uninvited,\" written and directed by Goggins' wife Nadia Conners, it eventually made its way to a recent \"Saturday Night Live\" parody of \"The White Lotus,\" which was slammed for poking fun at Wood's appearance.",
      "Though Wood criticized the sketch \u2014\u00a0which featured \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Sarah Sherman wearing prosthetic teeth \u2014\u00a0 for being \u201cmean and unfunny,\u201d Goggins, who hosts \u201cSNL\u201d on May 10, applauded it on the show\u2019s official Instagram page.",
      "\u201cHahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,\u201d Goggins wrote in a since-deleted comment.",
      "Right after Potton brought up the \"SNL\" sketch, the actor's British publicist interrupted the interview again to say, \"Shall we talk about\u00a0'The Uninvited'\u00a0a bit more?\"",
      "When Potton reacted with a \"splutter,\" Goggins mocked him. \"Thinly veiled, my friend. The thing you\u2019re least interested in,\" he teased.",
      "Before the interview concluded, Potton brought up Wood again only to be cut off once more. \"There is no conversation to be had about that. Sharing politics on social media \u2014 it\u2019s in a vacuum,\" Goggins told him.",
      "When Potton made a last \"forlorn\" attempt to get Goggins talking about his co-star, Goggins became irritated. \u201cWhat the f---, Ed!\u201d Goggins said. \u201cCome on buddy. Wow.\u201d",
      "Goggins' American publicist then stepped in a final time, telling the reporter, \u201cWe\u2019re going to end it there.\"",

      "Isaacs joked that fans who sleuth the internet for gossip  \u2014\u00a0like an \u201camateur Sherlock Holmes\" \u2014\u00a0should cut it out.",
      "\"First of all, it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d said Isaacs, adding, \"Nobody has the slightest clue what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Isaacs previously revealed that he had been \"involved in some off-screen drama\" while filming the series.",

      "\u201cThere were alliances that formed and broke, romances that formed and broke, friendships that formed and broke. It\u2019s a long period of time for people to be away from their family with an open bar and all the wildness being in Thailand allows,\" he added.",

He said yes!\u201d",

      "\u201c\u2018The Intruder\u2019\u00a0is about a woman trapped in her remote cabin by a terrible storm, and she invites in a pre-teen girl who she finds squatting in her tool shed.\u00a0But as the night goes on, she discovers that the girl might be even more dangerous than the storm raging outside,\u201d McFadden tells TODAY.com in an interview over email.",
      "While she\u2019s a bestselling author many times over, writing is actually McFadden\u2019s side hustle. By day, she\u2019s a doctor specializing in brain injuries. In fact, Freida McFadden is her pen name.",
      "In her books, like \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d and \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d twists come fast (and unexpectedly). Where does she come up with those plot lines?",
      "\u201cI am always tempted to answer, \u2018my brain\u2019!\u00a0I definitely have a very analytic brain,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cWhen I was a teenager, I was on the math team and solving puzzles was very fun for me.",
      "\u201cBut it does seem like readers expect more in a twist these days because everything has already been done.\u00a0You have to step out of the box of: \u2018The suspects were A, B, C, D, and A is the killer.\u2019\u00a0It\u2019s not even enough to say E is the killer,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt has to be E is the killer because he is actually B and was the victim\u2019s mother and his daughter, and also was dead the whole time.\u201d",
      "She notes that it can be frustrating to have a \u201cgreat idea\u201d but still be missing the \u201cgreat twist\u201d \u2014 \u201cyet it\u2019s always exciting and satisfying when I do come up with it.\u201d",
      "Her novels tend to show women using their smarts to outrun dangerous situations and people. This time around, the inspiration for Ella, one of the main characters of \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d was close to home.",
      "\u201cOne of my biggest inspirations for this book was my own daughter, who is about the same age as Ella, and in my opinion, just as much of a badass,\u201d she says.",
      "Below, read a preview of her upcoming novel, set to publish in October 2025.",
      "Read an excerpt of 'The Intruder'",
      "There is at least a 50% chance that in the next 24 hours, the roof of the cabin I\u2019m renting will collapse and kill me.",
      "It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the rest of my life.",
      "There\u2019s not much I can do much about my shattered life, but the roof issue is more surmountable. I have been calling my landlord, Rudy, for the last month to try and fix it. Every day, I find a few new shingles on the ground next to the cabin, and one day, I\u2019m fairly sure I\u2019ll sit on my living room sofa and look straight up to see the moon.",
      "And then a few days ago, my calls became more urgent. There\u2019s a storm coming, and if this roof doesn\u2019t get fixed ASAP, I could die. So I told Rudy he needed to get his butt over here \u2014 now. I wasn\u2019t nice, but I said what I had to say.",
      "Now, a dozen messages later, Rudy is finally here in the flesh.",
      "As we stand together just outside the cabin, Rudy squints up at my roof with his droopy blue eyes. He\u2019s a scrawny man in his late 50s who looks like he only eats one or two nonliquid meals per day. He scratches the gray stubble on his chin and adjusts the worn gray baseball cap he always wears. As usual, he reeks of cigarette smoke. The stench of it was overpowering when I first moved into the cabin, and it took me a week to get it aired out. It still clings to some of the furniture months later.",
      "\u201cLooks OK to me, Casey,\u201d he says.",
      "My fists clench in barely restrained rage. \u201cHow? How does it look OK? There are shingles all over the ground!\u201d",
      "I in fact gathered the flat rectangular shingles into a little pile that I now gesture toward angrily. I don\u2019t entirely understand how a roof is constructed, but I know those things are needed to keep it together. The fact that they are falling off does not bode well for my roof.",
      "At least this is just a rainstorm. Once it snows in a month or so? Forget it. I\u2019m going to wake up one morning in a snowdrift.",
      "I wish I could afford a decent isolated shack in the woods.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d I insist.",
      "\u201cYou worry too much.\u201d Rudy grabs a pack of cigarettes out of his back pocket, and before I can ask him not to, he lights one up and takes a deep drag. I\u2019ve never known him to go more than two minutes without a smoke. \u201cYou need to learn to relax a little, Casey.\u201d",
      "You need to learn to relax a little. That was my goal when I moved out to this cabin in The Middle of Nowhere, New Hampshire. I wanted peace and quiet, which is exactly what I got. Even with all the chirping birds and crickets and woodpeckers, it\u2019s so quiet that I\u2019ve got no distractions from thinking about the complete mess I made of my life.",
      "I came out here after I lost my teaching job. I had this idea about living off the grid for a little while, but then I discovered what living \u201coff the grid\u201d actually meant. As much as I enjoy roughing it a bit, I very much did not want to build my own septic system. So here I am, not living off the grid \u2014 I have electricity, running hot and cold water, and a working landline telephone \u2014 but I do not have a television, and I look back with disdain on the days when my smartphone was glued to my right hand. I sold the phone before I came out here.",
      "Living off the grid is great. As long as you can still use the toilet. Oh, and you definitely need a roof.",
      "I grit my teeth. \u201cI want my roof fixed, Rudy.\u201d",
      "I wish I were anywhere else but here. I especially wish I were back in Boston, in front of my classroom. I miss my students. I would have done anything for those kids.",
      "Except that\u2019s what got me into trouble.",
      "\u201cJust hold your horses, little lady,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t fix the roof now. That storm is coming.\u201d",
      "I clench my fists. I know there\u2019s a thunderstorm coming tonight. There will be buckets of rain and winds strong enough that I\u2019ll likely lose power. I\u2019ve mentioned it in every single one of my increasingly urgent phone calls to Rudy.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a clipped tone. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want you to fix it.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t got my tools,\u201d he points out. \u201cOr a ladder.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy the hell not? I told you my roof needed to be fixed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had to check it out first, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Rudy takes another drag from his cigarette. \u201cI\u2019ll fix it when the storm is over, okay? Next week.\u201d",
      "He doesn\u2019t give me a specific day or time, which is par for the course. Undoubtedly, he\u2019ll call me with an hour\u2019s notice, and if I happen to be out, then my roof just won\u2019t get fixed that day. I\u2019ll have to annoy him as much as I can to make sure this gets done.",
      "\u201cAnd one other thing\u2026\u201d I add.",
      "Rudy grunts impatiently. \u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d",
      "I shoot him a look. On a scale of one to 10, Rudy gets a two on the landlord scale. Not only does he never answer my messages, but he refuses to believe there\u2019s a problem with anything. When the refrigerator randomly stopped working a few months ago, his response was, Well, it was working when you moved in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried about that tree,\u201d I tell him.",
      "Rudy cocks his head in the direction I\u2019m pointing, at the tree on the edge of my property. I don\u2019t know what kind of tree it is, but the trunk is wider than three of me, and it towers over the cabin.",
      "\u201cAnd why are you worried about the tree?\u201d he asks me in a patronizing voice.",
      "I stomp over to the culprit in my waterproof boots and press my palm against its bark. In response to the pressure, the tree groans threateningly and shifts over about two inches.",
      "Rudy frowns. \u201cSo?\u201d",
      "\u201cSo trees aren\u2019t supposed to move like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes they do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo, Rudy. They are inanimate.\u201d",
      "He takes a long drag from his cigarette, then blows out a giant cloud of smoke. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll call a landscaper. Happy?\u201d",
      "No. I\u2019ll be happy when the tree is gone. I\u2019ve been worried about it for the last month, and now that a storm is coming, I\u2019m really worried.",
      "I look up at the roof of my house. It will probably hold. And the tree probably won\u2019t fall down. I probably won\u2019t die tonight.",
      "And if I do, the good news is that nobody will miss me."

The song was accompanied by a video featuring Fabio. Sobule\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d was a different song altogether from Katy Perry\u2019s smash 2008 song of the same name.",

      "The 2025 Met Gala will be an extravagant event \u2014\u00a0as it always is. Stars will come dressed to the nines (and 10s) on fashion's biggest night.",
      "The theme for this year is \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d which celebrates the concept of Black dandyism.",
      "In a press release, the Met said the theme was inspired by Barnard College chair and professor Monica L. Miller\u2019s 2009 book called \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\u201d",
      "The museum also said the dress code, \u201cTailored For You,\u201d is \u201ca nod to the exhibition\u2019s focus on suiting and menswear.\u201d",
      "According to Vogue, this will be the first time since 2003 that the gala will feature predominantly menswear at the gala.",
      "When is the 2025 Met Gala?",
      "The 2025 Met Gala will take place at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, May 5.",
      "How is the date chosen?",
      "The Met Gala is typically held on the first Monday in May in New York \u2014 but the tradition is relatively new, compared to the event's history.",
      "The Costume Institute\u2019s first fundraiser was held in 1948 in the fall. Until 2001, the Met Gala was held in November or December.",
      "From 2002 to 2004, the party was in April. Then came 2005. The \"Celebrating\u00a0Chanel\"-themed event was first time the Met Gala was held the first Monday of May.",
      "Since then, it's been a tradition, enough so that a documentary about the Met Gala was entitled \"The First Monday in May.\" This means next year's Met Gala will be on May 4, May 3 in 2027 and May 1 in 2028.",
      "Though the Met Gala is not always in May. In 2021, the celebration was moved to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

      "In 2010, a flotilla on a similar mission was stopped and boarded by Israeli troops near the coast of Gaza. Israeli forces' use of force resulted in the deaths of nine people on board and multiple others were wounded, a panel established by the U.N. secretary general said.",
      "Since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terrorist attacks, more\u00a0than 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, whose numbers are described as reliable by the World Health Organization.",

      "While Israel is obligated to meet the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza under its control under international humanitarian law, the U.N.-run World Food Programme last week said it had run out of food in its warehouses in Gaza and warned of mass starvation in the besieged enclave that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.",

      "Since Assad was ousted in December, Israel has seized ground in the southwest, vowed to protect the Druze, lobbied Washington to keep the neighboring state weak, and has blown up much of the Syrian army\u2019s heavy weapons in the days after he was toppled.",
      "Sharaa, who was an Al Qaeda commander before renouncing ties to the group in 2016, has repeatedly vowed to govern Syria in an inclusive way. But incidents of sectarian violence, including the\u00a0killing of hundreds of Alawites in March, have hardened fears among minority groups about the now dominant Islamists.",

    "story": [
      "Before this week's federal election in Canada, Derek Ouellette and his wife, Yecenia Ouellette, could never have imagined voting for anyone but a Conservative.",
      "\u201cWe were both raised Conservative and we both kind of thought, Conservative is just what you do,\u201d Derek Ouellette, a 46-year-old insurance broker from Belle River, near Windsor, Ontario, said in a phone interview late Tuesday.",
      "But Ouellette said he was proud to have done the once unthinkable, voting for Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is projected to have secured a minority victory in this week's poll.",
      "Across social media, a number of once-dedicated Conservatives said that they would be casting their ballots for the Liberal Party this week for the first time in their lives. Many described their vote as a rejection of \"Canada's Trump\" \u2014 Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 and his aggressive campaign, which experts say appeared to pull from the playbook of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThere were some elements of his campaign that echoed Trump,\u201d Roland Paris, director of the University of Ottawa\u2019s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, said Wednesday.",
      "That included talking \u201cabout eliminating wokeism\u201d and \u201creferring to his political opponents with nasty nicknames,\u201d Paris added. \u201cNone of these features of his campaign helped him once Trump came to be seen by many Canadians as an enemy of Canada.\u201d",
      "Just weeks ago, the pugnacious approach of Poilievre, who had previously allied himself with the so-called Freedom Convoy that protested vaccine mandates for truck drivers, appeared to be working.",
      "His campaign, during which he focused on small-government and libertarian issues, combined with dissatisfaction at the scandal-hit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's handling of the economy to see the Conservatives move 24 points ahead of the Liberals in January, according to a poll tracker run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "But within a matter of weeks, everything changed: Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, while Trump swept back to power in the U.S., threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada as the \u201c51st state,\u201d before imposing sweeping 25% tariffs on goods from America\u2019s northern neighbor and sparking outrage across the country.",
      "Trump's bellicose remarks gave a huge boost to Canadian nationalism, with many vowing to boycott the U.S. and its products.",
      "As anti-Trump sentiment grew across Canada, Poilievre's own bullish rhetoric rapidly lost its sheen for many Canadian Conservatives.",
      "When Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, was named Canada\u2019s interim prime minister and the Liberal candidate for the 2025 election, distaste for Trudeau and worries about the Liberals' ability to handle the economy quickly evaporated.",
      "When it did, a new way forward emerged for those who had felt politically homeless.",
      "Poilievre, now the former leader of the opposition, even lost the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades to a Liberal neophyte Monday.",
      "'Maple MAGA'",
      "\u201cListening to Poilievre speak, it\u2019s like talking points from Trump,\u201d Ouellette said. \u201cIt just reeks of what\u2019s happening south of the border.\u201d",
      "By comparison, he added, Carney \u201chas shown himself to be very decisive in dealing with Trump\u201d by billing himself as candidate who could stand up to the president.",
      "\u201cI just cannot support the hate rhetoric ... and this \u2018Maple MAGA\u2019 movement that\u2019s happening here in Canada,\u201d said Chantal Dugdale, 57, another Conservative who voted Liberal for the first time in her life Monday.",
      "Dugdale said she found parallels between Poilievre\u2019s campaign and support base, and Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement particularly off-putting.",
      "\u201cWe need unity. We need to be together. We need positive messaging,\u201d said Dugdale, who is from Barrie, just north of Toronto, and works in marketing and sales.",
      "Trump appeared aware of his likely impact on Canada\u2019s election, saying in an interview conducted last week and published Monday by The Atlantic that until he \u201ccame along, remember, that the Conservative was leading.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I was disliked by enough of the Canadians that I\u2019ve thrown the election into a close call, right?\u201d he said.",
      "A close call indeed, with Ouellette, Dugdale and political experts noting that Carney\u2019s victory was far from a landslide, with the next Liberal government projected to fall short of winning the majority of seats in Parliament.",
      "And while lifelong Conservatives may have helped propel the Liberal leader forward, Paris said he believed \u201cMark Carney would likely not have won if not for Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cCanadians were tired of the Liberal Party after 10 years, but they were even more concerned about Trump\u2019s threats,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Dugdale pointed out, the election\u2019s projected outcome was a far cry from the Conservative victory that felt increasingly certain just weeks ago, with Poilievre now out of a job.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so ironic. Paul [Poilievre] was shouting, \u2018we need change,\u2019\u201d Dugdale said. \u201cHe got change alright.\u201d"

He added artificial white doves to the arrangement, saying they were in honor of the late Pope Francis, who had led a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a testament that God is alive,\u201d Concepcion, a devout Catholic who works as a street vendor, told NBC News. \u201cHe accepted everyone, including us gay people who have long been marginalized.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 death on April 21 has opened the eternal tension between choosing a successor that represents continuity, or one who will bring change, including a possible return to the church\u2019s recent past of more conservative positions on issues like homosexuality.",
      "Luis Antonio Tagle, a Filipino cardinal often dubbed the \u201cAsian Francis\u201d for his emphasis on poor and marginalized people, has emerged as a possible leading contender, or papabile, when the conclave meets on May 7 to elect Francis\u2019 replacement.",
      "If chosen as pope, Tagle could carry with him some lessons from the Philippines. Despite being the biggest Catholic nation in Asia \u2014 about 80% of Filipinos are Catholic \u2014 and the third-largest in the world, it is also one of the more LGBTQ-friendly countries in the region.",
      "Many gay Catholics, like Concepcion, remain active and visible members of the church, and he says Tagle offers the possibility of continuing Francis\u2019 embrace of gay Catholics into the next papacy.",
      "\u201cBeing gay is not wrong because we were also created by God and all things that God created are beautiful,\u201d Concepcion added.",
      "The Philippine Catholic Church has become more open to gay Catholics in recent years, including in a 2024 position paper in which the church acknowledged the LGBTQ community\u2019s \u201cimportant role in the life of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.\u201d",
      "And while Tagle, who is known for avoiding provocative rhetoric and controversial issues, has rarely spoken publicly about homosexuality in his statements and homilies, he has lamented the church\u2019s \u201charsh words\u201d in the past about gay and divorced people. Filipino Catholics say they have felt supported by some of his actions and see them as potential signs of his approach to the community if he were to be elected pope.",
      "Edwin Valles, former president of Courage Philippines, an LGBTQ organization under the Archdiocese of Manila, says he is certain that Tagle would continue embracing the gay community.",
      "In 2014, Valles said he approached Tagle, then head of the Archdiocese of Manila, to request a priest to be assigned to guide their members, a request Tagle granted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a commitment on his part,\u201d Valles said. \u201cHe puts money where his mouth is. So I like to think that he will also do the same if and when he becomes pope.\u201d",
      "Valles tells a story from a 2018 event they both attended, when a young faithful asked the cardinal about the status of LGBTQ Catholics.",
      "\u201cAnd his answer was something like: All of us are Catholics, all of us are parishioners, all of us are children of God. So why make that label and distinction? That just serves to separate or put people in boxes,\u201d Valles recalled Tagle saying.",
      "A man of the people",
      "The Jesuit-educated Tagle, 67, was born to a Filipino father and a Filipino Chinese mother who were both bankers, and Tagle grew up in a well-to-do family. He was ordained as a priest in 1982 at the age of 24, and like Francis, adopted a simple life.",
      "From 2001 to 2011, he served as the Bishop of the Diocese of Imus, a city south of Manila, and his hometown. There, Tagle took to walking the streets, greeting street vendors and motorcycle taxi drivers. Residents affectionately recalled how Tagle would sit on a wooden bench outside a humble neighborhood barbershop, Bible in hand, his presence so regular that it earned Roland, the shopkeeper, the nickname, \u201cHoly Barber.\u201d",
      "Tagle then became Manila\u2019s archbishop in 2011 and was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. In 2015, he was elected president of Caritas Internationalis, the humanitarian and development organization of the Catholic Church, and was reelected again in 2019. That year, he moved to the Vatican after Francis appointed him head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, the Church\u2019s missionary arm.",
      "He would fly back to the Philippines, unannounced and without fanfare, to check on his ailing parents, have his hair cut by Roland, and make surprise visits to neighbors and relatives eager to receive a blessing from a cardinal back home from the Vatican.",
      "He \u201cdoes not possess a prophetic voice\u201d",
      "Tagle is highly respected in the Philippines, where he is widely perceived as \u201cwarm, gentle, approachable, humble, and at times funny,\u201d just like Francis, Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from the University of Santo Tomas, a Catholic university in Manila, told NBC News.",
      "As a top cleric, Tagle\u2019s pastoral approach \u201creflects a leader eager to serve and emphasize meeting the needs of his flock,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "But the similarities seemed to end there. Unlike Francis who spoke with forceful, moral authority on worldly issues like exploitative capitalism or the injustices of war, Asiones said, Tagle \u201clacks or does not possess a prophetic voice.\u201d",
      "Tagle has been criticized for his inaction on sexual abuse by priests, and his silence on the extrajudicial killings ordered by the Philippines' former president Rodrigo Duterte, in a crackdown on drugs that left tens of thousands, including children, dead. Duterte openly attacked and threatened the Church which, in the Philippines, has historically stood up against political power.",
      "In the face of the flagrant human rights abuses, however, Tagle responded with statements Duterte's opponents criticized as vague and unchallenging.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Tagle will be entirely Francis 2.0. For one, he opts for political correctness, often avoiding confrontational language, and seems reticent, if not afraid, to hold truth to power,\u201d Asiones said.",
      "A good theologian, but a poor administrator",
      "Tagle has had significant experience in the Vatican, but observers say it has been far from stellar.",
      "In 2022, Francis dismissed Tagle and the rest of the leadership team of Caritas Internationalis after a Vatican-led audit found \u201creal deficiencies\u201d in management and procedures.",
      "What the Roman Curia needs is a pope who is also a good administrator, said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, an international publication focusing on the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cTagle is considered intelligent, a good theologian, and a good communicator. But in many ways he has not been a very good administrator in some of the jobs he\u2019s had in the Vatican,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHe has not proven himself in that role.\u201d",
      "Francis had shaken things up in the Vatican and the Cardinals may look to someone who could provide stability to replace him.",

      "But far from the\u00a0Sistine Chapel\u00a0where\u00a0cloistered cardinals\u00a0will cast votes, people are placing bets on who will be chosen as the next pope. From cash bets on websites to online games modeled after\u00a0fantasy football leagues\u00a0and casual wagers among friends and families, the popularity of guessing and gambling on the future of the papacy is increasing worldwide, experts and participants say.",
      "It\u2019s even topped the Europa League soccer tournament and Formula One drivers\u2019 championship, said Sam Eaton, U.K. manager for Oddschecker, a leading online platform analyzing odds across sports, events and other betting markets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge level of interest globally,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a market like this where we\u2019ve had so many countries interested in seeing odds.\u201d",
      "Around the world, thousands of bets on the next pope",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people from some 140 countries have visited Oddschecker to review each cardinal\u2019s chances of becoming the next pope, Eaton said. He noted special eagerness in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.",
      "In the U.K., about 30,000 pounds (almost $40,000) have been wagered with one leading online betting platform as of this week, Eaton said \u2014 a far cry from 1.2 million pounds on the singing contest Eurovision but still noteworthy as a trend, with the conclave days away.",
      "\u201cBetting on the next pope is definitely a niche market in the grand scheme of things, but it generates global interest,\u201d said Lee Phelps, a spokesman for William Hill, one of the U.K.\u2019s biggest bookmakers.",

      "Betting on elections, papal conclaves and all manner of global events is almost a tradition of its own in the U.K., but such betting is not legal in the United States. BetMGM, one of the world\u2019s top sports-betting companies, said it would not have any bets up.",

      "Some people in Rome are making friendly, informal wagers \u2014 the equivalent of $20 on a favorite cardinal, with the loser pledging to host a dinner or buy a pizza night out.",
      "Others are turning to an online game called Fantapapa, or Fantasy Pope, which mimics popular fantasy football and soccer leagues. More than 60,000 people are playing, each choosing 11\u00a0cardinals\u00a0\u2014 as if for a soccer team \u2014 whom they believe have the best shot at becoming the next pope.",
      "They also draft the\u00a0top contender, or captain. As with online wagers, the No. 1 choice for fantasy players has been Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, closely followed by Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really fun game to play with friends and have a laugh,\u201d Italian student Federico La Rocca, 23, said. \u201cInitially my dad sent it to me ironically, but now that it\u2019s going to be the conclave, I decided to have a go and try it.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt seems like in Italy there\u2019s a certain inquisitiveness about the mechanisms of the Catholic hierarchy, but it\u2019s a critical curiosity, a sarcastic and playful curiosity, so we were interested in this jesting spirit for such a solemn event,\u201d Vanetti said. \u201cIn some ways it deflates the sacredness, in a nonaggressive way.\u201d",
      "Some concerns about betting on a solemn event",
      "Beyond simply picking who the next pope will be, players and gamblers also can guess how many tries it will take the cardinals to choose the leader, which day of the week he\u2019ll be elected, what new name he will decide on, or where his priorities will land on the progressive-conservative scale.",
      "While the game and some of the bets have a novel or fun nature, anti-gambling advocates have raised overall concerns about legal gaming and the growing popularity of wagering on all manner of events.",
      "A study published last fall found that 10% of young men in the U.S. show behavior that indicates a\u00a0gambling problem, which is a\u00a0rising concern in other parts of the world, too.",
      "And for gambling around the papacy in general, some have raised religious concerns. Catholic teaching doesn\u2019t go so far as to call games of chance or wagers sinful, but its Catechism warns that \u201cthe passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement.\u201d",
      "It says gambling becomes \u201cmorally unacceptable\u201d if it gravely affects a person\u2019s livelihood."

    "story": [
      "SINGAPORE \u2014 Singapore\u2019s long-ruling People\u2019s Action Party won another landslide in Saturday\u2019s general elections, extending its 66-year unbroken rule in a huge boost for Prime Minister Lawrence Wong who took power a year ago.",
      "The Election Department announced the PAP won 82 Parliamentary seats after vote counting ended. The party had earlier won five seats uncontested, giving it 87 out of a total 97 seats. The opposition Workers Party maintained its 10 seats.",
      "The PAP\u2019s popular vote rose to 65.6%, up from a near-record low of 61% in 2020 polls. Jubilant supporters of the PAP, which had ruled Singapore since 1959, gathered in stadiums waved flags and cheered in celebration.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful once again for your strong mandate. We will honor the trust you have given to us by working even harder for all of you,\u201d Wong said in a speech earlier to his constituency before the full results were out.",
      "Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University, said the opposition\u2019s failure to make further inroads after 2020 was a surprise. \u201cSingapore voters played their cards close to their chest. Today, they indicated that their trust is with a party that has delivered over the years,\u201d he said.",
      "A U.S.-trained economist who is also finance minister, Wong\u2019s appeal for a resounding mandate to steer trade-reliant Singapore through economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes has hit home. The government has lowered its growth forecast and warned of a possible recession.",
      "Wong, 52, succeeded Lee Hsien Loong to become the city-state\u2019s fourth leader. Lee stepped down in May 2024 after two decades at the helm but remained in the Cabinet as a senior minister. His retirement as premier ended a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore\u2019s first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world\u2019s richest nations during 31 years in office.",
      "The PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity, but tight government control and the rising cost of living in one of the world\u2019s most expensive cities also has led to growing unhappiness, especially among younger voters. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding and restrictions on free speech have loosened the PAP\u2019s grip on power.",
      "The opposition says giving it a stronger presence in Parliament will allow a more balanced political system and greater accountability. But they face an uphill task, often hamstrung by a lack of resources, fragmented support and a lack of unity. Critics said gerrymandering also gives the PAP an advantage.",
      "Pritam Singh, leader of the Workers Party, acknowledged it was a tough contest and vowed to continue the fight for a more balanced Parliament. \u201cThe slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again,\u201d he said.",
      "While the Workers Party failed to expand its presence, it had consolidated its support with increased share vote in some areas, said Southeast Asia political analyst Bridget Welsh. Other smaller opposition parties however, failed to make a breakthrough.",
      "Welsh said voters opted for stability amid concerns over global volatility due to sweeping U.S. tariffs. Wong\u2019s more approachable leadership in engaging yunger voters and efforts to renew PAP by bringing in about a-third of new faces also helped swung votes, she said.",
      "\u201cI call this the Wong and Trump effect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue of economic insecurity really did reinforce his mandate.\u201d"

      "Weidel has been able to harness a nationalist, anti-E.U sentiment along with hostilities against Muslims and foreigners, to build a stronghold for the party in the regions that once made up East Germany, where skepticism for NATO and Germany's support for Ukraine are among the strongest in the country.",
      "Vance, and Musk followed Rubio in his criticism, with the Vice President saying the AfD was the \"most popular party in Germany and by far the most representative of East Germany.\"",

      "The Labor Party pulled ahead of the\u00a0conservative Liberal-National coalition, led by Peter Dutton, with the Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s early projections suggesting at least 70\u00a0of the 150 House seats for Labor, according to the Australian broadcaster ABC.",
      "\u201cNot the night we wanted,\u201d Dutton said at his party headquarters, adding that he had congratulated Albanese on his win.",
      "Independent candidates and minor parties are projected to take about 13 seats in parliament, which means Albanese may have to form a coalition if the final count shows that his party ultimately falls short of a parliamentary majority.",
      "Concerns among Australians over the soaring cost of living and the lack of affordable housing dominated the election at a time when interest rates remain high. Geopolitical relations with China, Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, were also front of mind for voters.",
      "But voters in this election were more concerned by Trump\u2019s shake-up of the global order with a new trade regime that slapped a 10% tariff on all Australian exports to the U.S.",
      "A survey published Wednesday by Australian think tank the Lowy Institute found that over 60% of Australians did not have any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly.",
      "Albanese, 62, rose to the top job in 2022, ending nine years of conservative rule. Spotlighting his working-class credentials, his party in this election promised\u00a0tax cuts,\u00a0help for young homebuyers, and a pledge of $5.5 billion more for health care.",
      "Until recently, the Australian leader\u00a0faced the prospect of becoming the country\u2019s first single-term prime minister in almost a century, bogged down by high inflation, a slowing economy, and a housing crisis put into sharp relief by Albanese\u2019s ill-timed purchase of a multimillion-dollar cliff-top home.",
      "After Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Dutton, 54, who was leading the polls against his rival Albanese, saw a turnaround in popularity after many of his party\u2019s campaign promises, including on immigration, were seen as widely emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "In the lead-up to the election, Liberal Party insiders told Reuters that the anti-Trump sentiment was spurring risk-averse voters to move away from Dutton at the ballot box.",
      "Trump had been \u201ca wrecking ball\u201d for Australia\u2019s conservative coalition, said Andrew Carswell, the former press secretary to Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who lost office in the previous\u00a0election, according to Reuters.",
      "Albanese, meanwhile, refrained from mentioning Trump on the campaign trail, instead telling voters on Monday, \u201cThe last thing you need is a volatile government.\u201d",
      "He has avoided direct criticism of the president in favor of a security alliance with the U.S., though he was notably absent from Trump\u2019s inauguration and has yet to visit Washington.",
      "A YouGov poll released on Thursday predicted a Labor majority, saying the party would likely win up to\u00a085 seats\u00a0in the 150-seat lower house, with the opposition facing a net loss of 11 seats, which would be its worst performance since 1946.",
      "Albanese\u2019s win comes after Canada\u2019s election earlier this week saw Prime Minister Mark Carney stage a major political comeback, fueled by a backlash against Trump\u2019s comments on making Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Australia is one of a few countries where voting is compulsory for all citizens ages 18 years and older. Around 4.8 million of 18 million eligible voters began casting their votes as early as Thursday, with most postal votes expected to be counted after\u00a0election\u00a0day."

    "published": "Fri, 02 May 2025 06:33:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is at the center of a national election in Australia, where support for conservatives has dropped among voters angered by U.S. policies.",
    "story": [
      "Days after a Canadian election that hinged on who would best stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump, he is at the center of an election in another liberal democracy.",
      "Trust in the United States is plummeting in Australia, which votes Saturday amid global financial turmoil sparked by tariffs Trump has imposed on trading partners around the world including Australia, a U.S. ally and vital security partner in countering China.",
      "As in Canada, Australia\u2019s opposition conservative party, the Coalition, was primed to win before Trump returned to office, thanks to public anger over the cost of living and record-high home prices. But it has since lost support among voters increasingly concerned about how their government will handle Trump.",
      "On Thursday, two polls showed the Coalition trailing the center-left Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "His opponent, Peter Dutton, has pushed pushed\u00a0the Liberal party \u2014 the larger of the two parties that make up the conservative Coalition\u00a0\u2013 further to the right since becoming party leader in 2022.",
      "His nods to Trump include pledging to slash 41,000 public service jobs, proposing to reduce legal migration to Australia and appointing a shadow minister for government efficiency, prompting his opponents to call him \u201cDOGE-y Dutton.\u201d",
      "Though Dutton says he\u2019s his \u201cown person,\u201d his association with Trump appears to have become a liability among Australian voters, said John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University.",
      "\u201cDutton, perhaps overenthusiastically, endorsed President Trump\u2019s victory without recognizing how difficult that would make his position \u2014 not with the bolted-on right, but with the swing voters, the center of the center, where all elections are won in Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "A poll released last month by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36% of Australians expressed any level of trust in the United States \u2014 the lowest in the annual poll\u2019s two-decade history.",
      "Blaxland described Trump\u2019s disregard for long-standing alliances and his quid pro quo approach to U.S. foreign policy as \u201cvertigo inducing\u201d for politicians, policymakers and voters in Australia, where voting is mandatory.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s \u201chyperrealist, short-term, transactional approach to its relationships is deeply unsettling and corrosive of goodwill,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has treated Australia as just another freeloader, slapping a 10% tariff on all exports to the U.S., even though the U.S. generally runs a trade surplus with Australia rather than a deficit. (In a rare deviation, Australia reported Thursday that it sold more to the U.S. than it bought in the first quarter as investors spooked by Trump\u2019s tariffs rushed to buy gold, one of Australia\u2019s top metals exports.)",
      "While 81% of Australians disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs, the vast majority (80%) continue to say the U.S. alliance is important for Australia\u2019s security.",
      "Those numbers reflect the economic and security dichotomy Australia faces: how to balance its security ties with the U.S. and its trade interests with China.",
      "Albanese has spent his prime ministership working to stabilize relations with China, which nosedived under the previous conservative government, prompting China to impose punishing trade restrictions.",
      "China is Australia\u2019s largest two-way trading partner, accounting for 25% of the country\u2019s goods and services trade in 2023-24. The U.S. is Australia\u2019s third-largest two-way trading partner and largest source of foreign investment.",
      "If the United States, which has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, \u201creally damages the Chinese economy, then that is going to have a major impact on Australia,\u201d said Stuart Rollo, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.",
      "Rollo said he worries Australia could be caught in the middle if the U.S. tries to pressure its allies to reduce their economic ties with Beijing.",
      "\u201cSo much of our future prosperity is tied with Chinese growth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor us to make the decision to disconnect from that \u2014 because we need American protection forever \u2014 that\u2019s going to be a real cost to the living standards of Australians moving forward.\u201d",
      "Without the U.S., however, Australia would be cut off from critical military technology and far less protected against Chinese aggression.",
      "Australia\u2019s vulnerability was on display in February when the Chinese military conducted live-fire drills off the country\u2019s coast, forcing dozens of commercial flights to reroute.",
      "That\u2019s why Australian politicians on both sides of the aisle say they remain committed to AUKUS, the security pact among Australia, the U.S. and Britain, even as Australians question whether they can still rely on the U.S. for their defense.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re this kind of Anglo, European-transplanted community sitting on the edge of Asia, and [that] drives our fear of abandonment, which drives us towards the United States,\u201d Blaxland said.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia is set to buy several nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. as a deterrent against China.",
      "But Australia would struggle to pay for those submarines without its trade relationship with China, said James Laurenceson, director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\u201cThis is a big cost problem for a small economy like Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go all in on AUKUS, all in on the United States, all in on containing China and imagine that our trade with China, which is paying for our submarines, can actually be sustained. It can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Both Albanese and Dutton have downplayed any uncertainty around U.S. relations, but Laurenceson believes cracks are emerging in bipartisan support for the alliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll say that our security alliance with the U.S. is much more than just about one administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true, but Trump is certainly challenging that.\u201d"

    "summary": "Prince Harry says he's ready to reconnect with family, but King Charles 'won't speak to me' over security funding fight",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 After losing a legal battle over his lack of publicly funded security, Prince Harry on Friday expressed a desire to rebuild his strained relationship with the Royal Family.",
      "\u201cI would love\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0with my family. ... There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people,\u201d Harry told the BBC. \u201cIt would be nice to have that\u00a0reconciliation\u00a0part now. If they don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s entirely up to them.\u201d",
      "Harry's interview with the BBC came after he lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he says has driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live. King Charles III, from whom Harry says he is currently cut off, was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "And without security, Harry said, \u201cI can\u2019t see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the U.K. at this point.\u201d",
      "Charles' second son\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. That meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "Harry, who is the fifth in line to the throne, had argued that the body responsible for protecting the Royal Family was not following its own rules, that all high-profile members of the Royal Family, like the king and his brother Prince William, have around-the-clock protection.",
      "The Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, made the decision on his security arrangements after he and Meghan stepped down from being a working member of the Royal Family in 2020. Currently, his security in the U.K. is decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country\u2019s other high-profile visitors.",
      "After the ruling Friday, a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace said \u201cAll of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\u201d",
      "In their ruling Friday, judges Lord Justice David Bean, Lord Justice Andrew Edis and Sir Geoffrey Vos dismissed his appeal.",
      "Harry \u201cwas in effect stepping in and out of the cohort of protection provided by Ravec,\u201d Sir Geoffrey Vos told the court.",
      "\u201cOutside the U.K. he was outside the cohort, but when in the U.K. his security would be considered as appropriate depending on the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was imposssible, I said in my judgement to say that this reasoning was illogical or innappropriate. Indeed it seemed sensible,\u201d he added.",
      "In an earlier written submission to the court, his legal team said that Harry \u201cinherited a security risk at birth, for life.\u201d It added that he \u201cserved two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "Harry and his wife felt \u201cforced to step back\u201d from their roles \u201cas they considered they were not being protected by the institution,\u201d it said.",
      "Harry has said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which he has said are racially motivated.",
      "Rejecting his challenge in February 2024, Britain\u2019s High Court said the decision to change Harry\u2019s security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Two months later he lost the right to appeal the ruling, although that was later overturned.",
      "Harry failed to persuade a different judge last year that he should be able to privately pay for London\u2019s Metropolitan Police force to guard him while he is in the U.K. after a government lawyer argued that officers shouldn\u2019t be used as \u201cprivate bodyguards for the wealthy.\u201d",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s company, News Group Newspapers, agreed to pay \u201csubstantial damages\u201d to Harry after settling a long-running legal battle. NGN admitted that between 1996 and 2011, staff on The Sun newspapers used unlawful methods to dig up private information about Harry and his late mother, Princess Diana.",
      "The duke is also among a group of celebrities suing another publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), which prints the Daily Mail, accusing it of lawbreaking in its attempts to gather information on them. The trial is due to start next year.",
      "In 2023, he dropped a libel case against ANL for its coverage of his legal battle over personal security. And the same year, he was awarded 140,600 pounds ($179,350) after successfully bringing a phone-hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers."

      "The Trump administration has designated a coalition of Haitian gangs that have embroiled the Caribbean nation in mass violence as terrorist organizations, a White House official confirmed to NBC News.",
      "The Viv Ansanm coalition and the Gran Grif gang will now be labeled a Foreign Terrorist Organizations and as Specifically Designated Global Terrorists by the State Department.",
      "The designation was first reported by the Miami Herald.",
      "The Treasury Department also applied the designation to the Gran Grif gang. In October, the gang took responsibility for a massacre of at least 115 people in Pont-Sonde, a rural town.",
      "Earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio authorized a similar designation for several Mexican cartels and gangs, including MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, according to which, if an individual is found to be providing \u201cmaterial support\u201d to them, they could face sanctions and penalties.",
      "\"Engaging in transactions with members of these groups entails risk in relation to counterterrorism sanctions authorities, not only for Haitians but also for U.S. lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens,\" Rubio said in a statement on Friday. \"Individuals and entities providing material support\u00a0or resources to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges and inadmissibility or removal from the United States.\"",
      "The terrorist designation for Tren de Aragua and MS-13 has been used as one determining factor in deporting several people in the U.S. to a Salvadorian prison. The move comes as thousands of Haitians living in the U.S. under protected status programs were told they must leave the country months before their status was set to expire.",
      "According to a fact sheet by the State Department, Gran Grif is the largest gang in Haiti's rural Artibonite region. The department said the gang is responsible for 80% of the deaths in that area, including an attack earlier this year that killed a Kenyan military officer on a mission to provide security in Haiti.",
      "Viv Ansanm is a coalition of gangs especially concentrated in Port-au-Prince, where most of the violence has centralized since 2021. According to the State Department, this group coordinated the attacks that have destabilized critical infrastructure, including prisons, government buildings and the main airport.",
      "Rubio told the Herald that the designation was part of America\u2019s responsibility to address the widespread violence and political upheaval in the country.\u00a0The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "In anticipation of the designation, Democratic representatives Gregory Meeks of New York and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida, sent a letter to Rubio sharing their problems with the plan.",
      "\"While we support efforts to target the financial support of violent gangs wreaking havoc on innocent Haitians,\" they wrote on April 30, \"we are concerned that an FTO designation, absent a clear, comprehensive U.S. strategy to defeat the gangs and their enablers, is counterproductive and will only exacerbate Haitians\u2019 suffering.\"",
      "Guerline Jozef, the executive director of Haitian Bridge Alliance, said the designation \"would not weaken the gangs \u2014 it would criminalize survivors, block humanitarian aid, and escalate deportations and target of people of Haitian descent fleeing for their lives. We must address the flow of guns and armed groups in Haiti while pursuing lawful, effective tools\u2014not political theater.\u201d",
      "In addition to potentially cracking down on anyone in the U.S. who sends cash to people in Haiti, Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is monitoring the situation in the country, said the designation may have more of a social effect on Haitians living here.",
      "More than 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict as the violence has spread to central Haiti. The instability throughout the country has forced health facilities to close and has caused widespread famine.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic and other countries have been deporting Haitian migrants back to their home country despite pleas from the United Nations to stand down over humanitarian concerns, according to Reuters."

      "Andy Le \u2014 the 16-year-old whose stepmother and father were also killed in the deadly attack on the Filipino festival last weekend \u2014 announced in a video released this week that he is giving away more than $266,000 Canadian dollars from a fundraiser set up for him. It had raised over half a million Canadian dollars as of its close on Tuesday.",

      "The Saturday attack killed 11 people and injured more than two dozen others. The victims ranged in age from 5 to 65, officials said at a news conference Sunday, adding that the death toll could rise.

      "Officials said the suspect, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, 30, who has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, had a history of mental illness and was known to police. Lo was under the care of a mental health team at Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), the facility said in a statement Tuesday. But he was on an extended leave under the Mental Health Act at the time of the attack.",
      "Toan Le told NBC News that his brother, Richard Le, 47; his sister-in-law, Linh Hoang, 30; and his niece, Katie Le, 5, were killed. Andy Le survived, the GoFundMe said, because he opted to stay home to finish his homework instead of attending the festival with the rest of his family.",
      "The fundraiser was initially started to pay for Andy Le\u2019s college education in addition to final expenses for his three family members. In a post on the GoFundMe page, Toan Le said that the funds would now also go toward direct or indirect victims and cover expenses including funeral costs, education, counseling and medical expenses.",

      "In his video, Andy Le said that he plans to continue living with his grandparents.",
      "Locals previously told NBC News that the festival that was attacked is one of the largest Filipino celebrations of the year. It honors the 16th century Filipino chieftain Datu Lapu-Lapu, who defeated Spanish forces and remains a symbol of resistance against colonialism.",
      "Diana Silva, a vendor at the festival who left just 30 minutes before the attack, said that during a vigil for the victims, community members didn\u2019t hesitate to start brainstorming ways to support survivors and help grieving community members.\u201d Silva said it was reflective of the spirit of the chieftain himself.",
      "\u201cLapu-Lapu is all about resilience, and he stood up for the Philippines,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what our community is doing now.\u201d"
