      "\u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d have debuted in theaters with a combined $270 million in ticket sales",
      "NEW YORK -- With a combined $270 million in worldwide ticket sales, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d breathed fresh life into a box office that has struggled lately, leading to one of the busiest moviegoing weekends of the year.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish big-budget musical \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, debuted with $114 million domestically and $164.2 million globally for Universal Pictures, according to studio estimates Sunday. That made it the third-biggest opening weekend of the year, behind only \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a record for a Broadway musical adaptation.",
      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Colosseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint also was notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2014 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 also were higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2014 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2014 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film. In its second week of release, the Amazon MGM Studios release grossed $13.3 million to bring its two-week global haul to $117 million. At a cost of $250 million to make, \u201cRed One\u201d is the season's biggest flop, though it could recoup some value for Amazon if it's more popular once it begins streaming.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \"Wicked,\" $114 million.",
      "2. \u201cGladiator II,\u201d $55.5 million.",
      "3. \u201cRed One,\u201d $13.3 million.",
      "4. \u201cBonhoeffer: Pastor Spy Assassin,\" $5.1 million.",

      "Best-selling author Barbara Taylor Bradford has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Barbara Taylor Bradford, a British journalist who became a publishing sensation in her 40s with the saga \"A Woman of Substance\" and wrote more than a dozen other novels that sold tens of millions of copies, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bradford died Sunday at her home in New York City, a spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Starting with \"A Woman of Substance,\" published in 1979, Bradford averaged nearly a book a year as one of the world's most popular and wealthiest writers, her net worth estimated at more than $200 million and her fame so high that her image appeared on a postage stamp in 1999. In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II awarded her an OBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire).",
      "Her books were published in 40 languages and sold more than 90 million copies around the world.",
      "With titles like \u201cBreaking the Rules'' and \u201dAct of Will,'' she specialized in stories of women fighting for love and power in a man's world. Her favorite among her books was \"The Women In His Life,\" inspired by her husband's escape from the Nazis",
      "Bradford was married for 56 years to German-born film producer Robert Bradford, who died in 2019.",
      "A native of Leeds, West Yorkshire, she was an only child in a working class family who loved books early. As a girl, she had a story published in a local magazine. By age 16, she left school against her parents' wishes to become a reporter for the Yorkshire Evening Post. Over the next 30 years, she would work as fashion editor of Woman's Own Magazine, cover a variety of beats for the London Evening News and, in the United States, write a syndicated column about interior design.",
      "Although she wrote children's stories and advice books, novels were her dream. \"A Woman of Substance\" was a multi-generational chronicle of the travails and triumphs of retail baron Emma Harte, who would be featured in several other Bradford novels. The book has sold more than 30 million copies and was the basis of a 1984 television miniseries starring Jenny Seagrove as a young Emma and Deborah Kerr as Emma late in life.",
      "\u201cAnd if you want to meet the real Emma, meet me,\u201d Bradford told the Telegraph of London in 2009. \"Emma had to be tough and ruthless at times: but then so am I. I have to be, as a businesswoman. And I'm a bloody good businesswoman.\"",
      "Bradford and Emma Harte were linked by more than money: both had family secrets. As a young woman, Emma became pregnant by a man who refused to marry her and gave birth to a daughter. Years later, Bradford learned through her biographer that her own mother had been born out of wedlock. It is now believed that Bradford\u2019s maternal grandfather was Frederick Oliver Robinson, the second Marquess of Ripon and owner of the Studley Royal estate in Yorkshire, which is now a World Heritage Site.",
      "Seagrove, who became friends with Bradford after starring in the miniseries, described her as a \u201cpowerhouse of glamour and warmth\u201d and a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who stayed true to her roots.",
      "\u201cSuccess never diluted her warmth and humor or her ability to relate to everyone she met, whether a cleaner or a princess,\u201d Seagrove said. \"She never, ever forgot that she was just a girl from Yorkshire that worked hard and made good. RIP dear friend.\u201d",
      "Bradford had a strict writing routine: at work behind her IBM Lexmark typewriter by 6 a.m., break around 1 p.m., then back to writing until 6 p.m., at the latest. According to an authorized 2006 biography, Piers Dudgeon's \"The Woman of Substance,\" Bradford more than adapted to her midlife fortune, living in a 5,300 square foot apartment overlooking Manhattan's East River, collecting Impressionist art and enjoying refills of pink champagne poured by her Moroccan butler. When the Bradfords put their apartment up for sale in 2010, the asking price was just under $19 million. (They sold it to Uma Thurman in 2013 for $10 million).",
      "Over the years, she met many other celebrities. Bradford befriended Sean Connery before he appeared in his first James Bond movie and remembered advising him, thankfully in vain, that he should lose his Scottish accent if he wanted to succeed.",
      "Around the same time, she met a fellow journalist at the Yorkshire Evening Post. He was \u201clanky and disheveled with acne,\u201d and kept trying to talk to her even after she turned him down for a date at the movies.",
      "He was Peter O'Toole.",
      "\"Years later, (Evening Post editor) Keith Waterhouse and I were at an event where the producer Sam Spiegel introduced the star of his new movie,\" she told The Guardian in 2021. \u201cOut walked the most beautiful man I\u2019d ever seen, dressed as Lawrence of Arabia. Keith said: \u2018Don\u2019t you wish you\u2019d gone to the pictures with him now?\u2019 I never got over Peter\u2019s transformation.\u201d"

      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV\u2019s \u201cLove Connection,\u201d for which he coined the phrase, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\u201d a two-fingered signature dubbed the \u201c2 and 2.\u201d In 1984, he hosted TV\u2019s \u201cScrabble,\u201d simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\u201cLove Connection,\u201d which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest\u2019s choice, \u201cLove Connection\u201d would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, \u2018I remember wagon trains.\u2019 The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\u201d",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \u201cLingo,\" \u201cGreed\u201d and \u201cThe Chuck Woolery Show,\u201d as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \u201cThe Dating Game\u201d from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV\u2019s \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network\u2019s first attempt at a reality show, \u201cChuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\u201d which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d debuted Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d started life as \u201cShopper\u2019s Bazaar,\u201d incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show\u201d singing \u201cDelta Dawn,\u201d Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\u201cI had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\u201d Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \u201cAfter the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, \u2018Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn\u2019t care what you have to say \u2014 that\u2019s the guy I want to be.\u2019\u201d",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \u201cHollywood Squares.\u201d Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\u201cBoth Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and \u2018Wheel\u2019 did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019 achieved in its heyday,\u201d Griffin said in \u201cMerv: Making the Good Life Last,\u201d an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which tourbed in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \u201cNaturally Stoned,\u201d with Woolery singing, \u201cWhen I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I\u2019m naturally stoned.\u201d",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \u201cI\u2019ve Been Wrong\u201d in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \u201cForgive My Heart\u201d and \u201cLove Me, Love Me.\u201d",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette\u2019s 1971 album \u201cWe Sure Can Love Each Other,\u201d Woolery wrote \u201cThe Joys of Being a Woman\u201d with lyrics including \u201cSee our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\u201d",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn\u2019t revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \u201cBlunt Force Truth\u201d and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don\u2019t need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\u201d he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \u201cImpeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\u201d",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump\u2019s chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\u201cThe most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it\u2019s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I\u2019m sick of it,\u201d Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",

      "Breytenbach was a celebrated wordsmith, a leading voice in literature in Afrikaans \u2014 an offshoot of Dutch that was developed by white settlers \u2014 and a fierce critic of apartheid that was imposed against the country's Black majority between 1948 and 1990.",

      "A federal judge in Texas is set to hold a hearing on whether the satirical news outlet The Onion made a valid bid for the Infowars platforms of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones",
      "A bankruptcy judge is set to hear arguments Monday in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones \u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with him.",
      "It's not clear how soon U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will issue a ruling. He could allow The Onion to move forward with the sale, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Regardless, Jones has set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts that would allow him keep airing his show. And his personal account with 3.3 million followers on the social platform X was not part of the sale, although Lopez will be deciding whether it should be included in the liquidation and sold off later.",
      "Jones' bankruptcy and the liquidation of his assets came about after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones was found liable for defamation and emotional distress damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas for repeatedly calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Jones alleged The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of those families, the humor site and a court-appointed trustee who is overseeing the liquidation.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected among the sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account.",
      "In a court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "But at a Nov. 14 hearing Lopez said he was concerned about the process and transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Jones has brought in millions of dollars a year in revenue by hawking nutritional supplements, clothing, survival gear and other merchandise \u2014 including more than $22 million this year through Sept. 30 from his Infowars Store website, according to court documents.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court earlier this year said Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade.",
      "The unveiling of the exhibition \u201cEye to Eye\u201d has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars.",
      "\u201cThe first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,\u201d said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum.",
      "\u201cIf such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it\u2019s enough. They are really precious.\u201d",
      "The government of Iran\u2019s Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran\u2019s cultural standing on the world stage.",
      "But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum\u2019s vault. Some paintings \u2014 cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art \u2014 sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution.",
      "Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes.",
      "Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, \u201cJacqueline Kennedy II,\u201d is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers.",
      "\u201cA lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that\u2019s why this show distinguishes itself from others,\u201d said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. \u201dA lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.\u201d",
      "The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a \u201csoft\u201d cultural war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion.",
      "Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger.",
      "And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach.",
      "\u201cThis is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It\u2019s extremely exciting to see the works here,\u201d said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. \u201cI had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "A special tribunal has rejected a legal claim against Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency by more than 300 survivors of a bombing that killed 22 people at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester",
      "LONDON -- A legal claim against Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency by more than 300 survivors of a bombing that killed 22 people at a 2017 Ariana Grande concert in Manchester was rejected Friday by a special tribunal.",
      "Judges on the U.K.\u2019s Investigatory Powers Tribunal said the claimants waited too long to bring their case, which alleged that MI5 violated their human rights by failing to take measures that could have prevented the disaster.",
      "Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande's concert on May 22, 2017, as thousands of young fans were leaving. As well as the 22 dead, more than 100 people were injured, many of them children and teenagers. Abedi died in the explosion.",
      "An official inquiry reported last year that MI5 didn\u2019t act swiftly enough on key information and missed a significant opportunity to prevent the bombing, the deadliest extremist attack in the U.K. in recent years.",
      "Abedi had been a \u201csubject of interest\u201d to MI5 officials in 2014, but his case was closed shortly after because he was deemed to be low risk.",
      "The report also found one MI5 officer considered intelligence about Abedi to be a possible national security concern, but didn\u2019t discuss it with colleagues quickly enough.",
      "Ken McCallum, the head of MI5, said in a rare televised statement that he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d his agency was unable to prevent the attack.",
      "Justice Rabinder Singh said the tribunal was \u201cconscious of the horrendous impact of the atrocity\u201d on the victims but said it would not be fair to let the claims proceed when they could have been filed sooner.",
      "\u201cAny reasonable person would have sympathy for them,\" Singh said. \u201cThe grief and trauma which they have suffered, particularly where young children were killed, is almost unimaginable.\"",
      "Singh also noted that if the case had proceeded it would have taken MI5 away from its core mission.",
      "Three law firms representing the victims said in a statement that the ruling was \u201cextremely disappointing.\u201d",
      "\"Our clients have had to endure continued delays but have done so with great patience and understanding in the hope that by allowing all legal processes to be fully explored, transparency and justice would be achieved,\u201d the statement said."

      "With his surprise-dropped \u201cGNX,\u201d Kendrick Lamar roars from zero to 60 faster than a turbocharged \u201987 Buick, faster than you can shout \u201cMustaaaaard.\u201d And waaaaay faster than you can decode the dense biblical centerpiece \u201cReincarnated.\u201d",
      "Keeping the same energy of his landmark Pop Out concert five months ago, Lamar surrounds himself with up-and-coming Los Angeles artists \u2014 from AzChike to Peysoh \u2014 and raps over thumping New West Coast soundscapes shaped by his longtime producer Sounwave, along with Jack Antonoff and a garageful of other beat mechanics. He\u2019s once again \u201cpossessed by a spirit,\u201d sprinkling 2Pac, Biggie and Nas references throughout and maintaining a me-against-the-world antipathy that includes but extends well beyond a certain Canadian: \u201cI just strangled me a GOAT\u201d and \u201cnow it\u2019s plural.\u201d",
      "Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Andrew Schulz, and even Fox\u2019s Super Bowl broadcast can\u2019t escape K-Dot\u2019s chaotic crosshairs.

      "This is Lamar leaning into the same creativity-juicing pride, self-righteous anger and supreme confidence that fueled the Grammy-nominated \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and won his Drake feud: \u201cI kill \u2018em all before I let \u2018em kill my joy.\u201d And yet, as with his first-ever hit \u201cSwimming Pools (Drank),\u201d even the most club-ready braggadocio songs \u2014 and there are plenty, including the massive \u201csquabble up\u201d and synth-stabbed Mustard production \u201chey now\u201d \u2014 are slapped with a caution sticker. Introspection is baked into Lamar\u2019s art. In \u201cman at the garden,\u201d he\u2019s surveying his kingdom and glory and declares that while \u201cI deserve it all,\u201d \u201cdangerously / nothing changed with me / still got pain in me.\u201d",
      "At age 37, Lamar remains in peak form (that breath control!) and stands alone in the rap world as a star who bridges generations without chasing trends. He generates his own gravity in the hip-hop universe. Pulling samples from the early \u201980s \u2014 Debbie Deb, Luther Vandross, Whodini \u2014 he\u2019s able to switch cadences and lyrical perspectives mid-song without ever losing the listener.",
      "Album closer \u201cgloria,\u201d one of two tracks featuring former TDE labelmate SZA, is a glorious celebration of the pain and power of writing. In the vein of Common\u2019s \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d or Nas\u2019 \u201cI Gave You Power,\u201d Lamar\u2019s love story details a \u201ccomplicated relationship\u201d that listeners at first may think is about his longtime partner Whitney Alford, but turns out to be dedicated to his pen.",
      "While carefully structured, \u201cGNX\u201d feels a bit more scattershot than Lamar\u2019s traditionally concept-heavy studio albums. And there are hints that this collection of 12 songs is more of a \u201cPart 1\u201d or mixtape-type prelude to something more formal: The brief music video announcing the album features a snippet of a song that doesn\u2019t even appear on \u201cGNX.\u201d",
      "Whatever comes next, the Pulitzer Prize winner has written another thrilling chapter in what remains the most fascinating longform story in hip-hop: an ambitious and searingly talented poet from Compton working through his \u2014 and the world\u2019s \u2014 contradictions on the biggest stage, forever discomforted by his crown. ___",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who helped two hired killers after they gunned down rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery will not serve time in prison under a sentence of six years' probation, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson, 27, pleaded guilty in June 2023 to three counts of serving as an accessory after the shooting. Johnson helped Cornelius Smith Jr. and Justin Johnson, his half-brother, communicate by cellphone while they were on the run from authorities after the daytime ambush.",
      "Justin Johnson was convicted on Sept. 26 of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 35 years. Smith has been charged with first-degree murder and he testified at Justin Johnson's trial, saying they fatally shot Young Dolph.",
      "Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell sentenced Jermarcus Johnson to a six-year diversionary program where he will undergo job training, submit to drug testing, refrain from possessing a gun and serve 20 hours of community service per year. His record could be cleared if he successfully completes the program.",
      "Speaking with reporters after the sentencing, prosecutor Paul Hagerman noted that Jermarcus Johnson had no role in the actual killing of Young Dolph.",
      "\u201cHe was used by his brother,\u201d Hagerman said. \"He is not a criminal.\"",
      "Young Dolph, whose real name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was fatally shot in November 2021 at a bakery located near the house where he grew up. Known for charitable works in Memphis, the 36-year-old rapper and independent music label owner was in the city to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an event that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Justin Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of his artists were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "Hagerman, the prosecutor, told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cnumber two person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "During the hearing where he pleaded guilty, Jermarcus Johnson acknowledged taking possession of a cellphone and car from Justin Johnson. Jermarcus Johnson also identified a photo in which Justin Johnson was wearing the same clothing as one of the two shooters.",
      "Jermarcus Johnson also testified during his half-brother's trial. His lawyer, Josh Corman, said Friday that Jermarcus Johnson \u201cwas put in a bad situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all think it's a fair resolution,\u201d Corman said.",
      "Another man, Hernandez Govan, whom Smith identified as a go-between with Big Jook, has pleaded not guilty to organizing the killing. Govan\u2019s trial has been set for March 10.",
      "Right after the shooting, Makeda's Homemade Cookies turned into a makeshift memorial for Young Dolph, with fans praying in the parking lot and writing messages of condolences and love on plywood covering the shot-out windows. The bakery closed for months but has since reopened.",
      "He also was honored by the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA during a game. Murals of the rapper were painted around the city. A neighborhood street was named after him.",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \u201cKing of Memphis.\u201d He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others.",

      "Alice Brock has died at age 83",
      "NEW YORK -- Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \u201cAlice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Her death, just a week before Thanksgiving, was announced Friday by Guthrie on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records. Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. Other details were not immediately available.",
      "\u201cThis coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\u201d Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we\u2019d never have another chance to talk together.\u201d",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend, Richard Robbins, were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014 whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant \u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant / Walk right in it\u2019s around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice\u2019s Restaurant.",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of the popular culture. \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name. Alice Brock would write a memoir, \u201cMy Life as a Restaurant,\u201d and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \u201cMooses Come Walking.\u201d At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband. Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \u201cAlice's Restaurant\u201d advised: \u201cYou can get anything you want\u201d at Alice's Restaurant, \u201cexcepting Alice.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- The microbudget movie \"Hundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into lo-fi legend. Mike Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman, played by his friend Ryland Tews, at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes. It's played in at least one theater a week since opening in January. On Dec. 5, it will play in more theaters than any point before.",
      "It's no overnight sensation. It's been two years since Cheslik first premiered \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "Here's how it happened:",
      "Like all great ideas, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d started at a bar. In October 2018, Cheslik and Tews \u2014 friends since they were 15 growing up in Wisconsin \u2014 were talking over how they could expand from their last film, \u201cLake Michigan Monster,\u201d an antic, even lower budgeted B-movie about the hunt for a Great Lakes sea monster. It culminated in an elaborate animation sequence by Cheslik, a trial run for \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d",
      "For their next movie, Cheslik imagined something reminiscent of childhood, with snowball fights and sled chases. Oh, and mascot costumes. \u201cBecause mascots falling down is a universal language,\u201d Tews says. \u201cEveryone thinks that\u2019s funny.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love slapstick and I don\u2019t know why it was a dormant genre for so long,\u201d adds Cheslik. \u201cMy guess is that when a country shifts from having more physical jobs to more of a service economy then the sense of humor becomes more verbal. The alligator in a pit is an HR referral instead of getting hurt at your job.\u201d",
      "They made \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d over two winters during the pandemic, with pick-up shoots in between. It wasn\u2019t particularly fun work \u2014 they were outside in negative degree weather schlepping gear through the snow. But they were making exactly the movie they wanted, without compromise. And it didn\u2019t resemble anything at the multiplex.",
      "\u201cRyland and I complained about movies a lot during the making of \u2018Hundreds of Beavers,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cI think we just complained for six years straight.\u201d",
      "Cheslik and Tews are not proponents of high-priced gear. Making a movie, they say, doesn\u2019t have be an 8K camera and a rented location.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not camera nerds,\u201d says Cheslik. \u201cWe just like images with strong shapes. We like to say: Shapes are free.\u201d",
      "In editing, Cheslik brought those shapes into greater relief. \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d plays out as a surreal ballet of chiaroscuro pratfalls, with cartoonish figures set against a white winter expanse. The beavers, themselves, never totaled more than six, with Tews, Cheslik or friends variously acting inside the costumes. Almost every shot in the movie required at least some effects work.",
      "\u201cWhat you can do is go on your computer and take those six and duplicate them. I\u2019m talkin\u2019 12 beavers. I\u2019m talkin\u2019, imagine a number, 18,\u201d deadpans Cheslik. \u201cIt\u2019s technical stuff.\u201d",
      "Once it was finally done, they excitedly hit the festival circuit. After debuting \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d at the Fantastic Fest, they played more festivals. And then some more. The crowd reaction was great and they won an audience award at the Fantasia Film Festival in 2023. But a decent offer never came. The old way of shopping a movie at a festival, they found, didn\u2019t really exist anymore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to make a movie,\u201d says Tews. \u201cThat\u2019s just the very beginning.\u201d",
      "Producer Kurt Ravenwood decided to explore a self release. They sold streaming rights to Cineverse, the company that recently distributed the indie horror hit \u201cTerrifier 3.\u201d But they kept theatrical, merchandising and Blu-ray rights.",
      "\u201cIt was a calculated risk to keep theatrical rights to ourselves,\u201d Ravenwood says. \u201cWe had never, ever in our lives put on a theatrical run. But we knew that if we were able to get it booked, it would do well.\u201d",
      "They hired a distribution veteran to help book theaters and a publicist to spread the word. And they crossed their fingers.",
      "\u201cWe believe that indie movies that go into the digital nothingness of streaming don\u2019t get into the culture,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cSo we kicked it off with this roadshow. At first, we needed to prove to theaters that people would show up. Besides just the movie, we\u2019d bring the circus to town.\u201d",
      "Calling it the \u201cGreat Lakes Roadshow,\u201d they rented out theaters and played \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d to mostly sold-out screenings in the Midwest. They didn\u2019t just play the movie, but created a vaudeville act to go along with it. The beaver mascot costumes came out of the closet.",
      "\u201cIf anything, this is what Instagram creators and TikTok creators are used to every day,\u201d says Ravenwood. \u201cThey both make the content and distribute the content via platform. If filmmakers want to reach an audience, they have to treat it like online creators treat it.\u201d",
      "Their quixotic gambit worked. People and media started taking notice. \u201cBeaver fever,\u201d as they say, took hold. None of it happened quickly, or easily. Ravenwood shipped a lot of posters and digital versions of the film. Cheslik and Tews spent two years just releasing their movie. Six years had passed since they had started. Making \u201cThe Revenant\u201d looked, comparatively, like a piece of cake. But they did it.",
      "\u201cIt was a life goal that was achieved,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cWhich is just a horrible thing to have happen.\u201d",
      "They are already pondering their next movie; notecards hung on the wall behind Cheslik. For now, he\u2019s only saying that it will, like \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d feature precise physical comedy.",
      "The beaver suits? Cheslik imagines they must now be filled with black mold that after being torn and repaired countless times, going through two Wisconsin winters, dozens of festivals and some 20 roadshows.",
      "Next time, he and Tews hope is a little easier \u2014 a little easier to make a living from, and a little easier to find their way into theaters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love when people say, \u2018Our goal with this film just to get it out there. I don\u2019t care if I make money,\u2019\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cAre these films vanity projects for trust fund hobbyists, or is this an industry?\u201d"

      "In his sixth season as chief conductor, Kirill Petrenko is leading the Berlin Philharmonic on its 25th U.S. tour and second in three years",
      "NEW YORK -- Kirill Petrenko thought about the challenge of leading the Berlin Philharmonic, perhaps the world\u2019s greatest orchestra.",
      "\u201cA hundred musicians have 100 opinions and 100 expectations \u2014 100 different expectations,\u201d the conductor said.",
      "Stefan Dohr, the principal horn, estimated forming a unified interpretation is even more arduous.",
      "\u201cI think everybody has more than one opinion,\u201d he said.",
      "In his sixth season as chief conductor, Petrenko is leading the orchestra on its 25th U.S. tour and second in three years. There are eight performances from Nov. 15-26 in Washington, D.C.; New York; Boston; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Chicago.",
      "One program includes Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cThe Isle of the Dead,\u201d Korngold\u2019s Violin Concerto and Dvor\u00e1k\u2019s Seventh Symphony. The other is devoted to Bruckner\u2019s Fifth Symphony, a sprawling work of about 80 minutes played to mark the 200th anniversary of the composer's birth in September.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 52 now,\u201d Petrenko said during a Zoom news conference with U.S. media ahead of the tour. \u201cMaybe my previous 10, 20 years were more connected with Mahler, also because of my Jewish heritage, maybe because I also am some sort of outsider \u2014 no home here, no home there. But maybe it will change and now I worked very intensively with this Bruckner.\u201d",
      "Carnegie Hall concerts this week showed breathtaking emotional depth and clarity. Petrenko signaled poignant pauses with nods and cathartic crescendos with arms sweeping sharply as if tennis backhands.",
      "He is the latest in the orchestra's distinguished line of chief conductors that include Hans von B\u00fclow, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle.",
      "In an age of widespread audio and video streams, live performances remain an unmatched experience. The U.S. is the second-largest market behind Germany for the orchestra\u2019s digital concert hall, launched in 2008-09.",
      "\u201cThe touring is really important because we want to first meet our audiences,\u201d orchestra general manager Andrea Zietzschmann said. \u201cWe are artists, and we have a strong ambassador role.\u201d",
      "Thirty-four nations are represented among the orchestra\u2019s 130 members. There are five Americans, including Noah Bendix-Balgley, one of the three concertmasters.",
      "Petrenko was born in Omsk, then part of the Soviet Union, in 1972 and moved as a teenager to Austria. He came to Berlin after serving as general music director of the Meininger Theater (1999-02), Berlin\u2019s Komische Oper (2002-07) and Munich\u2019s Bavarian State Opera (2013-20). His podium presence in Berlin has matured with familiarity.",
      "\u201cI can trust, and I cannot mention things too much in the rehearsal,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cMaybe just have a quick look on some occasions, not to stop rehearsal, not to interrupt the music.\u201d",
      "His opinion of Bruckner has evolved.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I came from Russia. Bruckner for me was absolutely -- I couldn\u2019t even touch it. I didn\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I came to Austria, and I had, so to say, my second childhood in Austria, since I was 18, and of course, there I heard a lot of Bruckner. I saw a lot of mountains, high mountains. I visited a lot of special Austrian kitchens and wurst hauses and, yes, I started to understand a little bit.\u201d",
      "Berlin opened its season with the Bruckner on Aug. 23 and before heading to the U.S. played it three more times at Berlin's Philharmonie plus on tour in Salzburg, Austria; London; Lucerne, Switzerland; and Frankfurt, Germany. To prepare, Petrenko listened to a 1942 recording of the orchestra led by Furtw\u00e4ngler.",
      "\u201cWe can be brilliant. We can be perfect. We can be fantastic performers,\u201d Petrenko said, \u201cbut there is some authentic side of one piece, what is today after we lost a lot of traditions, are very, very difficult to achieve, and the historic recordings are helping us.\u201d",
      "For Mahler\u2019s Ninth Symphony, he listens to Bruno Walter\u2019s performances. For Stauss\u2019 \u201cDer Rosenkavalier,\u201d it is Erich Kleiber and Clemens Krauss.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely unachievable. You can't do it today like this,\u201d Petrenko said. \u201cYou need to restore \u2014 step by step you need to go back as far as you can go back, to go to the source of this tradition.\u201d",
      "That thought and preparation is noticed by the orchestra.",

      "The low-budget movie \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has turned into a lo-fi legend",
      "NEW YORK -- Hard as it may be to believe, changing the future of cinema was not on Mike Cheslik\u2019s mind when he was making \u201cHundreds of Beavers.\u201d Cheslik was in the Northwoods of Wisconsin with a crew of four, sometimes six, standing in snow and making his friend, Ryland Tews, fall down funny.",
      "\u201cWhen we were shooting, I kept thinking: It would be so stupid if this got mythologized,\u201d says Cheslik.",
      "And yet, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has accrued the stuff of, if not quite myth, then certainly lo-fi legend. Cheslik\u2019s film, made for just $150,000 and self-distributed in theaters, has managed to gnaw its way into a movie culture largely dominated by big-budget sequels.",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a wordless black-and-white bonanza of slapstick antics about a stranded 19th century applejack salesman (Tews) at war with a bevy of beavers, all of whom are played by actors in mascot costumes.",
      "No one would call \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d expensive looking, but it\u2019s far more inventive than much of what Hollywood produces. With some 1,500 effects shots Cheslik slaved over on his home computer, he crafted something like the human version of Donald Duck\u2019s snowball fight, and a low-budget heir to the waning tradition of Buster Keaton and \u201cNaked Gun.\u201d",
      "At a time when independent filmmaking is more challenged than ever, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has, maybe, suggested a new path forward, albeit a particularly beaver-festooned path.",
      "After no major distributor stepped forward, the filmmakers opted to launch the movie themselves, beginning with carnivalesque roadshow screenings. Since opening in January, \u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d has played in at least one theater every week of the year, though never more than 33 at once. (Blockbusters typically play in around 4,000 locations.) More than half of its approximately $500,000 in ticket sales came after the movie went to video-on-demand.",
      "Daniel Scheinert, the co-director of the best picture-winning \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d recently called \u201cHundreds of \u201cBeavers\u201d \u201cthe future of cinema.\u201d That bold pronouncement, which ricocheted around film blogs, might seem extreme for a movie about a guy wearing a comically large beaver hat.",
      "But in a shrinking movie industry, DIY microbudget filmmaking may increasingly be left to fill some of the void left by risk-averse, corporate-driven Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI hope people can stop shooting things to make them look like commercials and just get back to more of the nitty gritty and letting your imagination flow,\u201d says Tews, who also co-wrote the movie with Cheslik. \u201cI just hope we stop bowing down to Hollywood and thinking they\u2019re the gold standard. Because they just aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The year-to-date box office in North America is down 11% from last year and about 25% from before the pandemic. More movies are making a tiny impact in theaters; according to Franchise Entertainment Research, 41 wide releases in 2024 have grossed less than $3 million \u2014 nearly three times the amount in 2019.",
      "The costs not just to make wide-release films but to market them has greatly shifted what even indie distributors are willing to back. Just to get eyeballs on \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which carries a $250 million budget, Paramount Pictures took the extraordinary step of running a trailer of the film simultaneously on more than 4,000 platforms, including TV networks, radio stations and digital outlets. For even the biggest movies, it\u2019s hard to get people\u2019s attention.",
      "In such an environment, where the expense of making and marketing a movie is potentially prohibitive for everything but the safest of bets, more filmmakers are questioning the economics. That\u2019s especially because after last year\u2019s strikes, movie production hasn\u2019t rebounded. In a contracting movie industry, many remain out of work.",
      "Brady Corbet, director of the highly touted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d a 3 \u00bd-hour epic shot in VistaVision, for less than $10 million, has preached that smaller budgets don\u2019t have to mean less artistic ambition. Sean Baker, whose breakthrough film \u201cTangerine\u201d was shot with iPhones, has argued movie budgets can come down without sacrificing what\u2019s on the screen. His $6 million \u201cAnora\u201d is one of the year\u2019s most acclaimed films.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s panic in LA,\u201d Baker said in an earlier interview. \u201cI\u2019m like: We don\u2019t have to make films for that much. They don\u2019t have to cost as much.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of Beavers\u201d is a more micro example, but it was likewise made with a strong belief in the big screen. On Dec. 5, the movie will begin an encore tour in theaters, at some 70 locations. That\u2019s the widest release yet for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d nearly a year after it opened. They\u2019re calling it \u201cA Northwoods Christmas.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a victory tour (with a Blu-ray release to follow) for \u201cHundreds of Beavers,\u201d a barnstorming indie hit that Cheslik hopes shows aspiring filmmakers that the same kind of goofy inventiveness that goes into a TikTok video can be channeled into a movie.",
      "\u201cYou still can do whatever you want,\u201d Cheslik says. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to stop you if you take a phone and make a 90-minute timeline instead of a 30-second timeline.\"",

      "Disabled rideshare users have for years reported having less access to Lyft and Uber than able-bodied people",
      "Disabled people who use rideshare apps Lyft and Uber say their experience is not a seamless task of pressing a few buttons and being whisked to their destination minutes later.",
      "Instead, people who use wheelchairs and guide dogs have watched drivers cancel rides, charge cleaning fees for guide dogs or outright refuse to take them where they need to go.",
      "The rideshare companies plan to push app updates soon to address cancellations and misunderstandings, but advocates and disabled users say they want to see drivers be better educated about how to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and want the companies to put in stricter discrimination policies. The new app features are just \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d said Lynn Dubinsky.",
      "\u201cThis option puts the burden back on the client rather than on the companies themselves to directly address (discrimination) with their drivers,\u201d said Dubinsky, who works for a guide-dog training school in San Rafael, California.",
      "Uber and Lyft have been the target of past federal lawsuits that allege they didn't follow ADA laws; Uber settled its suit in 2022 and Lyft settled a separate one in 2020. While rideshare apps aren't the only option for disabled people across the U.S. \u2014 public transit agencies must also have ADA-compliant buses and trains and offer paratransit options like shuttles \u2014 the disabled community relies on rideshare more than others, according to 2022 U.S. Bureau of Transportation statistics.",
      "That's the case for Amber Sherrard, who is blind and has a guide dog named Della.",
      "The 32-year-old Denver resident has grown accustomed to drivers refusing to transport Della, whom she prefers to bring along instead of using a cane, which she says is less safe. Once, she ended up getting a ride from strangers at Denver's airport because a rideshare driver wouldn't allow Della in the car.",
      "Uber's app update will give users a way to identify as blind or deaf. Lyft will allow users to tell a driver they have a service animal \u2014 something that Uber launched as a small pilot program earlier this week in the U.S. and Canada. Both rideshare companies have hotlines for people to report drivers who refuse to allow them into their cars with a service animal.",
      "Sherrard said she's skeptical that the new app features will help, since she usually informs drivers about her guide dog and figured out how to add that she's visually impaired to her profile name to cut down on cancellations.",
      "\u201cJust like every other person in America working multiple jobs, trying to survive, I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d she said of drivers who've denied her rides. \u201cI have just as many bills as anyone else. I have just as many working hours as everyone else. I have just as many errands and things to do to survive as anyone else.\u201d",
      "Robert Silva has had issues with rideshare drivers because of his folding wheelchair, which he has used since losing his right leg in a car accident. The 34-year-old from Alameda, California, said he once tried ordering a rideshare five times in an hour and a half to go to Disneyland before a driver accepted his request.",
      "\u201cThey just see me in a wheelchair, first thing, and they\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s going to be a lot of baggage there,\u201d said Silva, who usually can get into a vehicle without assistance. \u201cI\u2019m sure when they see me they think it\u2019s going to be a lot more work than it actually is.\u201d",
      "Uber and Lyft said their disability policies include following the ADA and not denying rides to people solely because they have a guide dog. The companies also said new drivers are made aware of the policies during onboarding, and that established drivers get occasional reminders of disability policies. If drivers wrongfully decline to accommodate riders because of a service animal, they face a potential ban.",
      "Under the ADA, U.S. cities that have public transportation must provide paratransit at a comparable cost to the regular transit system.",
      "Cathy Johnston, 70, uses Atlanta's MARTA Mobility paratransit program so she doesn't have to leave her power wheelchair behind for a foldable wheelchair like she does when using Uber or Lyft.

      "Extreme weather is making power outages longer and more frequent across the U.S. People with health conditions who depend on medical devices powered by electricity are particularly vulnerable",
      "HOUSTON -- Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter.",
      "The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage.",
      "\u201cIt was miserable,\u201d Rubit said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of it.\u201d",
      "Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d caused roughly half a million outages.",
      "People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes.",
      "At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is \"actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,\u201d Hernandez said.",
      "In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid.",
      "Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston\u2019s power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general.",
      "CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: \u201cto build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.\u201d",
      "Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths.",
      "The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,\u201d said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. \u201cThere are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,\u201d he said.",
      "Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies.",
      "Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can\u2019t disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 94 degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius).",
      "In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills.",
      "The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated that we didn\u2019t get the services that we needed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that we have had to suffer.\u201d",
      "Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn\u2019t meant to be used for long periods.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything from CenterPoint,\" Burks said. \"We\u2019re always the last to get it.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe are so sad to say that our beautiful girl Holly is now at peace,\" her family said in a statement sent to Australian Network 10 and other Australian media. \u201cWe find comfort and solace in knowing that Holly brought so much joy and happiness to so many people.\u201d",
      "An officer at Vang Vieng's Tourism Police office, who refused to give his name, told The Associated Press on Friday that a \u201cnumber of people\u201d had been detained in the case but that no charges have yet been filed. Staff at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, which was still operating but not accepting new guests, confirmed that the manager and owner were among those taken in for questioning.",
      "Tourist police offices are common in Southeast Asia and are set up specifically to help with incidents involving tourists and other foreigners.",
      "The U.S. State Department on Friday issued a health alert for citizens traveling in Laos, warning of \u201csuspected methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng, possibly through the consumption of methanol-laced alcoholic drinks,\" following similar alerts from other countries whose citizens were involved.",

      "The Foreign Ministry has refused to comment, and in Vang Vieng the small hospital where some of the victims are believed to have been treated initially referred all questions to the town's health office on the hospital grounds. The town health officials refused to comment, saying they lacked proper permission.",
      "Methanol is sometimes added to mixed drinks at disreputable bars as a cheaper alternative to ethanol, but can cause severe poisoning or death. It is also a byproduct of poorly distilled homebrew liquor, and could have found its way into bar drinks inadvertently.",
      "Landlocked Laos is one of Southeast Asia\u2019s poorest nations and a popular tourist destination. Vang Vieng is particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports.",
      "Neil Farmiloe, a New Zealander who owns the Kiwi Kitchen restaurant in town, said a lot of his customers were very worried about the incident.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s never happened before, so it is hopefully just a one-off incident,\" said Farmiloe, who has lived in Vang Vieng for 20 years. \"It\u2019s very sad all around. I\u2019m sure nobody intended to cause injury, but it\u2019s happened.\u201d",

      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",

      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F.

Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",

      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",

    "story": [
      "Most people taking popular drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight have shed significant pounds",
      "Unlike scores of people who scrambled for the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy to lose weight in recent years, Danielle Griffin had no trouble getting them.",
      "The 38-year-old information technology worker from New Mexico had a prescription. Her pharmacy had the drugs in stock. And her health insurance covered all but $25 to $50 of the monthly cost.",
      "For Griffin, the hardest part of using the new drugs wasn\u2019t access. It was finding out that the much-hyped medications didn\u2019t really work for her.",
      "\u201cI have been on Wegovy for a year and a half and have only lost 13 pounds,\u201d said Griffin, who watches her diet, drinks plenty of water and exercises regularly. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything right with no success. It\u2019s discouraging.\u201d",
      "In clinical trials, most participants taking Wegovy or Mounjaro to treat obesity lost an average of 15% to 22% of their body weight \u2014 up to 50 pounds or more in many cases. But roughly 10% to 15% of patients in those trials were \u201cnonresponders\u201d who lost less than 5% of their body weight.",
      "Now that millions of people have used the drugs, several obesity experts told The Associated Press that perhaps 20% of patients \u2014 as many as 1 in 5 \u2014 may not respond well to the medications. It's a little-known consequence of the obesity drug boom, according to doctors who caution eager patients not to expect one-size-fits-all results.",
      "\u201cIt's all about explaining that different people have different responses,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, an obesity expert at Massachusetts General Hospital",
      "The drugs are known as GLP-1 receptor agonists because they mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1. Genetics, hormones and variability in how the brain regulates energy can all influence weight \u2014 and a person's response to the drugs, Stanford said. Medical conditions such as sleep apnea can prevent weight loss, as can certain common medications, such as antidepressants, steroids and contraceptives.",
      "\u201cThis is a disease that stems from the brain,\u201d said Stanford. \u201cThe dysfunction may not be the same\u201d from patient to patient.",
      "Despite such cautions, patients are often upset when they start getting the weekly injections but the numbers on the scale barely budge.",
      "\u201cIt can be devastating,\u201d said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. \u201cWith such high expectations, there\u2019s so much room for disappointment.\u201d",
      "That was the case for Griffin, who has battled obesity since childhood and hoped to shed 70 pounds using Wegovy. The drug helped reduce her appetite and lowered her risk of diabetes, but she saw little change in weight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional roller coaster,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want it to work like it does for everybody else.\u201d",
      "The medications are typically prescribed along with eating behavior and lifestyle changes.",
      "It\u2019s usually clear within weeks whether someone will respond to the drugs, said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Weight loss typically begins right away and continues as the dosage increases.",
      "For some patients, that just doesn't happen. For others, side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea force them to halt the medications, Dushay said. In such situations, patients who were counting on the new drugs to pare pounds may think they\u2019re out of options.",
      "\u201cI tell them: It's not game over,\u201d Dushay said.",
      "Trying a different version of the new class of drugs may help. Griffin, who didn't respond well to Wegovy, has started using Zepbound, which targets an additional hormone pathway in the body. After three months of using the drug, she has lost 7 pounds.",
      "\u201cI'm hoping it's slow and steady,\u201d she said.",
      "Other people respond well to older drugs, the experts said. Changing diet, exercise, sleep and stress habits can also have profound effects. Figuring out what works typically requires a doctor trained to treat obesity, Saunders noted.",
      "\u201cObesity is such a complex disease that really needs to be treated very comprehensively,\u201d she said. \u201cIf what we\u2019re prescribing doesn\u2019t work, we always have a backup plan.\u201d",

      "It was their only meal Wednesday \u2014 it was all they could afford.",
      "\u201cMy girls suck on their thumbs because of how hungry they are, and I pat their backs until they sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "After being displaced five times, the Eids reside in central Gaza, where aid groups have relatively more access than in the north, which has been largely isolated and heavily destroyed since Israel began waging a renewed offensive against the militant group Hamas in early October. But nearly everyone in Gaza is going hungry these days. In the north experts say a full-blown famine may be underway.",
      "On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of using \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare\u201d \u2014 charges Israel adamantly denies.",
      "In Deir al-Balah, the Eids are among hundreds of thousands sheltering in squalid tent camps. The local bakeries shut down for five days this week. The price of a bag of bread climbed above $13 by Wednesday, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived.",
      "The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a \u201cstark increase\u201d in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. The amount of food Israel has let into Gaza the past seven weeks has plummeted, now at nearly the lowest levels of the entire war.",
      "Even less than that is reaching the territory\u2019s 2.3 million Palestinians because of the many obstacles to distribution, aid groups and the U.N. say \u2013 including restrictions on movement by the Israeli military, ongoing fighting, damage to roads, and theft. Armed men robbed nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits.",
      "For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry.",
      "\u201cEverything has increased in price, and we cannot buy anything,\" she said. \u201cWe always go to sleep without having dinner.\u201d",
      "She misses coffee, but a single packet of Nescafe goes for around $1.30. A kilogram (2 pounds) of onions goes for $10, a medium bottle of cooking oil for $15 \u2014 if available. Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes.",
      "Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling.",
      "Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they \u201ccan go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.\u201d",
      "Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day.",
      "Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing.",
      "But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war.",
      "Israel blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving the aid, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. The U.N. says it often cannot reach the border to pick up aid cargos because the Israeli military denies requests for movement and because of ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. As a result, it says, only about half the incoming aid is distributed.",
      "The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are dead, and Hamas militants have repeatedly regrouped after Israeli operations, carrying out hit-and-run attacks from tunnels and bombed-out buildings.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza.

    "story": [
      "Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Drug reform advocates hailed Oregon as a progressive leader when it became the first in the nation to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the compound found in psychedelic mushrooms.",
      "But four years later, voters in a growing list of its cities have banned the substance.",
      "Four cities, spanning Portland suburbs and rural and coastal towns, added new voter-approved prohibitions for the federally illegal compound in the Nov. 5 election. A dozen other communities that approved two-year moratoriums in 2022, when a majority of Oregon counties and over 100 cities voted to temporarily or permanently ban psilocybin, voted in this election to make the restrictions permanent.",
      "In the wake of the fentanyl crisis, the rejection of drug liberalization measures in Oregon and states across the country this election has some experts questioning whether voters are rethinking their appetite for such policies.",
      "In Massachusetts, for example, voters rejected a measure that would have allowed residents over 21 to grow and use plant-based psychedelic drugs in certain circumstances. All three states that had measures to legalize recreational marijuana voted against it.",
      "Oregon voters, in particular, appear to have soured on drug reform. A law passed by voters four years ago that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of hard drugs, including heroin and methamphetamine, was rolled back by the state legislature earlier this year after heated debate over whether it played a role in a spike in public drug use and deaths.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the fact that the drug policy reform pendulum appears to be swinging back towards prohibition is part of a broader trend toward a preference for \u2018law and order\u2019 among American voters,\" said Josh Hardman, founder of Psychedelics Alpha, a consulting firm and newsletter on psychedelic research, business and policy. \u201cOregon, specifically, has been touted as an example of liberal drug policies gone wrong.\"",
      "Despite the local bans, psilocybin remains accessible in over 30 licensed centers spanning the state\u2019s most populous cities, like Portland, and a handful of small towns. Some rural counties also have voted to stay in the program.",
      "However, access to therapeutic psilocybin is further complicated by high costs: One session can be up to $2,000 out of pocket. That is largely because center owners and facilitators have to pass on licensure expenses to consumers in order to stay afloat.",
      "MJ Wilt, who just opened a licensed center in the Portland suburb of Gresham, spent tens of thousands of dollars of her own savings to get licensed and establish her center. It has been hard, she said, because her own experience with psilocybin changed her life for the better and she wants to bring that experience to others.",
      "\u201cThe cost for the program has been astronomical and is not accessible to people across the socioeconomic spectrum,\u201d Wilt said. \u201cIt's certainly not the cash cow that people think or thought it was going to be.\u201d",
      "In 2020, roughly 56% of Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which allowed for the manufacture and controlled, therapeutic use of psilocybin at licensed facilities for those over 21. But the measure allowed counties and cities to vote to opt out, resulting in a patchwork of regulations across the state.",
      "Adding to the complexity, some cities have voted to allow psilocybin despite being in counties that banned it, as cities control the land incorporated within their borders while counties control unincorporated land.",
      "The regulatory patchwork resembles that of cannabis law. In half of the 24 states that have legalized recreational cannabis, including Oregon, localities may opt out of most types of cannabis businesses, according to Kate Bryan, a policy specialist on criminal and civil justice at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Colorado in 2022 became the only other state to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use. It will begin accepting license applications for \u201chealing centers\u201d at the end of December, a spokesperson for the state's natural medicine division said in an email. The law allows localities to adopt certain regulations regarding how the centers operate, but it does not allow them to ban such centers entirely.",
      "Multiple cities across the country also have voted to decriminalize psilocybin, meaning a person cannot be arrested or prosecuted for possessing limited amounts of plant-based hallucinogens.",
      "Psilocybin, found in several species of mushrooms, can cause hours of vivid hallucinations. Indigenous people have used it in healing rituals, and scientists are exploring whether it can help treat depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Researchers and military veterans are among those who have advocated for the study of the substance for therapeutic use.",
      "Kat Thompson, the founder and CEO of Fractal Soul, a licensed psilocybin center in the Portland suburb of Beaverton, said her center has served 400 people in its first year and that the \u201cvast majority\u201d have had positive outcomes. Many come seeking help for depression, anxiety, trauma and addiction after years of trying talk therapy and medication, she said, while others come to process grief or explore their spirituality.",
      "But she said a lack of public awareness about the state's psilocybin program has led many to confuse it with Measure 110, the separate ballot measure also passed in 2020 that decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs. The botched implementation of the law \u2014 also a first of its kind in the nation \u2014 and rising overdose deaths amid the fentanyl crisis fueled pushback that prompted state lawmakers to backtrack on it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe actually got lots of calls from people who had booked sessions with us who heard about the roll back of 110 and thought that that meant that we were closing,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to explain and educate the public that Measure 110 was really just about decriminalization for personal use. It has nothing to do with the professional therapeutic model.\u201d",
      "Some people also confuse the model of the psilocybin center with cannabis dispensaries. At dispensaries, people buy cannabis and leave to consume it elsewhere. People who want to use psilocybin, meanwhile, must consume it at a licensed service center under the supervision of a licensed facilitator who administers it to them and remains with them for the duration of the trip, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cThis is essentially a mental health clinic where someone is here all day with us,\u201d she said. \"By and large, it is extremely safe.\u201d",
      "Of the over 16,000 doses that have been administered since the first licensed center opened in June 2023, staff at such centers have called 911 or taken a patient to a hospital five times, an Oregon Health Authority spokesperson said in an email, confirming reporting from The Oregonian/OregonLive. There are roughly 350 licensed facilitators and a dozen psilocybin manufacturers in the state, according to the agency's most recent figures.",
      "Joe Buck, the mayor of Lake Oswego, a Portland suburb that just passed a psilocybin ban, said he wasn't surprised by the outcome, even though a majority of the city's residents supported Measure 109 in 2020.",
      "\u201cOregon really has not done a great job managing its drug policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can understand how some people may be wary of the promises that are now being made around psilocybin.\u201d",
      "But further research on psilocybin, he said, could change voters' perspective in the future.",
      "\u201cIt really is up to state leaders, leaders in the federal government, to work these drugs through a good system that builds community trust.\""

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:02:21 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump on Friday nominated Dr. Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who gained national attention for opposing vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system \u201cbroken,\" vowing a shakeup. As part of a flurry of nominations late Friday night, Trump also tapped doctor and former Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fox News contributor Janette Nesheiwat, meanwhile, is set to be the nation's next surgeon general.",
      "Some of Makary's views align closely with the man who is poised to be his boss \u2014 prominent environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump put forward as the next U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In books and articles, Makary has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators, points that Kennedy has also harped on for years.",
      "Trump said Makary, trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, \u201cwill restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\u201d",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, had concerns about booster vaccinations in young children. He was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Makary has lamented how drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Less is known about Trump's pick for the Atlanta-based CDC, which develops vaccines and monitors for infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "Weldon is a staunch, self-described \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican. Legislation he introduced more than 20 years ago outlawed human cloning. He also brokered a deal with lawmakers to bar patents on human organisms, including genetically engineered embryos. Weldon also advocated against the removal of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman whose family battle over her vegetative state turned into a national debate.",
      "Weldon's nomination is likely to placate some anti-abortion advocates, who have been concerned about Trump's nomination of Kennedy, a longtime Democrat and proponent of abortion rights, as the nation's top health official.",
      "Weldon retired from his congressional seat in 2008, after 14 years in public office. Earlier this year, he lost in a GOP primary for a seat in the Florida Legislature.",
      "If he's confirmed, he'll be in charge of more than 13,000 employees and nearly 13,000 other contract workers.",
      "Nesheiwat, meanwhile, will oversee 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members if the Republican-controlled Senate approves her nomination as the surgeon general. She is a medical director for an urgent care company in New York. She appears regularly on Fox News and has expressed frequent support for Trump, sharing photos of them together on her social media pages.",
      "Surgeons general also have the power to issue advisories, warning of public health threats in the U.S. Those advisories can influence how the government, public and medical community respond to health crises in the country.",

      "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman have died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos",
      "BANGKOK -- Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be \u201calert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning.\u201d But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it?",
      "There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents.",
      "According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early.",
      "Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected.",
      "\u201cIndividuals vary in their response to methanol,\u201d said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britain\u2019s University of Leeds. \u201cSome will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more.\u201d",
      "Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more \u201ckick\u201d and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute.",
      "Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls \u2014 often found in poorer countries \u2014 it can end up in the mix.",
      "The answer is easy: don't drink it.",
      "But it's colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge.",
      "In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britain\u2019s Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings.",
      "The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate.",
      "It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal.",

She escaped the heat to train in the United Kingdom, but worries about a day when a warming world kills her sport entirely.",
      "American discus thrower Sam Mattis described temperatures as high as 44 Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) at the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, causing some fans, officials and athletes to pass out. And New Zealand soccer player Katie Rood recalled training in heat chambers to prepare for the Tokyo Olympics, and warmups cut short in high heat and humidity.",

With billions of fans worldwide, they're among athletes and leagues trying to get more people to care, and act, on climate change.",

      "It's not all about heat. Mohan noted this year's Paris Olympics had to delay some triathlon events because heavy rains \u2014 which have increased as a warming atmosphere holds more water \u2014 contributed to high bacteria levels in the Seine River.",
      "Some top soccer clubs have gotten together in a climate action alliance aimed at reducing emissions and inspiring fans to act on climate change. One of those is La Liga club Real Betis. Rafael Muela Pastor, general manager of the club's foundation, said at another panel in Baku that soccer is \u201cthe most powerful and massive sport in the world\u201d and it's crucial that \u201cwe have to do something.\u201d",

      "FIFA \u2014 the governing body for world soccer \u2014 was unmoved by concerns about heat and human rights in holding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a country criticized for its treatment of migrant workers, among other issues. And at times, outwardly positive actions from sports leaders can be little more than greenwashing.",
      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino attended COP29 and posted on Instagram about extending a partnership with Pacific Island nations to foster \u201cclimate-resilient football development\u201d and raise awareness about climate change. That came just months after FIFA signed a sponsorship deal with Saudi Arabia's state oil giant Aramco.",

      "Climate change is also making sports more expensive and widening disparities. Jessica Murfree, assistant professor of sport administration at the University of North Carolina, said athletes will have to travel farther and spend more to train and compete as some places become incompatible with sport because it's too hot or there isn't enough snow.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to have a massive impact on athletes and athlete hopefuls,\u201d she said. \u201cIt drives a bigger socioeconomic wedge between the haves and the have-nots, which then becomes a justice issue.\u201d",
      "Sports are seeking to adapt to a hotter planet. Sometimes competitions get moved to different places, or starting times get shifted to cooler parts of the day. Then there's technology: Qatar spent billions to air-condition stadiums at its World Cup to keep fans and players cool.",
      "But sports can't air-condition its way out of the climate crisis, said Rood, the New Zealand soccer player.",
      "The energy it requires \u201cis a huge cost to the environment,\" she said in an interview, adding: \"It\u2019s not just the isolated events that happen once or twice a year. It\u2019s the training and the lead-up ... those conditions can\u2019t necessarily be created every time.\u201d",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- One of the most prominent figures from Canada's trucker protests against COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 has been found guilty on five counts including mischief and disobeying a court order.",
      "A judge ruled Friday that Pat King was guilty on one count each of mischief, counseling others to commit mischief and counseling others to obstruct police. He was also found guilty on two counts of disobeying a court order. He could face up to 10 years in prison.",
      "Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Ottawa, and besieged Parliament Hill for three weeks in early 2022, demonstrating against vaccine mandates for truckers and other precautions and condemning Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government.",
      "Members of the self-styled Freedom Convoy also blockaded U.S.-Canada border crossings in protest.",
      "The prosecution alleged King was a protest leader who was instrumental to the disruption in Ottawa. The prosecution alleged King coordinated the repeated bouts of honking, ordering the protesters to lay on the horn every 30 minutes for 10 minutes at a time, and told people to \u201chold the line\u201d when he was aware that police and the city had asked the truckers to leave.",
      "The prosecution's case relied mainly on King\u2019s own videos, which he posted to social media throughout the protest to document the demonstration and communicate with those taking part.",
      "King\u2019s lawyers argued that he was peacefully protesting and was not one of the demonstration's leaders.",
      "King was found not guilty on three counts of intimidation and one count of obstructing police himself.",
      "The truckers' convoy gridlocked downtown streets around Parliament Hill, with area residents complaining about the fumes from diesel engines running non-stop, and unrelenting noise from constant the honking of horns and music from parties.",
      "Trudeau's government ultimately invoked the Emergencies Act to try and bring an end to the protests. Ottawa Police brought in hundreds of officers from forces across Canada.",
      "The protests were first aimed at a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. They eventually encompassed fury over COVID-19 restrictions and dislike of Trudeau, reflecting the spread of disinformation in Canada and simmering populist and right-wing anger.",
      "The Freedom Convoy shook Canada\u2019s reputation for civility, inspired convoys in France, New Zealand and the Netherlands and interrupted economic trade. For almost a week the busiest U.S.-Canada border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit was blocked. It carries more than 25% of trade between the countries, who are each other's largest trading partners."

      "Yu Shang Food, Inc., of Spartanburg, South Carolina, has recalled more than 72,000 pounds of meat and poultry products tied to the outbreak, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Some products were initially recalled on Nov. 9.",
      "The foods were shipped to retail locations nationwide and available online, and illnesses have been reported in four states. The problem was discovered in October after routine tests detected listeria in the foods and the production environment.",
      "Of the 11 people sickened, nine were hospitalized, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said. A California woman who was pregnant with twins was sickened and both infants died, the CDC said, but listeria was only found in a sample from one of the infants, so that child and the mother were included in the count but the other infant wasn't.",
      "Interviews with people who were sickened and laboratory findings pointed to the Yu Shang Food products.",
      "Although the foods have been recalled, some may still be in consumers' refrigerators or freezers. The products should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase. Refrigerators, containers and other surfaces that may have touched the foods should be cleaned and sanitized.",
      "People get sick with listeria poisoning when they eat foods contaminated with the bacteria. Symptoms can be mild and include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. More serious illness can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.",
      "Listeria poisoning is tricky, because symptoms can start quickly, within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. But they also can take weeks or up to three months to show up. Those most vulnerable to getting sick include the very young, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems or who are pregnant.",
      "A different listeria outbreak tied to recalled Boar\u2019s Head deli meats has ended, CDC officials said this week. That outbreak killed 10 people this summer and sickened dozens of others.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 16:02:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's health team picks include a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host",

      "Donald Trump's health team picks include a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host",
      "The team that President-elect Donald Trump has selected to lead federal health agencies in his second administration includes a retired congressman, a surgeon and a former talk-show host.",
      "All could play pivotal roles in fulfilling a political agenda that could change how the government goes about safeguarding Americans' health \u2014 from health care and medicines to food safety and science research. In line to lead the Department of Health and Human Services secretary is environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Trump's choices don't have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, are frequent Fox News contributors.",
      "Many on the list were critical of COVID-19 measures like masking and booster vaccinations for young people. Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump's other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years and is affiliated with a medical group on the state's Atlantic coast. Nesheiwat's brother-in-law is Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., tapped by Trump as national security adviser.",
      "Here's a look at the nominees' potential role in carrying out what Kennedy says is the task to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials, and effect Americans' daily lives:",
      "The Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.",
      "Kennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is \"no vaccine that is safe and effective,\u201d and urged people to resist the CDC's guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.",
      "Decades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, 71, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.",
      "Starting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines. Kennedy, then a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, believed there was a tie between thimerosal and autism and also charged that the government hid documents showing the danger.",
      "Since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.",
      "Weldon's congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths. Weldon also voted to ban federal funding for needle-exchange programs as an approach to reduce overdoses, and the National Rifle Association gave him an \u201cA\u201d rating for his pro-gun rights voting record.",
      "Kennedy is extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.",
      "Makary, Trump\u2019s pick to run the FDA, is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics. The professor at Johns Hopkins University who is a trained surgeon and cancer specialist has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "Kennedy has suggested he'll clear out \u201centire\u201d FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Makary's contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic included questioning the need for masking and giving young kids COVID-19 vaccine boosters.",
      "But anything Makary and Kennedy might want to do when it comes to unwinding FDA regulations or revoking long-standing vaccine and drug approvals would be challenging. The agency has lengthy requirements for removing medicines from the market, which are based on federal laws passed by Congress.",
      "The agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed \u2014 and an agency that Kennedy hasn't talked about much when it comes to his plans.",
      "While Trump tried to scrap the Affordable Care Act in his first term, Kennedy has not taken aim at it yet. But he has been critical of Medicaid and Medicare for covering expensive weight-loss drugs \u2014 though they're not widely covered by either.",
      "Trump said during his campaign that he would protect Medicare, which provides insurance for older Americans. Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage \u2014 a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud \u2014 in an AARP questionnaire during his failed 2022 bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania and in a 2020 Forbes op-ed with a former Kaiser Permanente CEO.",
      "Oz also said in a Washington Examiner op-ed with three co-writers that aging healthier and living longer could help fix the U.S. budget deficit because people would work longer and add more to the gross domestic product.",
      "Neither Trump nor Kennedy have said much about Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income Americans. Trump's first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "Kennedy doesn't appear to have said much publicly about what he'd like to see from surgeon general position, which is the nation's top doctor and oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members.",
      "The surgeon general has little administrative power, but can be an influential government spokesperson on what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it \u2014 suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories. The current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence as a public health crisis in June.",
      "Trump's pick, Nesheiwat, is employed as a New York City medical director with CityMD, a group of urgent care facilities in the New York and New Jersey area, and has been at City MD for 12 years. She also has appeared on Fox News and other TV shows, authored a book on the \u201ctransformative power of prayer\u201d in her medical career and endorses a brand of vitamin supplements.",
      "She encouraged COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, calling them \u201ca gift from God\u201d in a February 2021 Fox News op-ed, as well as anti-viral pills like Paxlovid. In a 2019 Q&A with the Women in Medicine Legacy Foundation, Nesheiwat said she is a \u201cfirm believer in preventive medicine\u201d and \u201ccan give a dissertation on hand-washing alone.\u201d",
      "As of Saturday, Trump had not yet named his choice to lead the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research through grants to researchers across the nation and conducts its own research. It has a $48 billion budget.",
      "Kennedy has said he'd pause drug development and infectious disease research to shift the focus to chronic diseases. He'd like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest, and criticized the agency in 2017 for what he said was not doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism \u2014 an idea that has long been debunked.",

      "ISTANBUL -- The Turkish doctor at the center of an alleged fraud scheme that led to the deaths of 10 babies told an Istanbul court Saturday that he was a \u201ctrusted\u201d physician.",
      "Dr. Firat Sari is one of 47 people on trial accused of transferring newborn babies to neonatal units of private hospitals, where they were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments in order to receive social security payments.",
      "\u201cPatients were referred to me because people trusted me. We did not accept patients by bribing anyone from 112,\u201d Sari said, referring to Turkey\u2019s emergency medical phone line.",
      "Sari, said to be the plot\u2019s ringleader, operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul. He is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison in a case where doctors, nurses, hospital managers and other health staff are accused of putting financial gain before newborns\u2019 wellbeing.",
      "The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed 10 of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal.",
      "\u201cI want to tell everything so that the events can be revealed,\u201d Sari, the owner of Medisense Health Services, told the court. \u201cI love my profession very much. I love being a doctor very much.\u201d",
      "Although the defendants are charged with the negligent homicide of 10 infants since January 2023, an investigative report cited by the state-run Anadolu news agency said they caused the deaths of \u201chundreds\u201d of babies over a much longer time period.",
      "Over 350 families have petitioned prosecutors or other state institutions seeking investigations into the deaths of their children, according to state media.",
      "Prosecutors at the trial, which opened on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies\u2019 condition appear more serious so as to obtain more money from the state as well as from families.",
      "The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and are now facing punishment for unavoidable, unwanted outcomes.",
      "Sari is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents and homicide by negligence.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors before the trial, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",
      "\u201cEverything is in accordance with procedures,\u201d he told prosecutors in a statement.",
      "The hearings at Bakirkoy courthouse, on Istanbul\u2019s European side, have seen protests outside calling for private hospitals to be shut down and \u201cbaby killers\u201d to be held accountable.",
      "The case has also led to calls for the resignation of Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, who was the Istanbul provincial health director at the time some of the deaths occurred. Ozgur Ozel, the main opposition party leader, has called for all hospitals involved to be nationalized.",
      "In a Saturday interview with the A Haber TV channel, Memisoglu characterized the defendants as \u201cbad apples\u201d who had been \u201cweeded out.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur health system is one of the best health systems in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very exceptional, very organized criminal organization. It is a mistake to evaluate this in the health system as a whole.\u201d",
      "Memisoglu also denied the claim that he shut down an investigation into the claims in 2016, when he was Istanbul\u2019s health director, calling it \u201ca lie and slander.\u201d",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said this week that those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all the blame on the country\u2019s health care system.",
      "\u201cWe will not allow our health care community to be battered because of a few rotten apples,\u201d he said."

      "A Georgia official disbanded the state's maternal mortality committee that investigates deaths of pregnant women",
      "Georgia's top health official dismissed all members of a state committee that investigates pregnancy-related maternal deaths after a committee member presumably released information about two such deaths.",
      "In a letter first reported by ProPublica and dated Nov. 8, state public health commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey said whoever shared the information violated state law and a confidential agreement signed by committee members. An agency investigation wasn't able to identify who disclosed the details.",
      "ProPublica reported in September that internal reports showed the Georgia Maternal Mortality Review Committee determined the deaths of two women were preventable, but found that doctors were hesitant to perform a procedure that could have saved their lives because of the state's strict abortion policies.",
      "The cases drew national attention and became a central theme in Vice President Kamala Harris ' presidential campaign. Harris has been outspoken on abortion rights ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than two years ago that overturned Roe v. Wade.",

      "The decision to disband the committee seems \u201cvery abrupt,\u201d said Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, one of the groups that sued Georgia over the state's abortion ban beyond six weeks of pregnancy. A judge initially struck down the ban, but Georgia's Supreme Court halted the ruling in October, restoring the law.",
      "\"To have any time where we don\u2019t have this committee in place difficult to fathom, realizing that we may lose access to really important data and information that could help us make better decisions and organize better around what we need for the state,\" Simpson said.",

      "The Georgia Department of Public Health will open applications for new members in the \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d Toomey said in the letter, but will work to make sure there is more oversight and confidentiality in its review of cases.",
      "\"This is a scare tactic meant to stop full investigations into the circumstances of pregnant women\u2019s deaths across the state,\" Alicia Stallworth, Director of Georgia Campaigns at Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"Now more than ever, it\u2019s important to mobilize against anti-abortion extremists like Governor Kemp, who are responsible for these deadly bans.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp doesn't appoint or release members of the committee because it's overseen by the Department of Public Health, Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas said. Kemp signed into law in 2019 a ban on abortions once the fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.",

      "A push by New York City jail officials to block people detained at Rikers Island from receiving physical mail was based on faulty fentanyl test strips that overstated the influx of contraband sent through the mail",
      "NEW YORK -- In 2022, New York City\u2019s jails commissioner, Louis Molina, issued a dire warning to local lawmakers: fentanyl was pouring into Rikers Island through the mail, he said, spurring an overdose crisis among the jail's detainees and putting guards at risk.",
      "As evidence of the insidious threat, Molina passed around a child\u2019s drawing of a reindeer, one of hundreds of seized items he said had been \u201cliterally soaked in the drug and mailed to people in custody.\u201d",
      "But that claim was based on faulty drug-testing kits with a stunning 85% false positive rate, according to a report released Wednesday by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation. The report found the city vastly overstated the prevalence of fentanyl sent by mail to detainees.",
      "When investigators retested 71 pieces of mail initially flagged by field tests as containing fentanyl, only 10 actually showed traces of the drug. The drawing of a reindeer highlighted by Molina was fentanyl-free.",
      "Field tests indicating an influx of fentanyl-laced mail to Rikers Island fueled a yearslong campaign by Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to bar people in city custody from receiving physical mail.",
      "As a replacement, city officials proposed redirecting mail to an offsite vendor, who would then upload it digitally for the incarcerated person to read on a tablet \u2014 a practice used in other correctional systems, including New York's state prisons. So far, the proposal has been blocked by a jail oversight board.",
      "Jocelyn Strauber, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said the city should reassess its ongoing effort to bar detainees from receiving mail, given the report\u2019s findings.",
      "\u201cThe field tests don\u2019t support a concern that a high rate of fentanyl-laced objects are coming in from the mail,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cTo the extent policy determinations are based on flawed data, they ought to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Detainee advocates have long contended that drugs primarily enter the jail system via employees, who can easily smuggle them inside and sell them to gang leaders. In recent years, dozens of correction officers have been charged in multiple investigations of smuggling rings on Rikers Island.",
      "In its report, the Department of Investigation said corrections officials had failed to implement many of the department's previous recommendations aimed at screening staff for contraband.",
      "In an email statement, a Department of Correction spokesperson said the agency would review the report and continue refining its testing processes. \u201cField tests are a tool used to quickly assess potential threats, and while not perfect, they play an important role in our safety protocols,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Such field tests have gained popularity in recent years alongside a spike in opioid overdose deaths nationwide, allowing law enforcement officials to bypass the lengthy lab process to determine if a substance contains narcotics.",
      "But experts have long raised questions about the strips' effectiveness. Under federal regulations, manufacturers are required to include language on their packaging indicating that results are preliminary until confirmed by a lab \u2014 something that rarely happens in correctional settings.",
      "Last November, New York\u2019s state prison system was found to have wrongly punished more than 2,000 detainees due to false positives from drug tests manufactured by Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories.",
      "For years, the test strips used on Rikers Island, the city-run jail system, were also provided by Sirchie. But after complaints about the reliability of the tests, the Department of Correction switched to kits made by DetectaChem last April.",
      "The review by the Department of Investigation found DetectaChem\u2019s test strips had a false positive rate of 79%, while Sirchie\u2019s were wrong 91% of the time.",
      "Inquiries to Sirchie were not returned.",
      "Travis Kisner, the chief operating officer of DetectaChem, said the company was still reviewing the report, but added: \u201cWe stand behind our product.\""

      "Here's a look at a television doctor who became a politician and is now designated to lead an agency that touches nearly all Americans in some way.",
      "Trained as a heart surgeon, Oz rose to prominence on Oprah Winfrey's leading daytime television show before spinning off his own series, \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\" in 2009.",
      "The program aired for 13 seasons and made Oz a household name.",
      "Oz stopped doing surgeries in 2018 but his physician license remains active in Pennsylvania through the end of this year, according to the state's online database.",
      "Oz is an author of New York Times bestsellers, an Emmy-winning TV show host, radio talk show host, presidential appointee, founder of a national nonprofit to educate teens about healthy habits, and self-styled ambassador for wellness.",

      "He attended a private high school in Delaware and Harvard University as a college undergraduate, also playing football there, and served in the Turkish army to maintain his dual citizenship.",
      "Oz dispensed nutritional and lifestyle advice on his show, portraying himself as a trusted doctor capable of explaining health matters in an engaging and approachable way. But his show also blurred the line between medical advice and advertising, failing to make clear to his audience just how closely he worked with the companies he pitched.",
      "He repeatedly promoted products of questionable medical value and was named in lawsuits that alleged he made misleading claims on the show.

      "Following a court battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Oz narrowly won the primary over McCormick by 951 votes but lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.",
      "Oz told The Associated Press in a 2022 interview that he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005 when he asked Trump to use his golf course for an event for Oz\u2019s children\u2019s charity. Trump agreed. After that, they saw each other intermittently at social events before Oz interviewed Trump about his health during the 2016 presidential campaign.",

    "story": [
      "Women's health advocates in Africa are worried that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will again invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that cuts off U.S. government funding for groups that offer abortion-related services",
      "EPWORTH, Zimbabwe -- Carrying her infant daughter, 19-year-old Sithulisiwe Moyo waited two hours to get birth-control pills from a tent pitched in a poor settlement on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "The outreach clinic in Epworth provides Moyo with her best shot at achieving her dream of returning to school. \u201cI am too young to be a baby-making machine,\" she said. \"At least this clinic helps me avoid another pregnancy.\u201d",
      "But the free service funded by the U.S. government, the world\u2019s largest health donor, might soon be unavailable.",
      "As he did in his first term, U.S President-elect Donald Trump is likely in January to invoke the so-called global gag rule, a policy that bars U.S. foreign aid from being used to perform abortions or provide abortion information. The policy cuts off American government funding for services that women around the world rely on to avoid pregnancy or to space out their children, as well as for heath care unrelated to abortion.",
      "The gag rule has a 40-year history of being applied by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents. Every GOP president since the mid-1980s has invoked the rule, which is known as the Mexico City Policy for the city where it was first announced.",
      "As one of his first acts as president in 2017, Trump expanded the rule to the extent that foreign NGOs were cut off from about $600 million in U.S. family planning funds and more than $11 billion in U.S. global health aid between 2017 and 2018 alone, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.",
      "The money \u2014 much of it intended for Africa \u2014 covered efforts such as preventing malaria and tuberculosis, providing water and sanitation, and distributing health information and contraception, which might also have repercussions for HIV prevention.",
      "Women\u2019s health advocates are \u201cuneasy\u201d following Trump\u2019s victory, said Pester Siraha, director of Population Services Zimbabwe, an affiliate of MSI Reproductive Choices, an NGO that supports abortion rights in 36 countries.",
      "The policy stipulates that foreign NGOs that receive U.S government funding must agree to stop abortion-related activities, including discussing it as a family planning option \u2014 even when they are using non-U.S. government funds for such activities. During Trump's first term, MSI did not agree to those conditions, effectively making it ineligible for U.S government funding.",
      "Siraha said that a blueprint offered to Trump by the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in its plan known as Project 2025 indicates that the new administration could enact \u201ca more comprehensive global gag rule.\u201d",
      "Even NGOs in countries that outlaw abortion, such as Zimbabwe, are affected. Population Services Zimbabwe, for instance, closed its outreach clinics during Trump\u2019s first term after losing funding due to its association with MSI Reproductive Choices. Such outreach clinics are often the only health care option for rural people with limited access to hospitals due to poverty or distance.",
      "\u201cIt leaves women with no place to turn for help, even for information,\u201d said Whitney Chinogwenya, global marketing manager at MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "Some NGOs in other African countries such as Uganda, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa rolled back services, including clinics, contraception, training and support for government and community health workers, as well as programs for young people, sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities.",
      "Other services shut down entirely. The risk of unplanned pregnancies, unsafe abortions and related deaths increased in many of the affected countries, according to the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.",
      "Chinogwenya, the MSI Reproductive Choices marketing manager, said her organization\u2019s donor income dropped by $120 million during Trump\u2019s first term. The money would have provided 8 million women globally with family planning help, preventing 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 pregnancy-related deaths, she said.",
      "The gag-rule policy \u201cleads to more unintended, unwanted, unsupportable pregnancies and therefore an increase in abortion,\u201d said Catriona Macleod, a professor of psychology at South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University.",
      "\u201cThis legislation does not protect life \u2026 it\u2019s been called America\u2019s deadly export,\u201d said Macleod, who heads the university\u2019s studies in sexuality and reproduction.",
      "Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded the gag-rule policy in 2021, resulting in Population Services Zimbabwe receiving $9 million, about 50% of its donor funding, from USAID in 2023. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t regained all the loss we suffered,\u201d said Siraha, the organization\u2019s director.",
      "\u201cYou need a minimum of five years to have an impact. If we then have another gap of five years, it means we are reversing all the gains,\u201d she said.",
      "Her organization estimates that 1.3 million women could lose out on the care they need in Zimbabwe, leading to an additional 461,000 unintended pregnancies and 1,400 maternal deaths if the gag rule is reinstated.",
      "Overseas aid budget cuts by other Western governments will make it harder to find alternative funding, Siraha said.",
      "MSI Reproductive Choices is lobbying world leaders and alternative donors to fight for abortion rights.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s reelection may embolden the anti-choice movement, but the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights is nonnegotiable,\u201d Chinogwenya said.",
      "However, agencies that rely heavily or entirely on U.S funding might have little choice but \u201cto quiet their guidelines on access to abortion\u201d to qualify for funding, said Denise Horn, an international relations and civil society expert at Bryant University in Rhode Island.",
      "In South Africa, where abortion is mostly legal, some NGOs, especially those without alternative funding, stopped openly discussing abortion as an option or changed their guidelines and the information they share publicly, according to an assessment by South Africa\u2019s Rhodes University and the International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, a New York-based NGO.",
      "\u201cOrganizations thus have to evaluate what is most important: the non-abortion work they will still be able to do or the principle of pro-choice,\u201d read part of the 2019 assessment report. \u201cUltimately, these organizations will have to make this difficult decision.\u201d",
      "The long lines of women at the outreach clinic in Zimbabwe\u2019s Epworth settlement underline the dire need for family planning services in impoverished communities.",
      "Engeline Mukanya, 30, said she is already struggling to support her three children with the $100 she earns monthly from plaiting women\u2019s hair. Nurses inserted a birth-control implant in her left arm to protect her from pregnancy for the next five years.",
      "Like many here, she cannot afford private providers who charge $20 to $60.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we are so far away from America yet we are being caught in the crossfire of its politics,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we want is the freedom to space our births.\u201d"

      "But Borrell later said that he did not \u201csee the Israeli government interested clearly in reaching an agreement for a cease-fire\" and that it seemed Israel was seeking new conditions. He pointed to Israel\u2019s refusal to accept France as a member of the international committee that would oversee the cease-fire's implementation.",
      "The emerging agreement would pave the way for the withdrawal of Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops from southern Lebanon below the Litani River in accordance with the U.N.

      "A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea. Here's what to know about it:",
      "National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design, production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life.",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose such limits.",
      "Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Negotiators must also decide whether the treaty will reduce or eliminate single-use plastics. They'll have to resolve whether to end the use of hazardous chemicals in plastics and whether these steps will be mandated or merely encouraged.",
      "Their common objective is to protect human health and the environment.",
      "There are some things many countries agree on. They want provisions in a treaty to promote the redesign of plastic products so they can be recycled and reused. They want to invest to better manage plastic waste. They want to increase recycling rates and help waste pickers transition to safer jobs. There is agreement that there needs to be a mechanism to help countries pay for anything required of them.",
      "Graham Forbes, who is leading a Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said his group could support an agreement that puts sensible guardrails in place to reduce the amount of plastic produced, eliminates toxic chemicals and protects people from the uncontrolled use of plastics. That's achievable, but will take political leadership and courage not seen yet in earlier negotiations, he added.",

      "The Lebanese civilians most devastated by the Israel-Hezbollah war are Shiite Muslims, and many of them believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with Hezbollah militants and often live in the same areas",
      "BEIRUT -- The Lebanese civilians most devastated by the Israel- Hezbollah war are Shiite Muslims, and many of them believe they are being unfairly punished because they share a religious identity with Hezbollah militants and often live in the same areas.",
      "\u201cThis is clear,\u201d said Wael Murtada, a young Shiite man who anxiously watched paramedics search rubble after a recent Israeli airstrike destroyed his uncle\u2019s two-story home and killed 10 people. \u201cWho else is being attacked?\u201d",
      "Israel has concentrated its attacks on villages in southern and northeastern Lebanon and neighborhoods south of Beirut. This is where many Hezbollah militants operate from, and their families live side by side with large numbers of Shiites who aren\u2019t members of the group.",
      "Israel insists its war is with Hezbollah and not the Lebanese people \u2013 or the Shiite faith. It says it only targets members of the Iran-backed militant group to try to end their yearlong campaign of firing rockets over the border. But Israel\u2019s stated objectives mean little to people like Murtada as growing numbers of Shiite civilians also die in a war that escalated sharply in recent months.",
      "Shiites don\u2019t just measure the suffering of their community in deaths and injuries. Entire blocks of the coastal city of Tyre have been flattened. Large parts of the historic market in the city of Nabatiyeh, which dates to the Ottoman era, have been destroyed. And in Baalbek, an airstrike damaged the city\u2019s famed Hotel Palmyra, which opened in the late 19th century, and a home that dates to the Ottoman era.",
      "\u201cLebanese Shias are being collectively punished. Their urban areas are being destroyed, and their cultural monuments and building are being destroyed,\u201d said Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.",
      "As Shiites flee their war-torn villages and neighborhoods, the conflict is increasingly following them to other parts of Lebanon, and this is fueling tensions.",
      "Scores of people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes on Christian, Sunni and Druze areas where displaced Shiites had taken refuge. Many residents in these areas now think twice before providing shelter to displaced people out of fear they may have links to Hezbollah.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis are targeting all of Lebanon,\u201d said Wassef Harakeh, a lawyer from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs who in 2022 ran against Hezbollah in the country\u2019s parliamentary elections and whose office was recently demolished by an Israeli airstrike. He believes part of Israel\u2019s goal is to exacerbate frictions within the small Mediterranean country, which has a long history of sectarian fighting even though diverse groups live together peacefully these days.",
      "Some Shiites say statements from the Israeli military over the years have only reinforced suspicions that their wider community is being targeted as a means to put pressure on Hezbollah.",
      "One commonly cited example is the so-called Dahiyeh doctrine, which was first espoused by Israeli generals during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. It is a reference to the southern suburbs of Beirut where Hezbollah is headquartered and where entire residential blocks, bridges and shopping compounds were destroyed in both wars. Israel says Hezbollah hides weapons and fighters in such areas, turning them into legitimate military targets.",
      "A video released by the Israeli military last month has been interpreted by Shiites as further proof that little distinction is being made between Hezbollah fighters and Shiite civilians.",
      "Speaking from a southern Lebanese village he did not name, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari called it \u201ca terror base. This is a Lebanese village, a Shiite village built by Hezbollah.\u201d As he toured a house and showed stocks of hand grenades, rifles, night-vision goggles and other military equipment, Hagari said: \u201cEvery house is a terror base.\u201d",
      "Another army spokesperson disputed the notion that Israel tries to blur the line between combatants and civilians. \u201cOur war is with the terror group Hezbollah and not with the Lebanese population, whatever its origin,\u201d said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani. He denied that Israel was intentionally trying to disrupt the social fabric of Lebanon, and pointed to Israel\u2019s evacuation warnings to civilians ahead of airstrikes as a step it takes to mitigate harm.",
      "Many Lebanese, including some Shiites, blame Hezbollah for their suffering, while also decrying Israel\u2019s bombardments. Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel last year the day after Hamas attacked Israel and started the war in Gaza; this went against the group's promises to use its weapons only to defend Lebanon.",
      "Since last October, more than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, and women and children accounted for more than 900 of the dead, according to the Health Ministry. More than 1 million people have been displaced from their homes. Shiites, who make up a third of Lebanon\u2019s 5 million people, have borne the brunt of this suffering. Israel says it has killed well over 2,000 Hezbollah members in the past year.",
      "The death and destruction in Lebanon ramped up significantly in mid-September, when Israeli airstrikes began targeting Hezbollah\u2019s leaders, and once again in early October, when Israeli ground troops invaded.",
      "Early in the war, Israeli airstrikes killed about 500 Hezbollah members but caused very little collateral damage. But since late September, airstrikes have destroyed entire buildings and homes, and in some cases killed dozens of civilians when the intended target was one Hezbollah member or official.",
      "On one particularly bloody day, Sept. 23, Israeli airstrikes killed almost 500 people and prompted hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 again, mostly Shiites -- to flee their homes in panic.",
      "Murtada\u2019s relatives fled from Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in late September after entire blocks had been wiped out by airstrikes. They moved 22 kilometers (about 14 miles) east of the city, to the predominantly Druze mountain village of Baalchmay to stay in the home of Murtada\u2019s uncle.",
      "Then, on Nov. 12, the home where they sought refuge was destroyed without warning. The airstrike killed nine relatives \u2014 three men, three women and three children \u2014 and a domestic worker, Murtada said.",
      "The Israeli army said the home was being used by Hezbollah. Murtada, who lost a grandmother and an aunt in the strike, said nobody in the home was connected to the militant group.",
      "Hezbollah has long boasted about its ability to deter Israel, but the latest war has proven otherwise and taken a severe toll on its leadership.",
      "Some Shiites fear the weakening of Hezbollah will lead to the entire community being sidelined politically once the war is over. But others believe it could offer a political opening for more diverse Shiite voices.",
      "Cease-fire negotiations to end the Israel-Hezbollah appear to have gained momentum over the past week. Some critics of Hezbollah say the group could have accepted months ago the conditions currently under consideration.",
      "This would have spared Lebanon \u201cdestruction, martyrs and losses worth billions (of dollars),\u201d Lebanese legislator Waddah Sadek, who is Sunni Muslim, wrote on X.",

    "story": [
      "Uruguay\u2019s leftist opposition candidate, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, became the country's new president in a tight runoff election that ousted the conservative governing coalition",
      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Uruguay's leftist opposition candidate, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, became the country's new president in a tight runoff Sunday, ousting the conservative governing coalition and making the South American nation the latest to rebuke the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections worldwide.",
      "Even as the vote count continued, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, the presidential candidate for the center-right ruling coalition, conceded defeat to his challenger while surrounded by sullen-looking family members and colleagues.",
      "\u201cThe country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,\u201d Orsi said to sprawling crowds of supporters that waved flags and shouted their support. \u201cI will be the president who calls for national dialogue again and again, who builds a more integrated society and country.\u201d",
      "As initial exit polls began showing Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay\u2019s Broad Front coalition, holding a lead over Delgado, cheers rang out across Montevideo\u2019s beaches.",
      "Delgado told supporters gathered at his own party\u2019s headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that he had lost. The crowd was hushed.",
      "\u201cWith sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,\u201d he told them. \"But it's one thing to lose the elections and another to be defeated. We are not defeated,\" he added, generating a burst of applause.",
      "A political heir to former President Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became a global icon for transforming Uruguay into one of the most liberal and environmentally sustainable nations in the region, Orsi rode to power on promises of safe change and nostalgia for his left-wing party's redistributive social policies.",
      "He struck a conciliatory tone, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,\u201d he said, as fireworks erupted over his stage overlooking the city's waterfront. \u201cThese people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.\u201d",
      "With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials reported that Orsi won 49.8% of the vote, ahead of Delgado\u2019s 45.9%, a clear call after weeks in which the opponents appeared tied in polls.",
      "The rest cast blank votes or abstained in defiance of Uruguay\u2019s enforced compulsory voting. Turnout in the nation with 2.7 million eligible voters reached almost 90%.",
      "Analysts say that the candidates' lackluster campaigns failed to entice apathetic young people and generated unusual levels of voter indecision.",
      "But with the rivals in broad consensus over key issues, the level-headed election was also emblematic of Uruguay's strong and stable democracy, free of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere, like the United States and neighboring Argentina.",
      "Orsi's win ushers in a return of the Broad Front that governed for 15 consecutive years until the 2019 election of center-right President Luis Lacalle Pou.",
      "\u201cI called Yamand\u00fa Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country and to put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate,\u201d Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X.",
      "The opposition's upset was the latest sign that simmering discontent over post-pandemic economic malaise favors anti-incumbent candidates. In the many elections that took place during 2024, voters frustrated with the status quo have punished ruling parties from the U.S. and Britain to South Korea and Japan.",
      "But unlike elsewhere in the world, Orsi is a moderate with no plans for dramatic change. He largely agrees with his opponent on driving down the childhood poverty rate, now at a staggering 25%, and containing an upsurge in organized crime that has shaken the nation long considered among Latin America's safest.",
      "Orsi is also likely to scupper a trade agreement with China that Lacalle Pou pursued to the chagrin of Mercosur, an alliance of South American nations promoting regional commerce.",
      "Despite Orsi's promise to lead a \u201cnew left\u201d in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs initiated under President Mujica and other Broad Front leaders.",
      "From 2005-2020, the coalition presided over a period of robust economic growth and pioneering social reforms that won widespread international acclaim, including the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana.",
      "Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began on Sunday to praise Orsi\u2019s humility and Uruguay\u2019s proud stability.",
      "\u201cThis is no small feat,\u201d he said of his nation's \u201ccitizenry that respects formal institutions.\u201d",
      "Orsi, who for a decade served as mayor of Canelones \u2014 a town of beaches and cattle ranches also home to a Google data center and upstart tech scene \u2014 proposes tax incentives to lure investment and revitalize the critical agricultural sector. He supports security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay\u2019s unions that failed to pass in the Oct. 27 general election.",
      "In that first round of voting \u2014 in which neither front-runner secured an outright majority \u2014 voters rejected generous pay-outs and the redistribution of privately managed pension funds in a rare gesture of fiscal constraint.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children\u2019s,\u201d said Yeny Varone, a nurse at a polling station who voted for Orsi. \u201cIn the future they\u2019ll have better working conditions, health and salaries.\u201d",
      "Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and campaigned under the slogan \u201cre-elect a good government.\u201d",
      "With inflation easing and the economy expected to expand by over 3% this year, Delgado promised to continue his predecessor\u2019s pro-business policies. Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, enjoyed high approval ratings, around 50%.",
      "Sunday's outcome showed Uruguayans' growing discontent with the government's failure to reverse a decade of sluggish economic growth and contain crime over the past five years. Some also attributed Delgado's loss to his lack of charisma and weak campaign strategy.",
      "\u201cDelgado struggled with communication defending the government\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Sald\u00edas, a Latin America and Caribbean senior analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit.",
      "\u201cHe was focused on criticizing the Frente Amplio (Broad Front) rather than giving a positive vision of what his government would do. It was a fear-based campaign that did not satisfy enough voters.\u201d",
      "After such a suspense-filled, close race, Orsi said his win gave him a \u201ca strange feeling that I think takes a while to come to terms with.\u201d",
      "\u201cStarting tomorrow, I'll have to work very hard,\u201d he told The Associated Press from the glass-walled NH Columbia hotel, thronged exuberant friends and colleagues. \u201cThere's a lot to do.\u201d",
      "His government will take office on March 1, 2025.",

      "The Oct. 25 airstrike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon in one of the deadliest attacks on the media since the Israel-Hezbollah war began 13 months ago.",
      "Eleven other journalists have been killed and eight wounded since then, Lebanon's Health Minister Firass Abiad said.",
      "More than 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, and women and children accounted for more than 900 of the dead, according to the Health Ministry. More than 1 million people have been displaced since Israeli ground troops invaded while Hezbollah has been firing thousands of rockets, drones and missiles into Israel \u2014 and drawing fierce Israeli retaliatory strikes.",
      "Human Rights Watch determined that Israeli forces carried out the Oct. 25 attack using an air-dropped bomb equipped with a U.S.-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, guidance kit.",
      "The group said the U.S. government should suspend weapons transfers to Israel because of the military\u2019s repeated \u201cunlawful attacks on civilians, for which U.S. officials may be complicit in war crimes.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the report.",
      "The Biden administration said in May that Israel\u2019s use of U.S.-provided weapons in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza likely violated international humanitarian law but that wartime conditions prevented U.S. officials from determining that for certain in specific airstrikes.",
      "The journalists killed in the airstrike in the southeastern town of Hasbaya were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV.",
      "Human Rights Watch said a munition struck the single-story building and detonated upon hitting the floor.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u2019s use of U.S. arms to unlawfully attack and kill journalists away from any military target is a terrible mark on the United States as well as Israel,\u201d said Richard Weir, the senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch.",
      "Weir added that \u201cthe Israeli military\u2019s previous deadly attacks on journalists without any consequences give little hope for accountability in this or future violations against the media.\u201d",
      "Human Rights Watch said that it found remnants at the site and reviewed photographs of pieces collected by the resort owner and determined that they were consistent with a JDAM guidance kit assembled and sold by the U.S. company Boeing.",
      "The JDAM is affixed to air-dropped bombs and allows them to be guided to a target by using satellite coordinates, making the weapon accurate to within several meters, the group said.",
      "In November 2023, two journalists for Al-Mayadeen TV were killed in a drone strike at their reporting spot. A month earlier, Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon killed Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah and seriously wounded other journalists from France\u2019s international news agency Agence France-Presse and Qatar\u2019s Al-Jazeera TV on a hilltop not far from the Israeli border.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- A prominent Cambodian environmentalist was arrested along with five others while investigating illegal logging in a national park, a rights group and a government official said Sunday.",
      "Ouch Leng, who was awarded a 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize for his activism, was arrested Saturday in northeastern Stung Treng province, the rights group Licadho said in a statement.",
      "The activists have documented an increase in illegal deforestation within the Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park, located near an economic land concession, it said.",
      "The arrests come during a broader crackdown on environmental activists in recent months. In July, 10 members of a Cambodian environmental group, Mother Nature Cambodia, who campaigned against destructive infrastructure projects and alleged corruption were each sentenced to six years in prison on charges of conspiring against the state.",
      "Stung Treng provincial spokesman Men Khung confirmed Sunday by telephone that the six were arrested after they ignored instructions from authorities to leave the forestry area where no access is allowed. He said authorities were strictly guarding the site against illegal logging and land grabbing.",
      "Men Khung said several dozen armed personnel have been sent to the site to chase away illegal loggers and land grabbers and to ensure that no outsiders enter. He said that the six were not environmental activists but attempted to sow anarchy and provoke the authorities.",
      "He said that no charges had been filed against the six as of Sunday.",
      "According to Licadho, the government granted an economic land concession in the area in 2022, even though it contravened a 2012 moratorium on new concessions, which have been linked to mass evictions, rapid deforestation and extraction of resources.",

      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a message to delegates at the fifth review of the International Mine Ban Treaty, also known as the Ottawa Convention, that 25 years after it went into force some parties had renewed the use of antipersonnel mines and some are falling behind in their commitments to destroy the weapons.",
      "\u201cI call on states parties to meet their obligations and ensure compliance to the convention, while addressing humanitarian and developmental impacts through financial and technical support,\u201d Guterres said at the opening of the conference in Cambodia.",

      "\u201cPope Francis urges all states that have not yet done so to accede to the convention, and in the meantime to cease immediately the production and use of land mines,\u201d he said.",

      "In a report released last week by Landmine Monitor, the international watchdog said land mines were still actively being used in 2023 and 2024 by Russia, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea. It added that non-state armed groups in at least five places \u2014 Colombia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Gaza Strip \u2014 had used mines as well, and there were claims of their use in more than a half dozen countries in or bordering the Sahel region of Africa.",
      "At least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by land mines and unexploded ordnance last year, primarily civilians of whom a third were children, Landmine Monitor reported.",
      "Landmine Monitor said Russia had been using antipersonnel mines \u201cextensively\u201d in Ukraine, and just a week ago, the U.S., which has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout the war, announced it would start providing Kyiv with antipersonnel mines as well to try and stall Russian progress on the battlefield.",

      "Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday in an online news conference that she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives if she herself is killed, in a threat she warned was not a joke.",
      "The national police and military immediately boosted the security of the president, and the justice department said it would summon the vice president for an investigation. The National Security Council said it considered the threat a national security concern.",
      "The vice president, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks by saying it was not an actual threat but an expression of concern about her own safety over an unspecified threat.",
      "\u201cWhy would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. What\u2019s the benefit for me?\u201d Duterte told journalists.",
      "\u201cThat criminal plot should not be allowed to pass,\u201d Marcos said in a televised statement, without mentioning Duterte by name. \u201cI\u2019ll fight it.\u201d",
      "\"As a democratic country, we need to uphold the rule of law,\u201d Marcos said.",
      "Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in May 2022 elections and both won landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. In the Philippines, the two positions are elected separately.",
      "The two leaders and their camps, however, soon had a bitter falling out over key differences, including in their approaches to China\u2019s aggressive territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body.",
      "On Monday, Justice Undersecretary Jesse Andres said in a news conference that Duterte would be subpoenaed to face an investigation.",
      "Andres called the vice president the \u201cself-confessed mastermind\u201d of a \u201cpremeditated plot to assassinate the president.\u201d All government resources and law enforcement agencies would be mobilized to identify the alleged assassin and determine criminal accountability, he said.",
      "\u201cWe have to maintain order in a civilized society by adherence to the rule of law and we will apply the full strength and force of the law on this,\u201d Andres said.",
      "Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a jail term and fine.",
      "The Philippine Constitution says that if a president dies, sustains a permanent disability, is removed from office or resigns, the vice president takes over and serves the rest of the term.",
      "Duterte said she was ready to face investigators or an impeachment complaint in Congress, but added she would also demand answers to her allegations against Marcos and his allies.",
      "\u201cI will also not allow what they did to me to pass,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The vice president is the daughter of Marcos\u2019 predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drug crackdown when he was a city mayor and later president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "Like her equally outspoken father, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president\u2019s cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its supporters.",
      "Last month, the vice president told reporters her relationship with Marcos had \u201cgone so toxic\u201d that she has imagined \u201ccutting his head.",
      "Romualdez told the House of Representatives that the vice president was trying to distract attention from her alleged misuse of public funds, which Congress is investigating. Several legislators reaffirmed their trust in the House speaker and condemned Duterte's remarks.",
      "Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain Duterte's chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of Duterte's budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez has been detained in a hospital after being traumatized by a plan by legislators to temporarily detain her in prison.",
      "In a pre-dawn online news conference on Saturday, an angry Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as president and of being a liar along with his wife and the House speaker, in expletive-laden remarks.",
      "When concerns over her security were raised, Duterte, 46, suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about my security because I\u2019ve talked with somebody. I said \u2018if I\u2019m killed, you\u2019ll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,\u2019\u201d the vice president said, without elaborating and using the initials that many use to refer to the president.",
      "\"I\u2019ve given my order, \u2018If I die, don\u2019t stop until you\u2019ve killed them.\u2019 And he said, \u2019yes,\u2019\u201d the vice president said.",

      "Negotiators are gathering in South Korea in what\u2019s billed as a final push to address the global crisis of plastic pollution",
      "Negotiators gathered in Busan, South Korea, on Monday in a final push to create a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution.",
      "It's the fifth time the world's nations convene to craft a legally binding plastic pollution accord. In addition to the national delegations, representatives from the plastics industry, scientists and environmentalists have come to shape how the world tackles the surging problem.",
      "\u201cWe must end plastic pollution before plastic pollution ends us,\u201d Kim Wansup, South Korea's minister of environment, said during the opening session.",
      "The planet is \u201c choking on plastic, \u201d according to the United Nations. It's polluting lakes, rivers, oceans and people's bodies.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t kick the can, or the plastic bottle, down the road,\" U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a message aimed at negotiators.",
      "This \u201cis an issue about the intergenerational justice of those generations that will come after us and be living with all this garbage. We can solve this and we must get it done in Busan,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "The previous four global meetings have revealed sharp differences in goals and interests. This week's talks go through Saturday.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total amount of plastic on Earth by controlling design, production, consumption and where plastic ends up. The delegation from the hard-hit island nation of Micronesia helped lead an effort to call more attention to \"unsustainable\u201d plastic production, called the Bridge to Busan. Island nations are grappling with vast amounts of other countries\u2019 plastic waste washing up on their shores.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s the heart of the treaty, to go upstream and to get to the problem at its source,\u201d said Dennis Clare, legal advisor and plastics negotiator for Micronesia. \u201cThere\u2019s a tagline, \u2018You can\u2019t recycle your way out of this problem.\u2019\u201d",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, disagree. They vigorously oppose any limits on plastic manufacturing. Most plastic is made from fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of primary polypropylene, a common type of plastic, accounting for an estimated 17% of exports last year, according to the Plastics Industry Association.",
      "China, the United States and Germany led the global plastics trade by exports and imports in 2023, the association said.",
      "The plastics industry has been advocating for a treaty focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse, sometimes referred to as \u201ccircularity.\u201d Chris Jahn, International Council of Chemical Associations secretariat, said negotiators should focus on ending plastic waste in the environment, not plastic production, to get a deal. Many countries won\u2019t join a treaty if it includes production caps, he said.",
      "To continue to progress and grow as a global economy, there are going to be more plastics, Jahn added.",
      "\u201cSo we should strive then to keep those plastics in the economy and out of the environment,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "The United States delegation at first said countries should develop their own plans to act, a position viewed as favoring industry. It changed its position this summer, saying the U.S. is open to considering global targets for reductions in plastic production.",
      "Environmental groups accused the U.S. of backtracking as negotiations approached.",
      "Center for Coalfield Justice executive director Sarah Martik said the United States is standing on the sidelines rather than leading, putting \u201ctheir thumb on the scale throughout the entirety of the negotiations.\u201d She hopes this does not derail other countries\u2019 ambition.",
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution Thursday, but Martik said she thinks too many of the measures are voluntary to make a difference.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, said it's a mistake for the United States to settle for the lowest common denominator proposals, just to get some kind of agreement.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, recently proposed text for sections where he thinks the delegations could agree.",
      "The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Research published in Science this month found it is still possible to nearly end plastic pollution. The policies that make the most difference are: mandating new products be made with 40% post-consumer recycled plastic; limiting new plastic production to 2020 levels; investing significantly in plastic waste management, such as landfills and waste collection services and implementing a small fee on plastic packaging.",
      "The treaty is the only way to solve plastic pollution at this scale, said Douglas McCauley, professor at UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. McCauley co-led the research.",
      "Margaret Spring, chief conservation and science officer for Monterey Bay Aquarium, said plastic pollution used to be considered largely a waste problem. Now it is widely viewed as an existential crisis that must be addressed, said Spring, who represents the International Science Council at the negotiations.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen people\u2019s understanding of this issue move as fast, given how complex the topic is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me hope that we can actually start moving the dial.\u201d",

      "An advocate for major social media platforms has told Australia's Parliament that a plan to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed rather than being rushed to approval this week",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An advocate for major social media platforms told an Australian Senate committee Monday that laws to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed until next year at least instead of being rushed through the Parliament this week.",
      "Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week.",
      "Bose said the Parliament should wait until the government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed in June.",
      "\u201cParliament is asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,\u201d Bose said.",
      "The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties.",
      "It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users\u2019 privacy.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which \u201csupports parents to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d to children wanting to use social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media in its current form is not a safe product for them,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cAccess to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,\u201d she added.",
      "Bose received heated questions from several senators and challenges to the accuracy of her answers.",
      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",
      "She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to \u201cdarker, less safe online spaces\u201d than mainstream platforms.",
      "Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that \u201cthis could compromise the safety of young people,\u201d prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous statement. You\u2019re trying to protect the big tech giants,\u201d Henderson said.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",

      "Israel\u2019s military has killed nearly all of the militant group\u2019s top leaders, but it continues to fire missiles into Israel. Tens of thousands of Israelis who were evacuated from the border months ago are pressuring their government to go home. And the world wants to stop regional conflict from spreading after more than a year of fighting.",
      "Following the latest visit to the region by a U.S. mediator, Israel hit central Beirut over the weekend, and Hezbollah responded with its biggest barrage in weeks as each applied pressure to reach a deal.",
      "Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost daily since the day after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the war in Gaza.",
      "Israel launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon two months ago, then a ground invasion. More than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, many of them civilians.",
      "More than 70 have been killed in Israel, over 40 of them civilians. In addition, over 50 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the proposal and the sticking points.",
      "The proposal under discussion to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah calls for an initial two-month ceasefire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River.",
      "The withdrawals would be accompanied by an influx of thousands more Lebanese army troops, who have been largely sidelined in the war, to patrol the border area along with an existing U.N. peacekeeping force.",
      "An international committee would be set up to monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and of U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed in 2006 to end a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah but never fully implemented. Hezbollah never ended its presence in southern Lebanon, while Lebanon said Israel regularly violated its airspace and occupied small patches of its territory.",
      "It is not clear whether a new deal would be any more successfully implemented than the one in 2006.",
      "Michael Herzog, Israel\u2019s Ambassador to Washington, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that the deal aimed to improve surveillance and enforcement of the previous resolution. While he said there were still certain points that needed to be finalized, a deal was close and could be clinched \u201cwithin days.\u201d",
      "A U.S. official said negotiations continued to progress on Sunday, but the parties still need to work out some outstanding issues to close the deal. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks, declined declined to detail the outstanding issues.",
      "Two Western diplomats described several points of dispute to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss ongoing negotiations.",
      "They said Israel was asking for more guarantees to ensure that Hezbollah\u2019s weapons are removed from the border area. Israeli officials, concerned about the possibility of Hezbollah launching the kind of attack that Hamas carried out from Gaza into southern Israel, have said they would not agree to a ceasefire deal that doesn't explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it.",
      "An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks, said the issue remained a point of contention, although he said the talks were headed in a \u201cpositive direction.\u201d",
      "Lebanese officials have said agreeing to such a deal would violate Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem has said the militant group would not agree to a deal that does not entail a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive end to the aggression\u201d and does not protect Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "Lebanon and Israel also disagree over which countries would sit on the international committee overseeing implementation of the deal and Resolution 1701. The diplomats said Israel refused to allow France, which has remained close with Lebanon since its colonial rule there ended and has recently been at odds with Israel. The Israeli official confirmed that France's role was in dispute. Meanwhile, Lebanon has refused to allow Britain, a close ally of Israel.",
      "And Israel does not want to enter into negotiations on 13 disputed points along the border as part of a ceasefire deal, the diplomats said.",
      "The European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, who has a contentious relationship with Israel's government, said Sunday during a visit to Lebanon that he's not convinced that Israel is \u201cinterested clearly in reaching an agreement for a ceasefire.\"",
      "A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran's armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of war between Israel and Iran directly. It's not clear how it would affect the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hezbollah had long insisted that it would not agree to a ceasefire until the war in Gaza ends, but it has now dropped that condition.",
      "One diplomat said there are fears that if no ceasefire is reached, the war will expand further into Syria and Iraq as Israel attempts to cut off the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel.",
      "Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said during a visit to Damascus on Sunday that ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon are critical to \u201cavoid Syria being dragged even further into the conflict.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say Hezbollah has been weakened but continues to keep up steady fire into Israel, including strikes far from the border.",
      "On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel, wounding seven people in one of the militant group\u2019s heaviest barrages in months, in response to deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut. Violent clashes continue in southern Lebanon as Israeli forces attempt to take control of strategic towns.",
      "Israel says its goal in the war with Hezbollah is to enable displaced Israelis to safely return home. In Lebanon, a quarter the population has been displaced, and parts of the country, particularly in south Lebanon and areas south of the capital Beirut, have been destroyed.",

      "The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. But Israel\u2019s devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE.",
      "The Interior Ministry statement identified the three men as Olimpi Tohirovic, 28, Mahmoud John Abdul Rahim 28, and Azizi Kamilovic, 33. The state-run WAM news agency carried images of the three men, their faces blurred. It did not say if charges had been filed against the men.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if the three men had lawyers in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. The Uzbek Consulate in Dubai did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the arrests.",
      "Israeli media reports, citing unnamed security officials, had alleged Uzbeks were involved in Kogan's killing. Uzbeks previously have been hired in Iranian plots targeting dissidents and others.",
      "Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, has also been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. Iran\u2019s Embassy in Abu Dhabi denied Tehran was involved in the rabbi\u2019s slaying.",
      "While the UAE statement did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out past kidnappings in the UAE.",
      "Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country.",
      "Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement. Iran also kidnapped Iranian German national Jamshid Sharmahd in 2020 from Dubai, taking him back to Tehran, where he was executed in October.",
      "The Rimon Market, a kosher grocery store that Kogan managed on Dubai\u2019s busy Al Wasl Road, was shut Sunday. As the wars have roiled the region, the store has been the target of online protests by supporters of the Palestinians. Mezuzahs on the front and back doors of the market appeared to have been ripped off when an Associated Press journalist stopped by.",
      "Kogan\u2019s wife, Rivky, a U.S. citizen who lived with him in the UAE, is the niece of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was killed in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.",
      "In a statement Sunday, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett called Kogan\u2019s killing \u201ca horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance, and coexistence.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe condemn in the strongest terms the murder of Rabbi Zvi Kogan in the UAE and our prayers are with his family, the Chabad-Lubavitch community, the broader Jewish community, and all who are mourning his loss,\u201d Savett said."

      "Israel accuses Hezbollah of not adhering to a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between the sides that made similar provisions, and Israel has concerns that Hezbollah could stage a Hamas-style cross-border attack from southern Lebanon if it maintains a heavy presence there. Lebanon says Israel also violated the 2006 resolution. Lebanon complains about military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there is no active conflict.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland's conservative Law and Justice party, which is trying to regain its momentum after losing power last year, on Sunday chose historian Karol Nawrocki as its candidate for president ahead of next year's election.",
      "The decision caps a weekend during which the country's two largest parties announced their candidates for en election that will decide the successor to incumbent President Andrzej Duda, whose second and final term ends in August 2025.",
      "Nawrocki, 41, has since 2021 led the Institute of National Remembrance, a state body that houses archives and researches the crimes of World War II and the communist era. He previously served as the director of the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, the city where he was born.",
      "The party bypassed seasoned politicians including former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to tap the lesser-known Nawrocki to run for the highest office, similar to what it did in choosing Duda a decade earlier.",
      "\u201cThe party decided to field a non-partisan, independent candidate, a candidate that many of our prominent activists, including the top ones, did not know closely,\" party leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski told those gathered at a party convention in the southern city of Krakow.",
      "Had Kaczy\u0144ski tapped Morawiecki or another high-level party member who held a government role from 2015-23, it could have made the corruption scandals of that period a key focus of the campaign.",
      "Kaczy\u0144ski stated in an interview months ago that the party\u2019s presidential candidate should be \u201cyoung, tall, impressive, handsome, have a family, know English very well, and preferably two languages, and be internationally savvy.\u201d",
      "Nawrocki, giving an acceptance speech to an audience that included his wife and three children, laid out a world view that is fully in line with the party's: patriotic, pro-Christian, pro-NATO and favorable to President-elect Donald Trump.",

      "The constitutional calendar dictates that the first round of the presidential election be held on a Sunday in May 2025, though the date has not been set yet. If no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote in the first round, a runoff between the top two vote-getters will be held two weeks later.",
      "Other candidates who have announced plans to run include the parliament speaker, Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, leader of the Poland 2050 party, while the far-right Confederation party has said that its candidate will be S\u0142awomir Mentzen."

      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- Uruguay's leftist opposition candidate, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, claimed victory in a tight presidential runoff Sunday, ousting the conservative governing coalition and making the South American nation the latest to rebuke the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections.",
      "Even as the vote count continued, \u00c1lvaro Delgado, the presidential candidate of the center-right ruling coalition, conceded defeat to his challenger.",
      "\u201cWith sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,\u201d he told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo",
      "Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, thanked his supporters as crowds flocked to greet him.",
      "\u201cThe country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,\u201d he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.",
      "\u201cLet's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,\" he said. \u201cThese people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.\u201d",
      "With nearly all the votes counted, electoral officials reported that Orsi won just over 49% of the vote, ahead of Delgado\u2019s 46%. The rest cast blank votes or abstained in defiance of Uruguay's enforced compulsory voting. Turnout reached almost 90%.",
      "While failing to entice apathetic young voters, Uruguay's lackluster electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighboring Argentina.",
      "After weeks in which the moderate rivals appeared tied in the polls, Delgado's concession ushers in Orsi as Uruguay\u2019s new leader and cuts short the center-right Republican coalition's shot at governing. The 2019 election of President Luis Lacalle Pou spelled an end to 15 consecutive years of rule by the Broad Front.",
      "\u201cI called Yamand\u00fa Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country,\u201d Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X, adding that he would \u201cput myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate.\u201d",
      "Orsi's victory was the latest sign that simmering discontent over post-pandemic economic malaise favors anti-incumbent candidates. In the many elections that took place during 2024, voters frustrated with the status quo have punished ruling parties from the U.S. and Britain to South Korea and Japan.",
      "But unlike elsewhere in the world, Orsi is a moderate with no radical plans for change. He largely agrees with his opponent on key voter concerns like driving down the childhood poverty rate, now at a staggering 25%, and containing an upsurge in organized crime that has shaken the nation long considered among Latin America's safest.",
      "Despite Orsi's promise to lead a \u201cnew left\u201d in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs that characterized the Broad Front\u2019s tenure from 2005-2020.",
      "The coalition of leftist and center-left parties presided over a period of robust economic growth and pioneering social reforms that won widespread international acclaim.",
      "The driving force behind Uruguay\u2019s legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana a decade ago was former President Jos\u00e9 \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became a global icon and mentor to Orsi.",
      "Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began on Sunday to praise Orsi\u2019s humility and Uruguay\u2019s proud stability.",
      "\u201cThis is no small feat,\u201d he said of his nation's \u201ccitizenry that respects formal institutions.\u201d",
      "Specific proposals by Orsi include tax incentives to lure investment and revitalize the critical agricultural sector, as well as social security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay\u2019s unions that failed to pass in the Oct. 27 general election during which neither front-runner secured an outright majority.",
      "In keeping with the nation\u2019s reputation for being sensible, voters rejected generous pay-outs and the redistribution of privately managed pension funds in favor of fiscal constraint.",
      "He is also likely to scupper a trade agreement with China that Lacalle Pou had pursued to the chagrin of Mercosur, an alliance of South American nations promoting regional commerce.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children\u2019s,\u201d said Yeny Varone, a nurse at a polling station who voted for Orsi.\u201cIn the future they\u2019ll have better working conditions, health and salaries.\u201d",

      "With inflation easing and the economy expected to expand by some 3.2% this year, Delgado has promised to continue pursuing his predecessor\u2019s pro-business policies. Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, has enjoyed high approval ratings.",
      "But the official results trickling in Sunday showed that mounting complaints in Uruguay about years of sluggish economic growth, stagnant wages and the government\u2019s struggle to contain crime after five years helped swing the election against Delgado.",
      "Still, Orsi struck a conciliatory tone.",

Authorities also banned outsiders, social organizations and public representatives from entering the city without official permission until Nov. 30, Singh said, as the government scrambled to contain the unrest.",
      "What began as a standoff escalated into clashes when protesters threw stones at police, who responded by deploying tear gas, police said.",
      "\u201cSome miscreants in the crowd resorted to violence, forcing us to use minor force and tear gas to restore order,\u201d said Krishna Kumar Vishnoi, a local police officer.",
      "Videos circulating on social media showed scenes of stone-pelting and vehicles engulfed in flames as police used firearms.",
      "Despite the unrest, the survey proceeded as planned.",
      "As authorities brace for potential fallout, the incident has reignited tensions over religious disputes in India where historical grievances often fuel contemporary conflicts.",
      "Hindu activist groups, mostly linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling party, have claimed that several mosques in India were built over Hindu temples centuries ago during the Muslim Mughal empire.",
      "Experts say Hindu nationalists have been emboldened after Modi earlier this year inaugurated a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a centuries-old mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya, in a political triumph for the populist leader who is seeking to transform the country from a secular democracy into a Hindu state.",
      "The petitioner in Sambhal cites historical texts that the mosque was constructed over a Hindu temple allegedly destroyed by Mughal emperor Babur in 1529. The proponents of the survey argue it seeks to uncover historical truths while opponents condemn it as a violation of the Places of Worship Act, 1991, which maintains the religious status quo of sites as they were in 1947.",

      "Iraq\u2019s prime minister says the country's population has grown to 45.4 million, according to preliminary results from a national census, the first in nearly 40 years",
      "BAGHDAD -- Preliminary results from an Iraqi national census, the first in nearly 40 years, show that the population has grown to 45.4 million, the prime minister said on Monday.",
      "The nationwide population census, carried out earlier this month, is a step aimed at modernizing data collection and planning in a country long impacted by conflict and political divisions.",
      "Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said on Monday that initial results showed the country\u2019s population has reached approximately 45.4 million people. In 2009, an unofficial count estimated the population at 31.6 million.",
      "The gender distribution according to Monday's initial results shows a nearly even split, with males making up 50.1% of the population and females 49.8% of the population.",
      "The act of counting the population, the first in 37 years, is contentious in Iraq, with profound implications for the country\u2019s resource distribution, budget allocations and development planning. Minority groups also fear that a documented decline in their numbers will bring decreased political influence and fewer economic benefits in the country\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system.",
      "By order of Iraq\u2019s federal court, the census excluded questions about ethnicity and sectarian affiliation, focusing solely on broad religious categories such as Muslim and Christian.",
      "The last nationwide census in Iraq was held in 1987. Another one held in 1997 excluded the Kurdish region.",
      "The next phase of the census will run over the coming weeks before final results, which will include information on religious groups, are announced, according to Ali Arian Saleh, the executive director of the census at the Ministry of Planning.",
      "The census was the first to employ advanced technologies for gathering and analyzing data, providing a comprehensive picture of Iraq\u2019s demographic, social, and economic landscape, officials said. Some 120,000 census workers surveyed households across the country, covering approximately 160 housing units each over two days."

    "summary": "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has big plans for the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has big plans for the economy \u2014 and a big debt problem that will be a hurdle to delivering on them.",
      "Trump has bold ideas on tax cuts, tariffs and other programs, but high interest rates and the price of repaying the federal government\u2019s existing debt could limit what he\u2019s able to do.",
      "Not only is the federal debt at roughly $36 trillion, but the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government's borrowing costs such that debt service next year will easily exceed spending on national security.",
      "The higher cost of servicing the debt gives Trump less room to maneuver with the federal budget as he seeks income tax cuts. It's also a political challenge because higher interest rates have made it costlier for many Americans to buy a home or new automobile. And the issue of high costs helped Trump reclaim the presidency in November's election.",
      "\u201cIt's clear the current amount of debt is putting upward pressure on interest rates, including mortgage rates for instance,\" said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThe cost of housing and groceries is going to be increasingly felt by households in a way that are going to adversely affect our economic prospects in the future.\u201d",
      "Akabas stressed that the debt service is already starting to crowd out government spending on basic needs such as infrastructure and education. About 1 in 5 dollars spent by the government are now repaying investors for borrowed money, instead of enabling investments in future economic growth.",
      "It's an issue on Trump's radar. In his statement on choosing billionaire investor Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary, the Republican president-elect said Bessent would \u201chelp curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt.\u201d",
      "The debt service costs along with the higher total debt complicate Trump's efforts to renew his 2017 tax cuts, much of which are set to expire after next year. The higher debt from those tax cuts could push interest rates higher, making debt service even costlier and minimizing any benefits the tax cuts could produce for growth.",
      "\u201cClearly, it's irresponsible to run back the same tax cuts after the deficit has tripled,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former Republican congressional aide. \u201cEven congressional Republicans behind the scenes are looking for ways to scale down the president\u2019s ambitions.\u201d",
      "Democrats and many economists say Trump's income tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which deprives the government of revenues needed for programs for the middle class and poor.",
      "\"The president-elect\u2019s tax policy ideas will increase the deficit because they will decrease taxes for those with the highest ability to pay, such as the corporations whose tax rate he\u2019s proposed reducing even further to 15%,\u201d said Jessica Fulton, vice president of policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that deals with issues facing communities of color.",
      "Trump's team insists he can make the math work.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering prices. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump transition spokeswoman.",
      "When Trump was last in the White House in 2020, the federal government was spending $345 billion annually to service the national debt. It was possible to run up the national debt with tax cuts and pandemic aid because the average interest rate was low, such that repayment costs were manageable even as debt levels climbed.",
      "Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that debt service costs next year could exceed $1 trillion. That's more than projected spending on defense. The total is also greater than nondefense spending on infrastructure, food aid and other programs under the direction of Congress.",
      "What fueled the increased cost of servicing the debt has been higher interest rates. In April 2020, when the government was borrowing trillions of dollars to address the pandemic, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as low as 0.6%. They're now 4.4%, having increasing since September as investors expect Trump to add several trillions of dollars onto projected deficits with his income tax cuts.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden can point to strong economic growth and successfully avoiding a recession as the Federal Reserve sought to bring down inflation. Still, deficits ran at unusually high levels during his term. That's due in part to his own initiatives to boost manufacturing and address climate change, and to the legacy of Trump's previous tax cuts.",
      "People in Trump's orbit, as well as Republican lawmakers, are already scouting out ways to reduce government spending in order to minimize the debt and bring down interest rates. They have attacked Biden for the deficits and inflation, setting the stage for whether they can persuade Trump to take action.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy businessmen leading Trump's efforts to cut government costs, have proposed that the incoming administration should simply refuse to spend some of the money approved by Congress. It's an idea that Trump has also backed, but one that would likely provoke challenges in court as it would undermine congressional authority.",
      "Russell Vought, the White House budget director during Trump's first term and Trump's choice to lead it again, put out an alternative proposed budget for 2023 with more than $11 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in order to potentially generate a surplus.",
      "Michael Faulkender, a finance professor who served in Trump's Treasury Department, told a congressional committee in March that all the energy and environmental components of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 should be repealed to reduce deficits.",
      "Trump has also talked up tariffs on imports to generate revenues and reduce deficits, while some Republican lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, have discussed adding work requirements to trim Medicaid expenses.",
      "The White House was last pressured by high rates to address debt service costs roughly three decades ago during the start of Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency. Higher yields on the 10-year Treasury notes led Clinton and Congress to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, ultimately producing a budget surplus starting in 1998.",
      "Clinton political adviser James Carville joked at the time about how bond investors pushing up borrowing rates for the U.S. government could humble the commander in chief.",
      "\u201cI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter,\" Carville said. \"But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\u201d"

      "A spate of iconic rebrands in recent weeks have left some people reeling in a consumerist society where what we buy says a lot about who we are",
      "LONDON -- When Katja Vogt considers a Jaguar, she pictures a British-made car purring confidently along the Italian coastline \u2014 a vision of familiarity that conveys \u201cthat dreaming, longing feeling we all love.\u201d",
      "She's not sure what to think about Jaguar now after the 89-year-old company announced a radical rebranding this week that featured loud colors and androgynous people \u2014 but no cars. Jaguar, the company says, will now be JaGUar. It will produce only electric vehicles beginning in 2026.",
      "And say goodbye to British racing green, Cotswold Blue and black. Its colors are henceforth electric pink, red and yellow, according to a video that has received backlash online. Its mission statement: \u201cCreate exuberance. Live vivid. Delete ordinary. Break moulds.\u201d",
      "\u201cIntrigued?\u201d @Jaguar posted on social media. \"Weird and unsettled\u201d is more like it, Vogt wrote on Instagram.",
      "\u201cEspecially now, with the world feeling so dystopian,\" the Cyprus-based brand designer wrote, \"a heritage brand like Jaguar should be conveying feelings of safety, stability, and maybe a hint of rebellion \u2014 the kind that shakes things up in a good way, not in a way that unsettles.\u201d",
      "Jaguar, a sturdy symbol of British tradition and refinement, was one of several iconic companies that announced significant rebrandings in recent weeks, upending a series of commercial \u2014 and, yes, cultural \u2014 landmarks by which many modern human beings sort each other, carve out identities and recognize the world around them.",
      "Campbell's, the soupy, 155-year-old American icon immortalized in pop culture decades ago by Andy Warhol, is ready for a new, soupless name. Comcast\u2019s corporate reorganization means that there will soon be two television networks with \u201cNBC\u201d in their name \u2014 CNBC and MSNBC \u2014 that will no longer have any corporate connection to NBC News, a U.S. legacy news outlet.",
      "One could even argue that the United States itself is rebranding a bit with the election this month of former President Donald Trump and Republican majorities in the House and Senate in a divided nation. Unlike Trump's first election in 2016, he won the popular vote in what many called a national referendum on American identity.",
      "Are we, then, the sum total of our consumer decisions \u2014 what we buy, where we travel and whom we elect?",
      "Certainly, it's a question for those privileged enough to be able to afford such choices. But volumes of research in the art and science of branding \u2014 from \u201cbrandr,\u201d an old Norse word for burning symbols into the hides of livestock \u2014 say those factors do contribute to the modern sense of identity. So rebranding, especially of heritage names, can be a deeply felt affront to consumers.",
      "\u201cIt can feel like the brand is turning its back on everything that it stood for \u2014 and therefore it feels like its turning its back on us, the people who subscribe to that idea or ideology,\u201d said Ali Marmaduke, strategy director with the Amsterdam-based Brand Potential.",
      "He said cultural tension \u2014 polarization \u2014 in 2024 is surging over politics, wars in Russia and the Mideast, the environment, public health and more, creating what Marmaduke said is known as a \u201cpolycrisis:\u201d the idea that there are several massive crises converging and that feel scary and complex.",
      "\u201cPeople are understandably freaked out by that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are looking for something that will help us navigate this changing, threatening world that we face.\u201d",
      "Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d qualifies. So did President Joe Biden's \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d slogan atop his legislative plan. And Campbell's soup itself \u2014 \u201cMmm Mmm Good\u201d \u2014 isn't going anywhere, its CEO, Mark Clouse, said in a statement. The company's new name, Campbell\u2019s Co., will reflect \u201cthe full breadth of our portfolio,\u201d which for some time has included brands like Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish crackers.",
      "None of the recent activity around heritage brands has sparked a backlash as ferocious as Jaguar's. It's a company that has stood as a pillar of tradition-loving British identity since World War II.",
      "The rebrand, which includes a new logo, is slated to launch Dec. 2 during Miami Art Week, when the company will unveil a new electric GT model. Jaguar said in its press release that its approach was rooted in the philosophy of its founder, Sir William Lyons, to \u201ccopy nothing.\u201d",
      "What it's calling \u201cthe new Jaguar\u201d will overhaul everything from the font of its name to the positioning of it's famous \u201cleaper\u201d cat. \u201cExuberant modernism\u201d will \u201cdefine all aspects of the new Jaguar world,\u201d according to the press release. The approach is thought to be aimed at selling fewer cars at a six-figure price point to a more diverse customer base.",
      "The reaction, though, ranged from bewilderment to hostility. Memes sprouted up likening the video to the Teletubbies, a Benetton ad and \u2014 perhaps predictably \u2014 a bow to \u201cwoke\u201d culture as the blowback intersected with politics.",
      "\u201cGrace. Space. Pace. That\u2019s what you are supposed to be about,\" tweeted @JonnyHorsepower. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell this ad (?) is about.\u201d Replied @Jaguar, cryptically: \u201cThese are our Strikethroughs. Deliberate, graphical and linear.\u201d",
      "A Spectator headline declared that the Jaguar rebrand is \u201cdoomed\u201d and that it had \u201ckilled a British icon.\u201d But wait: \u201cWhat if the rebrand turns out to be just a huge mockery of \u2018woke\u2019 rebrands?\u201d wondered Bennie1289 on Reddit.",
      "Marketing and branding designers pointed out that any rebrand should, at least, be easy for consumers to remember and understand. JaGUar stumbled over that test on Day 1.",
      "\u201cCorrection, November 19th,\u201d read a blurb under an article in The Verge. \u201cA previous version of this article said only the \u2018G\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 letters in Jaguar are upper case. The \u2018J\u2019 is also upper case.\u201d",

      "The Justice Department and Google are set to make closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google are scheduled to make closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market: A technology called \u201cDoubleClick\u201d is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls only 25% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",
      "Google also says it has invested billions in technology that facilitates the efficient match of advertisers to interested consumers and it should not be forced to share its technology and success with competitors.",
      "\u201cRequiring a company to do further engineering work to make its technology and customers accessible by all of its competitors on their preferred terms has never been compelled by U.S. antitrust law,\u201d the company wrote.",
      "The Virginia case is separate from an ongoing lawsuit brought against Google in the District of Columbia over its namesake search engine. In that case, the judge determined the search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly but has not decided what remedy to impose.",
      "The Justice Department said last week it will seek to force Google to sell its Chrome Web browser, among a host of other penalties. Google has said the department's request is overkill and unhinged from legitimate regulation."

      "PARIS -- French far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Monday that she could bring down France's minority government by the end of the year unless changes are made to the country's budget bill.",
      "Le Pen made her remarks after a meeting with conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier over next year's budget and other issues. Barnier was to meet with other political leaders from the left and the center later in the day.",
      "Le Pen said lawmakers from her National Rally party, including herself, would bring a confidence motion if the bill now being debated in parliament \u201cstays as it is.\u201d",
      "Le Pen said she expressed \u201cred lines,\" including a refusal to raise electricity taxes and the need to increase state pensions from January.",
      "Barnier's Cabinet is forced to rely on the far right\u2019s good will to be able to stay in power. The budget bill for next year must be passed by Dec. 21.",
      "\u201cWe said what were the nonnegotiable elements for us,\" Le Pen said. \u201cWe are straight in our political approach. We defend the French people.\u201d",
      "Following the June-July parliamentary elections, the National Assembly, France\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, is divided into three major blocs: a left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, Macron\u2019s centrist allies and the far-right National Rally party. None of them won an outright majority.",
      "Barnier\u2019s Cabinet is mostly composed of members of his Republicans party and centrists from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s alliance, who altogether count just over 210 lawmakers out of 577.",
      "France is under pressure from the European Union\u2019s executive body to reduce its colossal debt. Barnier's Cabinet seeks to reduce France\u2019s deficit from an estimated 6% of Gross Domestic Product now to 5% next year through a 60 billion ($66 billion) budget squeeze.",
      "Last month, the government survived a confidence vote brought by the left-wing coalition because the far-right group abstained from voting.",
      "Le Pen's comments come as she and other National Rally officials are on trial in Paris over the suspected embezzlement of European Parliament funds. Paris prosecutors requested a 2-year prison sentence for her, along with a 5-year period of ineligibility to run for office."

      "A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea",
      "A last round of negotiations on a legally binding treaty to address the global scourge of plastic pollution has opened in Busan, South Korea. Here's what to know about it:",
      "National delegations still have a lot to hammer out before there is a treaty. Most contentious is whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total plastic on Earth by controlling plastic design, production, consumption and what happens at the end of its life.",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, vigorously oppose such limits.",
      "Global plastics production is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, up 70% from 2020, without policy changes, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.",
      "Negotiators must also decide whether the treaty will reduce or eliminate single-use plastics. They'll have to resolve whether to end the use of hazardous chemicals in plastics and whether these steps will be mandated or merely encouraged.",
      "Their common objective is to protect human health and the environment.",
      "There are some things many countries agree on. They want provisions in a treaty to promote the redesign of plastic products so they can be recycled and reused. They want to invest to better manage plastic waste. They want to increase recycling rates and help waste pickers transition to safer jobs. There is agreement that there needs to be a mechanism to help countries pay for anything required of them.",
      "Graham Forbes, who is leading a Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said his group could support an agreement that puts sensible guardrails in place to reduce the amount of plastic produced, eliminates toxic chemicals and protects people from the uncontrolled use of plastics. That's achievable, but will take political leadership and courage not seen yet in earlier negotiations, he added.",
      "Frankie Orona, executive director of the Texas-based Society of Native Nations, said they demand a treaty that tackles the root causes of the crisis rather than just managing plastic waste.",
      "\u201cWe must seize this moment and leave a legacy we can be proud of, with a non-toxic sustainable future for all children and our children's children,\" he said.",
      "Industry leaders want an agreement that prevents plastic pollution by redesigning plastics to be reused, recycled and remade into new products. They say this will keep the materials in circulation and out of the environment.",
      "Company executives said they'll support a treaty that recognizes plastics' benefits to society, while ending pollution.",
      "\u201cI would hate to miss this opportunity because we get fixated on issues that divide us rather than unite us in this purpose of ultimately addressing the issue of plastic pollution,\" said Steve Prusak, president and CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company. \"It\u2019s a really critical time. We\u2019re really hopeful that what we get out of the meetings will lead to practical, implementable policies and harmonization across the globe.\u201d",

    "title": "Nigeria turns to natural gas as transport prices soar after petrol subsidies were removed",
    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 06:10:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa&rsquo;s most populous country",
    "story": [
      "Nigeria faces its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation after the government ended costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa\u2019s most populous country",
      "ABUJA, Nigeria -- When Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu ended the costly subsidies that made petrol affordable for many in Africa's most populous country, Ahmed Halilu knew his e-hailing cab business in the capital, Abuja, was about to run into huge losses.",
      "Transportation costs skyrocketed as the price of petrol more than tripled in the months that followed last year's decision, resulting in the country\u2019s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. That meant a massive drop in the number of Halilu's passengers and ultimately in his earnings.",
      "In what they said would eventually lower transportation costs by almost 50%, Nigerian authorities in August introduced a compressed natural gas (CNG) initiative to tap its huge gas reserves \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest \u2014 and roll out CNG buses while switching petrol-powered vehicles to use it.",
      "More than 100,000 vehicles have been adapted to run on CNG or with the hybrid option of CNG and petrol, and at least $200 million has been invested by the government under the initiative, according to its director, Michael Oluwagbemi.",
      "The government aims to convert 1 million of Nigeria's over 11 million vehicles in the next three years, but analysts say the process has been slow, pointing to poor implementation and limited infrastructure.",
      "Although Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s top oil producers, it depends on imported refined petroleum products because its refineries are struggling, with production at its lowest in decades amid massive oil theft.",
      "Together with other reforms introduced by Tinubu after coming to power in May last year, the removal of subsidies was supposed to save the government money and shore up dwindling foreign investments.",
      "However, it has affected the price of just about everything, and soaring transportation costs force people to abandon their vehicles and walk to work.",
      "Switching over to gas is hard. In addition to the lack of an adequate network of CNG conversion and filling stations \u2014 available in 13 of Nigeria's 36 states \u2014 the success of the government's initiative also has been limited by low public awareness.",
      "That has left room for misinformation and hesitancy among drivers.",
      "\u201cPeople are not keen about it because of a lack of orientation,\" Halilu said. He converted his vehicle and now saves $240 monthly on petrol costs in his e-hailing business.",
      "Some drivers have expressed fear that their cars could explode with the CNG conversion \u2014 claims that regulatory agencies have said are untrue unless the equipment is installed inappropriately. In southern Edo state, authorities found that a CNG-powered vehicle that exploded had been worked on by an unaccredited vendor.",
      "Even in Abuja and the economic hub of Lagos, filling stations are scarce and the few available conversion workshops are often lined with commercial vehicles waiting for days to switch to CNG at subsidized rates.",
      "Meanwhile, the cost for private vehicles to switch is 20 times Nigeria\u2019s minimum monthly wage of $42.",
      "A colleague had to travel about 200 kilometers (124 miles) to Abuja to refill his cylinder, said Abdul Manasseh, an e-hailing taxi driver in Abuja.",
      "Another challenge that has slowed the initiative is Nigeria\u2019s limited gas pipeline, which makes supplying stations difficult. As a result, most parts of the northern and eastern states have not been reached.",
      "The challenges echo those for the shift to electric vehicles in Nigeria, where the adoption by private operators has been slow. The power supply remains fitful for most of the country\u2019s 210 million citizens, mainly as a result of underinvestment and vandalism.",
      "The government understands there is still \u201ca lot of uncertainty\u201d around the CNG initiative and is working to correct the misconceptions and provide the needed infrastructure, said Tosin Coker, the initiative's head of commercial matters.",
      "\u201cCNG is a cleaner fuel, it is a cheaper fuel and it is a safer fuel compared to the petrol that we are used to,\" Coker said. \u201cSo you will have more money in your pocket and it's cleaner for the environment.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,\u201d the post said.",
      "Dotcom\u2019s lawyer, Ira Rothken, confirmed to The Associated Press that the contents of the statement were accurate. Rothken would not say whether Dotcom or someone else wrote the post and did not provide further details.",
      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer.",
      "Dotcom did not say in Monday\u2019s statement when he suffered the stroke. Usually a prolific X user, the internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6."

      "\u201cDon\u2019t kick the can, or the plastic bottle, down the road,\" U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said in a message aimed at negotiators.",
      "This \u201cis an issue about the intergenerational justice of those generations that will come after us and be living with all this garbage. We can solve this and we must get it done in Busan,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "The previous four global meetings have revealed sharp differences in goals and interests. This week's talks go through Saturday.",
      "Led by Norway and Rwanda, 66 countries plus the European Union say they want to address the total amount of plastic on Earth by controlling design, production, consumption and where plastic ends up. The delegation from the hard-hit island nation of Micronesia helped lead an effort to call more attention to \"unsustainable\u201d plastic production, called the Bridge to Busan. Island nations are grappling with vast amounts of other countries\u2019 plastic waste washing up on their shores.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s the heart of the treaty, to go upstream and to get to the problem at its source,\u201d said Dennis Clare, legal advisor and plastics negotiator for Micronesia. \u201cThere\u2019s a tagline, \u2018You can\u2019t recycle your way out of this problem.\u2019\u201d",
      "Some plastic-producing and oil and gas countries, including Saudi Arabia, disagree. They vigorously oppose any limits on plastic manufacturing. Most plastic is made from fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of primary polypropylene, a common type of plastic, accounting for an estimated 17% of exports last year, according to the Plastics Industry Association.",
      "China, the United States and Germany led the global plastics trade by exports and imports in 2023, the association said.",
      "The plastics industry has been advocating for a treaty focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse, sometimes referred to as \u201ccircularity.\u201d Chris Jahn, International Council of Chemical Associations secretariat, said negotiators should focus on ending plastic waste in the environment, not plastic production, to get a deal. Many countries won\u2019t join a treaty if it includes production caps, he said.",
      "To continue to progress and grow as a global economy, there are going to be more plastics, Jahn added.",
      "\u201cSo we should strive then to keep those plastics in the economy and out of the environment,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "The United States delegation at first said countries should develop their own plans to act, a position viewed as favoring industry. It changed its position this summer, saying the U.S. is open to considering global targets for reductions in plastic production.",
      "Environmental groups accused the U.S. of backtracking as negotiations approached.",
      "Center for Coalfield Justice executive director Sarah Martik said the United States is standing on the sidelines rather than leading, putting \u201ctheir thumb on the scale throughout the entirety of the negotiations.\u201d She hopes this does not derail other countries\u2019 ambition.",
      "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a national strategy to prevent plastic pollution Thursday, but Martik said she thinks too many of the measures are voluntary to make a difference.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, said it's a mistake for the United States to settle for the lowest common denominator proposals, just to get some kind of agreement.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the committee chair from Ecuador, recently proposed text for sections where he thinks the delegations could agree.",

      "Research published in Science this month found it is still possible to nearly end plastic pollution. The policies that make the most difference are: mandating new products be made with 40% post-consumer recycled plastic; limiting new plastic production to 2020 levels; investing significantly in plastic waste management, such as landfills and waste collection services and implementing a small fee on plastic packaging.",
      "The treaty is the only way to solve plastic pollution at this scale, said Douglas McCauley, professor at UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. McCauley co-led the research.",

      "A bankruptcy judge is set to hear arguments Monday in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones \u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with him.",
      "It's not clear how soon U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will issue a ruling. He could allow The Onion to move forward with the sale, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Regardless, Jones has set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts that would allow him keep airing his show. And his personal account with 3.3 million followers on the social platform X was not part of the sale, although Lopez will be deciding whether it should be included in the liquidation and sold off later.",
      "Jones' bankruptcy and the liquidation of his assets came about after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones was found liable for defamation and emotional distress damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas for repeatedly calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Jones alleged The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of those families, the humor site and a court-appointed trustee who is overseeing the liquidation.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected among the sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account.",
      "In a court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "But at a Nov. 14 hearing Lopez said he was concerned about the process and transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Jones has brought in millions of dollars a year in revenue by hawking nutritional supplements, clothing, survival gear and other merchandise \u2014 including more than $22 million this year through Sept. 30 from his Infowars Store website, according to court documents.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court earlier this year said Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Employees of ABM and Prospect Airport Services cast ballots Friday to authorize the work stoppage in North Carolina, which a spokesperson said began Monday morning.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re on strike today because this is our last resort. We can\u2019t keep living like this,\u201d ABM cabin cleaner Priscilla Hoyle said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re taking action because our families can\u2019t survive.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of supporters of India\u2019s main opposition party have protested against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the U.S. for alleged fraud and bribery, and accused the government of protecting the Indian coal magnate whose compani...",
      "NEW DELHI -- Hundreds of supporters of India's main opposition party protested on Monday against billionaire Gautam Adani, who was recently indicted in the U.S. for alleged fraud and bribery, and accused the government of protecting the Indian coal magnate whose companies' shares have plunged since the charges last week.",
      "Activists belonging to the Congress party demonstrated near Parliament in New Delhi to demand the immediate arrest of Adani, who is seen as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some held up placards reading \u201cModi and Adani are one\u201d and \u201cModi's friendship is costing the nation.\" Several were detained by police.",
      "Also on Monday, opposition parties attempted to raise the Adani allegations in Parliament, but the session was adjourned over disruptions. They called for a joint committee to investigate his companies, which include agriculture, renewable energy, coal and infrastructure.",
      "Adani, 62, one of Asia's richest men, was thrust into the spotlight last week when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, alleging that Adani duped investors in a massive solar project in India by concealing that it was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in India.",
      "The government has not officially commented on the charges, which the Adani group has denied as baseless. On Saturday, the group's CFO said the indictment was linked to one contract of Adani Green, its renewable energy arm, that comprised 10% of its business, adding that none of the group's other companies was accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Ishita Sadha, part of the Congress party\u2019s youth wing, said the allegations were embarrassing for India. \u201cModi is keeping Adani safe,\u201d she said.",
      "After the indictment was unsealed last week, the Congress party's Rahul Gandhi said the Modi government was protecting Adani and that the billionaire wouldn't be arrested or investigated. \u201cThe prime minister's credibility has been destroyed. The entire country knows they (Adani and Modi) are one. We will expose the entire network,\u201d Gandhi told reporters.",
      "The main opposition bloc, called INDIA, led by the Congress party, has repeatedly called for investigations into Adani. They have hit out at the tycoon and his perceived links to the government since a U.S.-based short-selling firm released a report last year accusing the billionaire\u2019s companies of stock price manipulation and fraud.",
      "Adani denied those claims too, but the report triggered the selling of his companies\u2019 stock and an ongoing investigation by the country\u2019s market regulator. Market analysts say Adani had just about recovered from the shock from the report when the charges were announced, making it the biggest test yet for the beleaguered billionaire. A day after the indictment, his companies\u2019 stocks plunged up to 20%.",
      "Adani\u2019s imprint across India\u2019s economy runs deep. His group is the country\u2019s largest operator of coal mines and largest infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employs tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world\u2019s largest player in renewable energy by 2030.",
      "Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group\u2019s priorities with those of the Modi government. His critics accuse him of crony capitalism and of gaining preferential treatment from the government, including in winning contracts, which the group has denied."

      "An advocate for major social media platforms has told Australia's Parliament that a plan to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed rather than being rushed to approval this week",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An advocate for major social media platforms told an Australian Senate committee Monday that laws to ban children younger than 16 from the sites should be delayed until next year at least instead of being rushed through the Parliament this week.",
      "Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week.",
      "Bose said the Parliament should wait until the government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed in June.",
      "\u201cParliament is asked to pass a bill this week without knowing how it will work,\u201d Bose said.",
      "The legislation would impose fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) on platforms for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "It seems likely to be passed by Parliament by Thursday with the support of the major parties.",
      "It would take effect a year after the bill becomes law, allowing the platforms time to work out technological solutions that would also protect users\u2019 privacy.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said she looked forward to reading the Senate committee's assessment of the proposed law, which \u201csupports parents to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d to children wanting to use social media.",
      "\u201cSocial media in its current form is not a safe product for them,\u201d Rowland told Parliament.",
      "\u201cAccess to social media does not have to be the defining feature of growing up. There is more to life than constant notifications, endless scrolling and pressure to conform to the false and unrealistic perfectionism that can be served up by influencers,\u201d she added.",
      "Bose received heated questions from several senators and challenges to the accuracy of her answers.",
      "Opposition Sen. Ross Cadell asked how his 10-year-old stepson was able to hold Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube accounts from the age of 8, despite the platforms setting a nominal age limit of 13.",
      "Bose replied that \u201cthis is an area where the industry needs to improve.\u201d",
      "She said the proposed social media ban risked isolating some children and driving children to \u201cdarker, less safe online spaces\u201d than mainstream platforms.",
      "Bose said her concern with the proposed law was that \u201cthis could compromise the safety of young people,\u201d prompting a hostile response from opposition Sen. Sarah Henderson.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an outrageous statement. You\u2019re trying to protect the big tech giants,\u201d Henderson said.",
      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",
      "\u201cWe need to see continued investment in algorithms and ensuring that they do a better job at addressing harmful content,\u201d Bose said.",
      "Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn\u2019t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children.",
      "She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022.",
      "Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings.",
      "Department Deputy Secretary James Chisholm said officials had consulted widely before proposing the age limit.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s a good idea and it can be done,\u201d Chisholm told the committee."

    "story": [
      "\u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d have debuted in theaters with a combined $270 million in ticket sales",
      "NEW YORK -- With a combined $270 million in worldwide ticket sales, \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d breathed fresh life into a box office that has struggled lately, leading to one of the busiest moviegoing weekends of the year.",
      "Jon M. Chu\u2019s lavish big-budget musical \u201cWicked,\u201d starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, debuted with $114 million domestically and $164.2 million globally for Universal Pictures, according to studio estimates Sunday. That made it the third-biggest opening weekend of the year, behind only \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a record for a Broadway musical adaptation.",
      "Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d a sequel to his 2000 best picture-winning original, launched with $55.5 million in ticket sales. With a price tag of around $250 million to produce it, \u201cGladiator II\u201d was a big bet by Paramount Pictures to return to the Colosseum with a largely new cast, led by Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal. While it opened with a touch less than the $60 million predicted in domestic ticket sales, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has performed well overseas. It added $50.5 million internationally.",
      "The collision of the two movies led to some echoes of the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d effect of last year, when \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d launched simultaneously. The nickname this time, \u201cGlicked,\u201d wasn\u2019t quite as catchy and the cultural imprint also was notably less. Few people sought out a double feature this time. The domestic grosses in 2023 \u2014 $162 million for \u201cBarbie\u201d and $82 million for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 also were higher.",
      "For Universal, which distributed \u201cOppenheimer\" last year, the weekend was more a triumph of \u201cWicked\" than it was of \u201cGlicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw an opportunity to dominate a weekend and get a very large running start into the Thanksgiving holiday,\" said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \"We're very confident that it will play ridiculously well through the Christmas corridor and into the new year.\u201d",
      "But the counter-programming effect was still potent for \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d which likewise split broadly along gender lines. And it was again the female-leaning release \u2014 \u201cWicked,\u201d like \u201cBarbie\u201d before it \u2014 that easily won the weekend. About 72% of ticket buyers for \u201cWicked\u201d were female, while 61% of those seeing \u201cGladiator II\u201d were male.",
      "\u201cStanding on their own, each of these movies may have done pretty much what they did, but it\u2019s hard to know,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cRaising awareness can indeed lead to an increase in box office. Let\u2019s put it this way: They didn\u2019t hurt each other at all.\u201d",
      "While \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d benefitted enormously from meme-spread word-of-mouth, both \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d leaned on all-out marketing blitzes.",
      "The \u201cGladiator II\u201d campaign featured everything from a much-debated Airbnb cross-promotion with the actual Colosseum in Rome to simultaneously running a one-minute trailer on more than 4,000 TV networks, radio station and digital platforms.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d onslaught went even further, with pink and green themed \u201cWickedly Delicious\u201d Starbucks drinks, Stanley mugs and Mattel dolls (some of which led to an awkward recall ). Its stars made appearances at the Met Gala and the Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe had roughly 400 global brand partners on \u2018Wicked,\u2019 so the campaign was inescapable, said Orr. \u201cAnd our cast, led by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, worked so hard on this. They were everywhere. They did everything we asked them to do.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend, box office was down about 11% from last year and some 25% from pre-pandemic times. That meant this week's two headline films led a much-needed resurgence for theaters. With \u201cMoana 2\u201d releasing Wednesday, Hollywood might be looking at historic sales over the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "\u201cThis weekend\u2019s two strong openers are invigorating a box office that fell apart after a good summer,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.",
      "Though \u201cWicked\u201d will face some direct competition from \u201cMoana 2,\u201d it would seem better set up for a long and lucrative run in theaters than \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Though some have dinged \u201cWicked\u201d for running long, at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the film has had mostly stellar reviews. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore. The reception for \u201cWicked\u201d has been strong enough that Oscar prognosticators expect it to be a contender for best picture at the Academy Awards, among other categories.",
      "Producers, perhaps sensing a hit, also took the step of splitting \u201cWicked\u201d in two. Part two, already filmed, is due out next November. Each \u201cWicked\u201d installation cost around $150 million to make.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d has also enjoyed good reviews, particularly for Washington's charismatic performance. Audience scores, though, were weaker, with ticket buyers giving it a \u201cB\u201d on CinemaScore. The film will make up for some of that, however, with robust international sales. It launched in many overseas markets a week ago, and has already accrued $165.5 million internationally.",
      "Coming in a distant third place for the weekend was \u201cRed One,\u201d the Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans holiday movie turned action film. In its second week of release, the Amazon MGM Studios release grossed $13.3 million to bring its two-week global haul to $117 million. At a cost of $250 million to make, \u201cRed One\u201d is the season's biggest flop, though it could recoup some value for Amazon if it's more popular once it begins streaming.",

    "story": [
      "The last meatpackers in New York's Meatpacking District have agreed to end their leases early and make way for development on their city-owned lot",
      "NEW YORK -- When John Jobbagy\u2019s grandfather immigrated from Budapest in 1900, he joined a throng of European butchers chopping up and shipping off meat in a loud, smelly corner of Manhattan that New Yorkers called the Meatpacking District.",
      "Today only a handful of meatpackers remain, and they're preparing to say goodbye to a very different neighborhood, known more for its high-end boutiques and expensive restaurants than the industry that gave it its name.",
      "Jobbagy and the other tenants in the district\u2019s last meat market have accepted a deal from the city to move out so the building can be redeveloped, the culmination of a decades-long transformation.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood I grew up in is just all memories,\u201d said Jobbagy, 68. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone for over 20 years.\u201d",
      "In its heyday, it was a gritty hub of over 200 slaughterhouses and packing plants at the intersection of shipping and train lines, where meat and poultry were unloaded, cut and moved quickly to markets. Now the docks are recreation areas and an abandoned freight line is the High Line park. The Whitney Museum of American Art moved from Madison Avenue next to Jobbagy's meat company in 2015.",
      "Some of the new retailers maintain reminders of the neighborhood\u2019s meat-packing past. At the exposed brick entrance to an outlet of fashion brand Rag & Bone, which sells $300 leather belts, is a carefully restored sign from a previous occupant, \u201cDave\u2019s Quality Veal,\u201d in red and white hand-painted lettering.",
      "Another sign for a wholesale meat supplier appears on a long building awning outside Samsung\u2019s U.S. flagship phone store.",
      "But the neighborhood no longer sounds, smells or feels like the place where Jobbagy began working for his father in the late 1960s. He worked through high school and college summers before going into business for himself.",
      "Back then, meatpackers kept bottles of whiskey in their lockers to stay warm inside the refrigerated plants. Outside, \u201cit reeked,\u201d he said, especially on hot days near the poultry houses where chicken juices spilled into the streets.",
      "People only visited the neighborhood if they had business, usually transacting in handshake deals, he said.",
      "Slowly but surely, meatpacking plants began closing or moving out of Manhattan as advances in refrigeration and packaging enabled the meat industry to consolidate around packing plants in the Midwest, many of which can butcher and package more than 5,000 steers in a day and ship directly to supermarkets.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, a new nightlife scene emerged as bars and nightclubs moved in, many catering to the LGBTQ+ community. Sex clubs and slaughterhouses coexisted. And as the decades wore on, the drag queens and club kids began giving way to fashion designers and restaurateurs.",
      "By 2000, \u201cSex and The City\u201d character Samantha had left her Upper East Side apartment for a new home in the Meatpacking District. By the show's final 2003 season, she was outraged to see a Pottery Barn slated to open near a local leather bar.",
      "Another turning point came with the 2009 opening of the High Line, on a defunct rail track originally built in the 1930s. The popular greenway is now flanked by hotels, galleries and luxury apartment buildings.",
      "Jobbagy said his father died five years before the opening and would be baffled at what it looks like now.",
      "\u201cIf I told him that the elevated railroad was going to be turned into a public park, he never would have believed it,\u201d he said.",
      "But the area has changed constantly, noted Andrew Berman, executive director of local architectural preservation group Village Preservation.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always a meatpacking district. It was a sort of wholesale produce district before that, and it was a shipping district before that,\" Berman said. In the early 1800s, Fort Gansevoort stood there. \"So it\u2019s had many lives and it\u2019s going to continue to have new lives.\u201d",
      "Though an exact eviction date for the last meat market has not been set, some of the other companies will relocate elsewhere.",

      "The Thanksgiving travel rush is expected to be bigger than ever this year",
      "DALLAS -- Just as there are good odds the turkey will taste dry, airports and highways are expected to be jam-packed during Thanksgiving week, a holiday period likely to end in another record day for air travel in the United States.",
      "The people responsible for keeping security lines, boarding areas and jetliners moving \u2014 from the U.S. transportation secretary and airline chiefs on down the line \u2014 swear they are prepared for the crowds.",
      "But a strike by service workers in Charlotte Douglas International Airport threatens a hub in the Carolinas.",
      "Airline passengers might get lucky like they did last year, when relatively few flights were canceled during the holiday week. A repeat will require the weather's cooperation. And even if skies are blue, a shortage of air traffic controllers could create delays.",
      "Auto club and insurance company AAA predicts that nearly 80 million Americans will venture at least 50 miles from home between Tuesday and next Monday. Most of them will travel by car.",
      "Drivers should get a slight break on gas prices. The nationwide average price for gasoline was $3.06 a gallon on Sunday, down from $3.27 at this time last year.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18.3 million people at U.S. airports during the same seven-day stretch. That would be 6% more than during the corresponding days last year but fit a pattern set throughout 2024.",
      "The TSA predicts that 3 million people will pass through airport security checkpoints on Sunday; more than that could break the record of 3.01 million set on the Sunday after the July Fourth holiday. Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to be the next-busiest air travel days of Thanksgiving week.",
      "\u201cThis will be the busiest Thanksgiving ever in terms of air travel,\u201d TSA Administrator David Pekoske said. \u201cFortunately, our staffing is also at the highest levels that they have ever been. We are ready.\u201d",
      "Pekoske said TSA will have enough screeners to keep general security lines under 30 minutes and lines for people who pay extra for PreCheck under 10 minutes.",
      "Service workers at Charlotte Douglas International Airport walked off the job to protest what they call unlivable wages.",
      "Charlotte Douglas International Airport officials have said this holiday travel season is expected to be the busiest on record, with an estimated 1.02 million passengers departing the airport between last Thursday and the Monday after Thanksgiving.",
      "Several hundred workers were expected to walk off the job and continue the work stoppage throughout Monday.",
      "However, an ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers could cause flight delays.",

      "Thanksgiving Day takes place late this year, with the fourth Thursday of November falling on Nov. 28. That shortens the traditional shopping season and changes the rhythm of holiday travel.",
      "With more time before the holiday, people tend to spread out their outbound travel over more days, but everyone returns at the same time, said Andrew Watterson, the chief operating officer of Southwest Airlines.",
      "\u201cA late Thanksgiving leads to a big crush at the end \u2014 the Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday after Thanksgiving are usually very busy with Thanksgiving this late,\" Watterson said.",
      "Airlines did a relatively good job of handling holiday crowds last year, when the weather was mild in most of the country. Fewer than 400 U.S. flights were canceled during Thanksgiving week in 2023 \u2014 about one of every 450 flights. So far in 2024, airlines have canceled about 1.3% of all flights.",
      "The rise of remote work also has caused the Thanksgiving travel period to expand, AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic changed everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have seen is that post-pandemic, people are leaving at certain times, perhaps even leaving the weekend before Thanksgiving, working remotely from their destination a couple of days, and then enjoying time with their loved ones.\u201d",
      "Nightmares of Thanksgivings past have further shaped holiday traffic jams. Motorists who learned to avoid traveling the day before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving have created new bottlenecks on other days, according to Diaz.",
      "\u201cBecause we warned for so long (that) Wednesday and Sunday are the worst days to travel, people were like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to leave on Tuesday and come back on Monday to avoid the rush,\u2019\" she said. \u201cSo now those two days are congested as well.\u201d",
      "Airport security officials are pleading with passengers to arrive early, not to put lithium-ion batteries in checked bags in case they overheat, and to keep guns out of carry-on bags. TSA has discovered more than 6,000 guns at checkpoints this year, and most of them were loaded.",
      "Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas bring out many infrequent travelers, and they often have questions about what they can bring on the plane.",
      "TSA has a list on its website of items that are banned or restricted.",
      "Drivers should know that Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons will be the worst times to travel by car, but it should be smooth sailing on freeways come Thanksgiving Day, according to transportation analytics company INRIX.",
      "On the return home, the best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday, and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday, the company said.",
      "In metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and Washington, \u201ctraffic is expected to be more than double what it typically is on a normal day,\u201d INRIX transportation analyst Bob Pishue said."

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Tens of thousands of Spaniards marched in downtown Barcelona on Saturday to protest the skyrocketing cost of renting an apartment in the popular tourist destination.",
      "Protesters cut off traffic on main avenues in the city center, holding up homemade signs in Spanish reading \u201cFewer apartments for investing and more homes for living\" and \u201cThe people without homes uphold their rights.\u201d",
      "The lack of affordable housing has become one of the leading concerns for the southern European Union country, mirroring the housing crunch across many parts of the world, including the United States.",
      "Organizers said that over 170,000 had turned out, while Barcelona\u2019s police said they estimated some 22,000 marched.",
      "Either way, the throngs of people clogging the streets recalled the massive separatist rallies at the height of the previous decade\u2019s Catalan independence movement. Now, social concerns led by housing have displaced political crusades.",
      "That is because the average rent for Spain has doubled in last 10 years. The price per square meter has risen from 7.2 euros ($7.5) in 2014 to 13 euros this year, according to the popular online real estate website Idealista. The growth is even more acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid. Incomes meanwhile have failed to keep up, especially for younger people in a country with chronically high unemployment.",
      "Protester Samuel Saintot said he is \u201cfrustrated and scared\u201d after being told by the owners of the apartment he has rented for the past 15 years in Barcelona\u2019s city center that he must vacate the premises. He suspects that the owners want him out so they can renovate it and boost the price.",
      "\u201cEven looking in a 20- or 30-kilometer radius outside town, I can\u2019t even find anything within the price range I can afford,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I consider myself a very fortunate person, because I earn a decent salary. And even in my case, I may be forced to leave town.\u201d",
      "A report by the Bank of Spain indicates that nearly 40% of Spaniards who rent dedicate an average of 40% of their income to paying rents and utilities, compared to the European Union average of 27% of renters who do so.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a housing emergency. It means people having many difficulties both in accessing and staying in their homes,\u201d said Ignasi Mart\u00ed, professor for Esade business school and head of its Dignified Housing Observatory.",
      "The rise in rents is causing significant pain in Spain, where traditionally people seek to own their homes.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term renters including tourists. Many migrants to Spain are also disproportionately hit by the high rents because they often do not have enough savings.",
      "Spain is near the bottom end of OECD countries with under 2% of all housing available being public housing for rent. The OECD average is 7%. Spain is far behind France, with 14%, Britain with 16%, and the Netherlands with 34%.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to make prices fall to what they were a few years back. It makes me cry,\u201d said protester Laia Pizju\u00e1n. \u201cIt's so upsetting. I know so many people who are in a bad situation. I have relatives living together in crowded apartments because they can\u2019t afford to live on their own.\u201d",
      "Carme Arcarazo, spokesperson for Barcelona\u2019s Tenants Union which helped organize the protest, said that renters should consider a \u201crent strike\u201d and cease paying their monthly rents in a mass protest movement.",
      "\u201cI think we the tenants have understood that this depends on us. That we can\u2019t keep asking and making demands to the authorities and waiting for an answer. We must take the reins of the situation,\u201d Arcarazo told the AP. \u201cSo, if they (the owners) won\u2019t lower the rent, then we will force them to do it.\"",
      "The Barcelona protest came a month after tens of thousands rallied against high rents in Madrid.",
      "The rising discontent over housing is putting pressure on Spain\u2019s governing Socialist party, which leads a coalition on the national level and is in charge of Catalonia\u2019s regional government and Barcelona\u2019s city hall.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez presided over what the government termed a \u201chousing summit\u201d including government officials and real estate developers last month. But the Barcelona\u2019s Tenants Union boycotted the event, saying it was like calling a summit for curing cancer and inviting tobacco companies to participate.",
      "The leading government measure has been a rent cap mechanism that the central government has offered to regional authorities based on a price index established by the housing ministry. Rent controls can be applied to areas deemed to be \u201chighly stressed\u201d by high rental prices. Catalonia was the first region to apply those caps, which are in place in downtown Barcelona.",
      "Many locals blame the million of tourists who visit Barcelona, and the rest of Spain, each year for the high prices. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate the city\u2019s 10,000 so called \u201ctourist apartments,\u201d or dwellings with permits for short-term rents, by 2028."

    "story": [
      "George Russell won the Formula 1 race Saturday night in the Las Vegas Grand Prix and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton was second",
      "LAS VEGAS -- An ecstatic George Russell had just won the Formula 1 race Saturday night when he exclaimed in his radio, \u201cVegas!\u201d",
      "He was ready to start celebrating in America's party capital, saying he would skip his flight back to his home in the United Kingdom to make the most of his Las Vegas Grand Prix victory.",
      "\u201cI'm definitely not getting on that flight,\u201d Russell said in the post-race podium interview with actor Terry Crews and the Bellagio fountains in the background. \u201cI'm going to enjoy this evening.\u201d",
      "This night, however, wasn't just about Russell. Lewis Hamilton finished second to give Mercedes the top two positions.",
      "Given the turmoil surrounding the team \u2014 Hamilton moves to Ferrari next year \u2014 and the disappointment of not contending for the constructors' championship, Mercedes at least had this night.",
      "Even if some of that spotlight was shared with Max Verstappen, who clinched his fourth consecutive title, doing just enough with a fifth-place finish.",
      "This is the first time since the 2022 race in Brazil that Mercedes went 1-2, that being the same order with Russell and then Hamilton.",
      "Team principal Toto Wolff said Mercedes could carry over this success to next weekend\u2019s race at Qatar because the weather and track are similar. He was less optimistic about the season finale at Abu Dhabi.",
      "But that\u2019s for another day. He was happy to celebrate what Mercedes accomplished on this night, but unlike Russell, Wolff was following through on his plan to return to Los Angeles on Sunday and be with his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to come back with a 1-2, and I\u2019m happy with the way we got there because we dominated the race,\" Wolff said. \"There are laps when we were two seconds faster and it feels good.\u201d",
      "Brazil in '22 was Russell's only victory until this season when he won in Austria in June. He's considered a three-time winner because his July victory in Belgium resulted in disqualification for failing the car's minimum-weight limit in the post-race inspection.",
      "Hamilton, instead, was given the victory. Otherwise, that also would've been a top-two finish for Mercedes.",
      "Of Hamilton's F1-record 105 victories, his first with Mercedes occurred nearly 10 years ago to the day.",
      "He had the car capable of racing to win No. 106, putting together the best practice times before stumbling in the third and final qualifying run Friday night. That landed him 10th on the starting line.",
      "\u201cI guess it would've been a breeze today (with a better starting position), but it's OK,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI had fun coming back from 10th. The team did a fantastic job. We don't know why we are so quick this weekend.\u201d",
      "Wolff said he was impressed how Hamilton fought his way through the field for such a strong finish. But next year, Hamilton will be on another team, and Wolff will be searching for ways to keep him off the podium.",
      "In the post-race news conference, Hamilton deflected any disappointment about what could've been and instead heaped praise on the winner.",
      "\u201cGeorge did a great job,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cHe did everything you're supposed to do. I'm happy for him, and I'm just grateful I could get back up there and support the team like I want to.\u201d",
      "Russell showed what he was capable of accomplishing in Las Vegas by securing the pole though he said starting first hasn't always been beneficial to him.",
      "It was this time.",
      "\u201cI think we won the race from step one,\u201d Russell said. \u201cIt was exceptional and I knew from there on in ... the only way we were going to lose the victory was if I (damaged) the tires. So it was just a case of managing my pace ... and bringing it home.\u201d",

      "And another eagle-birdie finish \u2014 for the second straight day \u2014 made it happen.",
      "Thitikul claimed the record-setting $4 million first-place check by winning the CME Group Tour Championship on Sunday. It's the biggest money prize in women\u2019s golf history, bigger than even the winner\u2019s shares in three of the four men\u2019s major championships this year.",
      "\u201cToday, standing here with the trophy, it's more than I can ask for,\u201d Thitikul said.",
      "Thitikul shot a 7-under 65 on Sunday and finished the week at 22 under, one shot ahead of Angel Yin (66). Yin had a two-shot lead walking to the 17th tee, only to wind up settling for the $1 million runner-up check.",
      "Yin \u2014 who missed the start of the season after breaking her leg over the winter \u2014 hardly sounded defeated after finishing second and more than doubling her 2024 earnings in four days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty awesome. ... I\u2019ve learned that I just need to believe my myself and that\u2019s what I did,\" Yin said.",
      "The win and the massive check came down to the 18th hole, Thitikul and Yin tied at 21 under after a back-and-forth day atop the leaderboard \u2014 both knowing a mistake would likely come at a $3 million cost.",
      "Both hit the fairway on 18. Thitikul\u2019s approach was nearly perfect, stopping about 5 feet from the cup. Yin\u2019s response stopped maybe 15 feet away, giving Thitikul the edge as they walked up the fairway. She was smiling broadly as she approached the green, almost as if she knew what was about to happen.",
      "Yin\u2019s birdie putt just missed. Thitikul\u2019s was dead center. And history was hers.",
      "Her plans for all that cash?",
      "\u201cDefinitely spend it,\u201d Thitikul said. \u201cThat\u2019s an honest answer, for sure. Definitely going to spend it for a little while.\u201d",
      "She already had clinched a $1 million bonus this week through the Aon Risk-Reward Challenge, a competition based on how players score on a designated hole each week. In the end, it wound up as a whopping $5 million week for the 21-year-old from Thailand \u2014 and going 8 under on the Nos. 17 and 18 over the four days at Tiburon Golf Club made the difference.",
      "\u201cAll the hard work paid off,\u201d said Thitikul, whose eagle-birdie close to Saturday's round pulled her into a tie for the lead with Yin going into Sunday at 15 under.",
      "It didn\u2019t take long on Sunday for Thitikul to jump in front, with birdies on two of the first three holes to grab a two-shot edge. Her lead vanished with a two-shot swing on the par-4 fourth; Yin made birdie, Thitikul bogey.",
      "It seemed like Yin grabbed control on the par-3 16th. Her birdie putt from across the green \u2014 about 25 feet \u2014 rolled in for a two-shot lead with two holes to play. But her second shot at the par-5 17th missed the green right, and the door was opened for Thitikul.",
      "The eagle-birdie finish Saturday gave her hope.",
      "The eagle-birdie finish Sunday gave her so much more \u2014 even though, it turns out, the second shot on the par 5 wasn't one that she caught flush. It worked out anyway.",
      "\u201cJust lucky enough,\u201d Thitikul said.",
      "Olympic gold medalist Lydia Ko (63) finished third at 17 under, her nine birdies coming in a 13-hole span.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to work hard this offseason and have another great 2025,\u201d Ko said.",
      "Ruoning Yin (68) was alone in fourth at 16 under, and LPGA player of the year Nelly Korda (66) finished at 15 under along with Narin An (68). Ayaka Furue finished at 13 under, good enough to give her the Vare Trophy as the LPGA\u2019s season-long scoring champion over Haeran Ryu.",
      "\u201cI feel very happy to have this trophy in my hands,\u201d said Furue, the first Japanese player to win the Vare.",
      "Lexi Thompson \u2014 a 15-time winner as a pro who plans to step away from full-time golf \u2014 finished at 2 under. It\u2019s not clear how often Thompson plans to play in 2025 and beyond; that said, she returns to Tiburon the week of Dec. 9 for the Grant Thornton Invitational, where she\u2019ll team with Rickie Fowler in the event featuring PGA Tour and LPGA Tour players.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, guys.\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in two weeks.\u201d",
      "There were two players who said they were retiring after Sunday\u2019s round: Marina Alex, who shot 66 to finish at 12 under, and Ally Ewing, who closed with a 68 to wrap up the week at 11 under.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to have ended on my best,\u201d said Alex, a bottle of sparkling wine in her right hand, a bouquet of flowers in the other.",
      "Added Ewing: \u201cI\u2019ve been at peace with my decision. It\u2019s just so nice to be able to share the walk with my family this week.\u201d",
      "But in the end, the week belonged to Thitikul. And as the sun was setting over Tiburon on Sunday, she was ready for her offseason to begin with a well-deserved celebration.",
      "\u201cAnybody hungry?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am.\u201d",

      "For the first time in 11 years, the 85-year-old patriarch of the Harbaugh family has to be a neutral observer with Jim\u2019s Los Angeles Chargers hosting John\u2019s Baltimore Ravens in the third matchup between the coaching brothers.",
      "Manning, more than anyone, knows the attention and conflicting emotions of these games. He had to go through it three times when his sons, quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, faced off. Peyton won all three meetings over Eli and the New York Giants, first with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 and \u201910, and then with the Denver Broncos in 2013.",
      "At least Manning and his wife, Olivia, had something to root for during those games \u2014 the offenses of both teams their sons were leading. Jack and Jackie Harbaugh can\u2019t get that since the head coaches are responsible for all the players.",
      "\"The first thing is you\u2019re proud because it is pretty unique. The second thing is, you don\u2019t like it,\" Archie Manning said during a phone call. \"You\u2019re proud that both are in the National Football League, but you just assume it wouldn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t fun. I guess we were lucky it happened only three times. Heck, they could have been in the same division and done it 20 times.\"",
      "Jack Harbaugh didn\u2019t do interviews this week. He said that, leading up to Super Bowl 47, he appreciated hearing from Manning before it happened the first time in 2011 when Jim\u2019s San Francisco 49ers visited John\u2019s Baltimore squad.",
      "The Ravens won that game 16-6. John received even more bragging rights the following season after the Ravens\u2019 34-31 victory in New Orleans on Feb. 3, 2013, on football\u2019s ultimate stage.",
      "Before the first \u201cHarbaugh Bowl,\u201d Archie Manning offered Jack Harbaugh some advice \u2014 \u201cIt will be over soon enough.\u201d",
      "Jack and Jackie Harbaugh attended the first two meetings, but will not be at Monday\u2019s game. Instead, they will be at their daughter Joanie\u2019s house in Bradenton, Florida, for Thanksgiving and to celebrate their 63rd wedding anniversary.",
      "Chargers defensive analyst Rick Minter went up against Jack Harbaugh before getting to coach with both sons. John Harbaugh was on Minter\u2019s staff at the University of Cincinnati and has been on Jim Harbaugh\u2019s staffs at Michigan and the Chargers when his son, Jesse, was hired as defensive coordinator.",
      "\u201cBoth sons are so tuned into their father with great respect. He\u2019s passed (the game) down in so many ways to them, but they still look to him for advice,\u201d Minter said. \u201cJack still does it where he watches game films (of the Ravens and Chargers) and writes up reports.",
      "\u201cJack is a crowd-pleasing speaker. He\u2019s excitable and emotional, and he brings it out and gets his message across. I don\u2019t know if Jack and John are either one. They are more modern, less authoritative and more connective, collaborative and well-spoken and all those types of things.\u201d",
      "The Harbaughs, though, aren\u2019t the only connections in this matchup. Five assistant coaches on Jim Harbaugh\u2019s staff \u2014 including offensive coordinator Greg Roman and Jesse Minter \u2014 also coached for John Harbaugh in Baltimore.",
      "Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz spent 26 seasons in the Ravens front office before coming to Los Angeles when Jim Harbaugh returned to the NFL earlier this year.",
      "Roman, who has been an assistant for Jim Harbaugh for seven years at Stanford, San Francisco, and the Chargers, along with five seasons with John Harbaugh in Baltimore, said the feeling going into Monday night has been the same as any other game on the schedule.",
      "Roman was asked again this past week to point out the differences between the two brothers, but he pointed out the similarities.",
      "\u201cI learned a lot from both of them. Every brother and sister, everybody\u2019s different, you know. So it\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition if you will,\u201d he said. \u201cBut very similar in a lot of ways and just a little different nuances with each. But they\u2019re very strong leaders.\u201d",
      "Six players, including running backs J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, are also former Ravens. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy was with the Chargers during the 2022 season, while backup quarterback Josh Johnson (San Diego) and outside linebacker David Ojabo (Michigan) played for Jim Harbaugh in college.",
      "The Chargers (7-3) have a four-game winning streak.",
      "The Ravens (7-4) entered the weekend trailing the Steelers by a game in the AFC North and also can\u2019t afford to fall behind in the wild-card race.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different but fun because it is two similar type ballclubs hashing it out,\u201d said Chargers safety and former Raven Tony Jefferson. \u201cIt is two physical teams on both sides of the ball and dynamic players at quarterback. It lines up to be a good matchup, and that\u2019s what you strive for in games, especially prime time.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 17:30:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The St. Louis Blues have fired coach Drew Bannister and hired Jim Montgomery as his replacement",
    "story": [
      "The St. Louis Blues have fired coach Drew Bannister and hired Jim Montgomery as his replacement",
      "Drew Bannister is out as coach of the St. Louis Blues after less than a full calendar year on the job. Jim Montgomery is back behind the bench of an NHL team five days after he was fired by the Boston Bruins.",
      "The Blues fired Bannister on Sunday and hired Montgomery as his replacement, a stunning move a quarter of the way through the NHL season that puts a seasoned coach in charge of shepherding St. Louis through a retooling period and into the potential re-opening of the organization's Stanley Cup-contending window.",
      "President and general manager Doug Armstrong said he did not anticipate making a change until Montgomery became a free agent.",
      "\u201cThis was more of an opportunity to get someone of Jim\u2019s caliber than anything else,\u201d Armstrong said on a video call with reporters. \u201cWhen I talked to Drew today I told him this was more of a decision based on the availability of someone I think is a top NHL coach, someone that we have experience with, someone I really do believe can coach this team and also coach the team when it reaches its ultimate level of competitiveness.\"",
      "Armstrong showed no hesitation in cutting ties with Bannister, who had the interim tag removed from his title and became the full-time coach in May. Bannister was promoted from Springfield of the American Hockey League to replace 2019 Cup-winning coach Craig Berube last December, and the Blues missed the playoffs despite winning 30 of their final 54 games.",
      "The Blues lost 13 of their first 22 games this season. Only two teams have scored fewer than their 2.36 goals a game, and they rank in the bottom third of the league on the power play and penalty kill while ravaged by injuries.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy situation for him to walk into,\u201d Armstrong said, adding he felt Bannister was learning on the fly as a first-time NHL head coach. \u201cHe was making mistakes. We were all making mistakes. ... I was more than willing to go through the peaks and valleys with Drew until Monty became available.\u201d",
      "Montgomery, 55, is tasked with getting the most out of the talent available, something he has accomplished elsewhere. Every team he has coached for a full season has qualified for the playoffs, and his .659 points percentage ranks among the best in NHL history.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got a wealth of experience, and he\u2019s at really the prime of his coaching career,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cHe\u2019s the full package, or at least we hope he\u2019s the full package.\u201d",
      "The Bruins opted to move on from Montgomery after their rough start, going 8-9-3, with the final defeat being a 5-1 home loss to Columbus. Boston won 120 of 184 regular-season games with Montgomery running the show, including setting the league records for victories and points in 2021-22 when he was the obvious choice for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year.",
      "His second act as a head coach in the NHL came after Montgomery's first ended abruptly. Hired by the Dallas Stars in 2018, he led them to the second round and then was fired in December 2019 for unprofessional conduct.",
      "Montgomery called his dismissal appropriate, entered rehab and began putting his life back together.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s obviously gone through things at the rink and away from the rink that defined who he is today,\u201d Armstrong said.",
      "Montgomery got his re-entry into hockey from the Blues, with Armstrong hiring Montgomery as an assistant on Berube's staff in September 2020. That was the first sign of the longtime executive's affinity for Montgomery, and the latest comes with job security. St. Louis signed him to a five-year contract.",
      "Montgomery is the latest coach to be fired and re-hired midseason, a more common occurrence in the NHL than most professional sports leagues. Being out of a job for mere days is reminiscent of Bruce Boudreau's experience in 2011, when he was fired by Washington on a Monday morning and replaced Randy Carlyle in Anaheim later that week.",
      "This is the 23rd coaching change among the league's 32 teams since January 2023, with the Blues among those making multiple moves in that time.",
      "\u201cA coach that I believe is a difference-maker became available, and we reacted to it,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWe have a top-level NHL coach, and now it\u2019s time for all of us to do our jobs and support him.\u201d",

      "Patrick Mahomes threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns, Spencer Shrader kicked a 31-yard field goal as time expired and the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Carolina Panthers 30-27 to reach double-digit wins for the 10th straight season",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Ten yards into a scramble, Patrick Mahomes could have easily slid for a first down or simply ducked out of bounds and moved on to the next play.",
      "Instead, the three-time Super Bowl MVP cut back inside and raced another 23 yards up the field, helping to set up Spencer Schrader's 31-yard field goal as time expired as the Chiefs held on to beat the Carolina Panthers 30-27 on Sunday.",
      "\u201cAt that point, yards are more important than getting out of bounds,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cWith three timeouts, I just tried to just cut through and Justin Watson had a great block and was able to get down the field and get out of bounds.\u201d",
      "The game-winning drive was the 21st of Mahomes' career, and the Chiefs won a game decided in the final seconds for the fifth time this season. Eight of the Chiefs' wins have come by one-score margins.",
      "\u201cYou always want to have some blowouts and be a little calmer in the fourth quarter, but I've always said it could be a good thing when you get to the playoffs later in the season knowing that you have been in those moments before, and knowing how to attack it play by play not making it too big of a moment,\u201d Mahomes said.",
      "Then he smiled and said: \u201cBut I would say this more than anybody, I would love to win a game not by the very last play.\u201d",
      "Mahomes completed 27 of 37 passes for 269 yards and three touchdowns in his first game at Bank of America Stadium and ran for 60 yards \u2014 including 33 on that last-minute play \u2014 as the Chiefs (10-1) scored on six of their eight possessions.",
      "Noah Gray caught four passes for 66 yards and scored two touchdowns for the second straight week, and DeAndre Hopkins also found the end zone for the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Kareem Hunt ran for 68 yards on 16 carries and caught three passes for 19 yards.",
      "Bryce Young played well for Carolina (3-8), finishing 21 of 35 for 262 yards and a touchdown while leading the Panthers back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter to tie the game on Chuba Hubbard's 1-yard touchdown run and 2-point conversion with 1:46 remaining.",
      "Panthers coach Dave Canales, who benched Young earlier this season for veteran Andy Dalton, said last year's No. 1 overall draft pick \u201cabsolutely\u201d will remain the team's starting QB next week. That's a break from Canales' recent pattern of waiting a few days to name a starter.",
      "\u201cBryce is certainly making the most of his opportunities,\u201d Canales said. \u201cAnd he is making a statement to all of us. Showing us he can make plays in critical areas. He did a great job extending today.\u201d",
      "Said Young: \u201cFor me, I just want to focus on what I can control. Regardless, I always have the same mindset and preparation, wanting to be better throughout the week. I am definitely grateful for confidence.\u201d",
      "Still, there is room for improvement.",
      "The Panthers moved the ball well but struggled in the red zone, resulting in field goals of 30, 32, 29 and 33 yards for Eddy Pineiro, the most accurate kicker in NFL history.",
      "The Chiefs wasted no time setting the tone as Samaje Perine returned the opening kickoff 56 yards and Mahomes found Gray for a 35-yard touchdown strike on the third play of scrimmage for a 7-0 lead. Gray went nine games without a TD catch before hauling in two last week against Buffalo. His 11-yard score late in the second quarter gave him two more against the Panthers.",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid praised Mahomes' poise but said he was concerned about his team's nine penalties for 90 yards.",
      "Kansas City's Travis Kelce had six catches for 62 yards and moved into third place in career yards receiving by a tight end. He ranks behind only Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten. However, Kelce failed to find the end zone for the ninth time in 11 games this season.",
      "Running back Jonathan Brooks made his NFL debut for Carolina, but the second-round pick was limited to 7 yards on two carries.",
      "Panthers: Rookie TE Ja'Tavion Sanders was taken to a hospital, where he was evaluated for a neck injury and released. He landed awkwardly on his head after making a catch near the end of the second quarter.",

      "Jaxon Smith-Njigba had six catches for 77 yards and the first offensive touchdown against the Cardinals (6-5) in three weeks. But it was the defense that made the difference for the Seahawks (6-5) against their division rivals, who had their four-game winning streak snapped.",
      "\u201cI thought he was dominant,\u201d Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said of Williams. \u201cI knew he played great and then I looked at the stat line and I realized he played out of his mind.\u201d",
      "Williams finished with six tackles and four quarterback hurries for Seattle, which has beaten Arizona six straight times. The teams play again in two weeks.",
      "The Cardinals averaged more than 29 points per game in their previous three, but the Seahawks held them to 298 total yards and 49 yards rushing while sacking Murray five times.",
      "Williams said the team has been coming together since a leadership meeting following their bye week two weeks ago. He said the Seahawks declared the remainder of the season a playoff run and he woke up Sunday feeling positive about the team.",
      "\u201cI think that made it just crunch time for us,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe just understood the urgency of getting the job done.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever run that fast,\u201d said Bryant, who finished the score with a dive into the end zone that resembled Marshawn Lynch's \u201cBeast Mode\u201d celebration. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to get fined, so hopefully Marshawn saw it.\u201d",
      "Murray drove the Cardinals to the Seattle 4 early in the fourth quarter, but Arizona settled for a 22-yard field goal by Chad Ryland.

      "It was the first touchdown allowed by the Cardinals' defense since the fourth quarter against Miami three weeks ago.",

      "\u201cCoach was in his bag this week,\u201d Witherspoon said.",
      "The Seahawks prepared this week while dealing with the effects of a storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of residents and team facilities. Some fans were still without power as more rain began to fall Sunday.",

      "All-Stars Paul George and Joel Embiid both missed Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Clippers with knee injuries",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- James Harden was about booed out of the arena each time he touched the ball, a sound of contempt not heard in Philly since \u2014 well, since Ben Simmons was razzed with much the same vocal voraciousness two nights earlier.",
      "The 76ers turned back the clock \u2014 \u201cway back,\u201d the public address announcer noted \u2014 wearing uniforms Sunday night designed to pay homage to their old home, the Spectrum.",
      "Their old players? Well, they hit Philly, too.",
      "Simmons, a former No. 1 pick once deemed a franchise cornerstone, returned Friday night with Brooklyn while Harden, now banging 3s with the Los Angeles Clippers, had his unceremonious homecoming Sunday night.",
      "Simmons and Harden each raised the promise of deep playoff runs \u2014 yes, even a championship \u2014 before their sensational starts with the Sixers disintegrated into toxic tenures full of ill will and, ultimately, a feeling of good riddance from all parties involved.",
      "Simmons and his shooting woes; Harden and his contract demands; no matter the symptoms for seasonal dysfunction through the years, the headache still pounds in Philadelphia.",
      "The malady these days: bad knees.",
      "Joel Embiid and Paul George, who signed $405 million worth of contracts in the offseason, remained pinned to the bench with knee injuries. George, a left knee bone bruise. Embiid, swelling in his left knee.",
      "Heck, even six-time All-Star Kyle Lowry (hip strain) sat out against the Clippers, left to watch the game wearing one of those goofy, oversized Philadelphia Eagles hats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not ideal and not that easy to manage,\u201d coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cBut it is part of the game. Guys come and go all the time. There\u2019s guys in and out, both sides of the ball. Again, I\u2019m always disappointed for the player.\u201d",
      "The public address announcer ran down the injury report \u2014 \u201cJoel Embiid, Paul George and Kyle Lowry are out\u201d \u2014 to a muted response from 76ers fans accustomed to sitting stars. If these walls could shrug.",
      "It\u2019s easy for Sixers fans \u2014 and the front office \u2014 to wonder what could have been the franchise\u2019s ceiling had Simmons or Harden stayed happy and healthy while they teamed with Embiid.",
      "George was just the latest star expected to help Embiid chase the 76ers\u2019 first championship since 1983. Yet, the early returns have been dismal. George has played in just eight of 16 games; Embiid only four.",
      "Without them, the 76ers fell to 3-13 following a 125-99 loss to the Clippers.",
      "Embiid, wearing an all-blue 76ers sweatshirt and sweatpants, shared a few quiet conversations with his teammates in the locker room.",
      "\u201cKept trying to keep his spirits high,\u201d All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey said. \u201cHe loves basketball. He wants to play basketball every single day. If he could play all 82 games, every single game of the playoffs, I promise you, he would.\u201d",
      "He doesn't, so Nurse, in his second season, does what he can and trotted out a starting lineup that included Kelly Oubre Jr. and Guerschon Yabusele in front of a crowd dotted with empty seats.",
      "The good news, Nurse said Embiid and George were both \u201cprogressing OK.\u201d George, the nine-time All-Star, got in some work on the court on Saturday. Nurse said Embiid\u2019s swelling was \u201clooking better\u201d ahead of more exams this week.",
      "Embiid\u2019s season was a disaster since training camp. The 30-year-old Embiid skipped the entire preseason, was suspended for scuffling with a columnist, called out by teammates in a closed-door team meeting and has fallen out of favor with fans that have tired of his will-he-or-won\u2019t-he-play melodrama.",
      "\u201cAs things go up and down, we\u2019re all trying to keep things level,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think he has kept things pretty level. He\u2019s been very communicative and seems to be OK. He understands that we\u2019re trying to figure this out as we go here. He also understands the team\u2019s not getting good results. So there is a lot to talk about.\u201d",
      "Clippers coach Tyronn Lue was an assistant coach on the U.S. team that won gold in Paris and declined to enter the fray over Embiid's health at the Olympics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was supposed to be healthy or not,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe helped us win a gold medal, it\u2019s all I know.\u201d",
      "At least the Sixers announced Friday night that Embiid would miss the Clippers\u2019 game, allowing fans to try and dump a pair of tickets on the secondary market for the price of a couple of coffeehouse chain drinks.",
      "Of note, rookie Jared McCain has about been worth the price of admission on those discount ducats.",
      "The Clippers, coming off a 4-0 homestand, played without Kawhi Leonard and other teams missing their All-Stars for reasons both fishy and fair are the norm around the league.",
      "The 76ers have no choice \u2014 much as they have since Embiid was drafted in 2014 \u2014 but to find a way around the absences.",
      "\u201cAlmost all the time,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cwe need to try something.\u201d",

      "The Broncos (7-5) took another step toward an unexpected playoff spot with their second victory in a row.",
      "\u201cA year ago, we don't win that game,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cIt wasn't our best, but it was good enough. We're on to the next one, so we have a lot to clean up, but it was good to handle these guys for a second time.\u201d",

      "\u201cI never doubt the mindset of everybody in that locker room,\u201d Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby said. \u201cEverybody shows up every day with the mindset to get better, so that's all you can ask for.\u201d",
      "Nix finished 25 of 42, and his 18-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton in the third quarter broke the club rookie record of 14 TD passes set by Marlin Briscoe in 1968. Nix and Sutton later hooked up for a 2-yard TD with 5:30 left to give the Broncos a two-possession lead.",
      "Those plays helped erase a 13-9 halftime deficit. The Broncos outscored Las Vegas 20-6 in the second half after adjusting to the Raiders' willingness to repeatedly bring more pressure than anticipated.",
      "\u201cWe had to shift that mindset,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe went into the game expecting (some). We had some calls for it, so now we had to get to those and adjust to them. I thought we did a good job handling the pressure, getting some more 1-on-1s.\u201d",
      "Denver lost its previous four games at Allegiant Stadium. This also was the Broncos' first road win in this series since defeating the then-Oakland Raiders on Oct. 11, 2015.",
      "\u201cI think the tide is turning,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThe Broncos are in a spot where we want to be back in the AFC West, and I think that's a really exciting spot to be in. Job's not finished.\u201d",
      "Sutton caught eight passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns to extend his streak of 70-yard games to five. That's the longest streak by a Broncos player since Demaryius Thomas' eight straight in 2014.",
      "Raiders quarterback Gardner Minshew landed hard on his left shoulder late in the game and was replaced by Desmond Ridder. Minshew will miss the rest of the season with a broken collarbone, according to multiple reports.",
      "Minshew completed 25 of 42 passes for 230 yards, with a touchdown and interception. The best passing play, however, came on a fake punt when AJ Cole completed a 34-yard pass to linebacker Divine Deablo to set up a second-quarter field goal.",
      "That was one of four field goals by Daniel Carlson, whose duel with Broncos counterpart Will Lutz kept Las Vegas in the game. They combined to make all nine of their attempts, including three from more than 50 yards.",
      "Jakobi Meyers caught 10 passes for 121 yards. That\u2019s his best game since 2020, when Meyers played for the New England Patriots and caught 12 passes for 169 yards against the New York Jets.",
      "Crosby recorded his 100th tackle for loss in the second quarter, becoming the fourth player to reach that number since at least 1999 in his first six seasons. The others were J.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and DeMarcus Ware.",

      "That's certainly what it took this time.",
      "With the teams both getting one play to score from the 3, Texas A&M turned to trickery on its attempt to send it to a fifth OT. Receiver Terry Bussey took the direct snap and handed off to quarterback Marcel Reed. Reed's pass to Amari Daniels was dropped in the end zone.",
      "The Aggies (8-3, 5-2), who had rallied from a 21-0 first-half deficit, suffered the fate of two other SEC playoff hopefuls. Florida had already upended No. 9 Mississippi\u2019s playoff and SEC title hopes with a 24-17 upset, and No. 7 Alabama fell 24-3 at Oklahoma.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Devin Neal ran for 207 yards and three touchdowns, caught four passes for 80 yards and another score, and led Kansas to a 37-21 victory over No. 16 Colorado on Saturday that dealt a big blow to the Buffaloes' hopes of playing for the Big 12 title.",
      "Jalon Daniels threw for 189 yards and a touchdown, and the Jayhawks (5-6, 4-4) scored on every offensive possession but their last, keeping Colorado stars Shedeur Sanders and Heisman Trophy candidate Travis Hunter standing on the sideline.",
      "\u201cWe controlled our own destiny,\u201d Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders said afterward, \u201cand we fumbled it.\u201d",
      "Now, the Buffaloes (8-3, 6-2 Big 12, No. 16 CFP) need to beat Oklahoma State next week and get some help to play for a title in their return to the Big 12, and ultimately earn the league\u2019s guaranteed spot in the College Football Playoff.",
      "Shedeur Sanders finished with 266 yards passing and three TDs, setting the Colorado single-season record with 30 of them, and Hunter had eight catches for 125 yards and two scores as the two-way standout continued his Heisman campaign.",
      "Problem is Hunter did little on defense, nor did anyone else in an all-white uniform. Kansas controlled the ball for more than 40 minutes, piled up 331 yards rushing and finished with 520 yards of total offense.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of negativity hanging around about what was wrong with this program and what should be done, and all of that,\u201d said Kansas coach Lance Leipold, whose team became the first in FBS history with a losing record to beat three straight teams in the AP Top 25. \u201cThey owned it, they kept working, they stuck together and you can see the results of that.\u201d",
      "The Jayhawks, whose back-to-back wins over Iowa State and BYU had given them newfound confidence, suddenly resemble the team expected to challenge for a Big 12 title, before a series of late-game collapses resulted in a 1-5 start.",
      "\u201cWe've just played with an extra edge, just in general these last three weeks. We have a different motivation,\u201d said Neal, who also became the first player in Kansas history with three 1,000-yard rushing seasons. \u201cEventually we were just tired of losing \u2014 tired of losing the close ones. We knew what we had to do. It was a matter of doing it.\u201d",
      "The Jayhawks sure did it Saturday, opening the scoring with Neal's 51-yard touchdown catch. They forced a three-and-out and scored again for a 10-0 lead. And when they got the ball back yet again, taking advantage of a misfiring Colorado offense, Kansas churned down field and Neal scampered into the end zone for another score.",
      "It was 17-0 before Hunter, who has emerged as the Heisman front-runner, took a short pass from Sanders and cut up field, deftly slipping between several Kansas defenders and going untouched 51 yards for a touchdown.",
      "The teams traded scores into the break, the Jayhawks holding tight to a 23-14 advantage. The question became whether Leipold and the Jayhawks would rue kicking field goals of 24, 23 and 25 yards rather than going for those first-half touchdowns.",
      "Nope.",
      "After the Buffaloes closed within 23-21 on Hunter's second TD catch, the Jayhawks marched 80 yards with Neal answering the score. Kansas immediately forced a three-and-out, sacking Sanders on third down \u2014 he appeared to shove an official in the back after the play \u2014 and the Neal scored again to cap an 8-plus minute drive and give the Jayhawks a 37-21 lead.",
      "Colorado's comeback chances ended when Cobee Bryant broke up a pass in the end zone on fourth down late in the game.",
      "\u201cIt was fun in the locker room, man,\u201d Bryant said, \"just to see the whole team smiling, having fun, jumping around.\u201d",
      "Colorado will lament a defense that was simply incapable of stopping the Jayhawks. Defensive back Shilo Sanders was flagged twice and gave up several big plays, while the Buffaloes were bullied up front by the Kansas offensive line.",
      "Kansas could improbably make a bowl game for a third straight season for the first time in school history. The Jayhawks merely need to beat Baylor in their regular-season finale to earn an invitation.",
      "Colorado plays Oklahoma State on Friday.",

      "INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- When Saquon Barkley glanced up at a SoFi Stadium replay of his latest huge run for the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night, he happened to see a graphic indicating he had 173 yards rushing \u2014 only 16 shy of what he knew to be his career high.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Aw, I wish I never saw that,'\" Barkley said with a grin. \u201cThat's just the devil talking, that's how I look at it. ... I'm a big believer that if it happens, it happens. Just let it come to you.\u201d",
      "Barkley decided to continue to run for his teammates, not for records. A few carries later, both his personal best and several additional superlatives fell right to him with his second massive touchdown run on a historic night.",
      "Barkley ran for scores of 70 and 72 yards in the second half and finished with an Eagles-record 255 yards rushing in Philadelphia\u2019s seventh consecutive victory, 37-20 over the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "Barkley racked up the ninth-most yards rushing in a game in NFL history largely thanks to his huge TD runs bookending the second half. He sprinted for a 70-yard score on the opening snap of the third quarter, and he added another huge run up the middle with 2:44 to play.",
      "\u201cSaquon has that ability to hit home runs, and so sometimes that\u2019s how it goes,\u201d Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"You get some short gain, short gain, short gain \u2014 boom, home run. Saquon is that type of player, and our offensive line did a good job of handling the variations of the front.\u201d",
      "Barkley had 302 total yards \u2014 becoming the 12th player in NFL history to top 300, and the first Eagles player \u2014 while also becoming the first NFL player with two 70-yard TD runs in a game since Maurice Jones-Drew in 2009.",
      "Barkley leads the league with a career-best 1,392 yards rushing, including a league-best seven 100-yard rushing games in his seismic first season with Philadelphia after six frustrating years with the Giants.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Barkley, a two-time Pro Bowl selection. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I would have this much success, (but) I\u2019m thankful to be here. I\u2019m thankful for the fresh start. A big reason why I wanted to come here (is) I felt like this is a spot where I could rewrite my story and show everyone the type of player that I feel like I can be and was meant to be, and it\u2019s working out right now.\u201d",
      "While averaging 9.8 yards per carry, Barkley obliterated the Eagles franchise records of 217 yards rushing by LeSean McCoy in 2013 and 296 total yards by Duce Staley in 2000. He also had the biggest rushing performance ever against the Rams, exceeding DeMarco Murray's 253 yards for Dallas in 2011.",
      "A.J. Brown caught six passes for 109 yards and a TD from Jalen Hurts, who threw for 179 yards while NFC East-leading Philadelphia (9-2) surged in a 24-point second half.",
      "Kyren Williams rushed for a score and Demarcus Robinson caught a TD pass for the Rams (5-6), who lost their second straight home game.",
      "Matthew Stafford passed for 243 yards while getting sacked five times by Philadelphia's top-ranked defense, and Los Angeles couldn't keep up with a Super Bowl contender in the second half of only its second loss in six games. Puka Nacua had nine catches for 117 yards, and Cooper Kupp caught a 27-yard touchdown pass with 1:07 to play.",
      "The Los Angeles defense gave up 480 yards, undoing several weeks of progress for a unit that also looked overmatched early in the season.",
      "\u201c(Barkley) is getting tough, hard-earned yards, and then you give him a vertical seam like he got a couple of times,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe has the explosiveness and long speed and the ability to finish. That is what opened and blew the game up for him. He was outstanding.\u201d",
      "The Eagles improved to 4-0 against the Rams in the Los Angeles area since the franchise returned home, but they led just 13-7 at halftime despite dominating both sides of the ball in the second quarter.",
      "Barkley had a mere 73 yards rushing in the first half for Philadelphia, but he broke open the game and the Rams\u2019 defense with his deft run up the middle to start the third quarter.",
      "\u201cHe makes a cut that I didn\u2019t think anybody else could make,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cLike, he just stopped on a dime.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles answered with Robinson's short TD catch, but Kenneth Gainwell rushed for a 13-yard TD moments later, one play after Barkley's 31-yard catch-and-run on third and long.",

      "The Justice Department and Google are set to make closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google are scheduled to make closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",

      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls only 25% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",
      "Google alleges in court papers that the government\u2019s lawsuit \u201cboil(s) down to the persistent complaints of a handful of Google\u2019s rivals and several mammoth publishers.\u201d",

      "Sunita Bose, managing director of Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, was answering questions at a single-day Senate committee hearing into world-first legislation that was introduced into the Parliament last week.",

      "Unaligned Sen. Jacqui Lambie asked why the platforms didn\u2019t use their algorithms to prevent harmful material being directed to children. The algorithms have been accused of keeping technology-addicted children connected to platforms and of flooding users with harmful material that promotes suicide and eating disorders.",
      "\u201cYour platforms have the ability to do that. The only thing that\u2019s stopping them is themselves and their greed,\u201d Lambie said.",
      "Bose said algorithms were already in place to protect young people online through functions including filtering out nudity.",

      "Questioned by opposition Sen. Dave Sharma, Bose said she didn\u2019t know how much advertising revenue the platforms she represented made from Australian children.",
      "She said she was not familiar with research by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health that found X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat made $11 billion in advertising from U.S. users under 18 in 2022.",
      "Communications department official Sarah Vandenbroek told the committee the evaluation of age assurance technologies that will report in June would assess not only their accuracy but also their security and privacy settings.",

      "\u201cI have the best health professionals helping me to make a recovery. I will be back as soon as I can. Please be patient and pray for my family and I,\u201d the post said.",

      "News of his ill health comes during a protracted battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire to the United States from New Zealand to face charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering.",
      "In August, New Zealand \u2019s justice minister announced that Dotcom should be surrendered to the United States to face trial, a ruling intended to cap a 12-year legal battle. A date for the extradition was not set, and Paul Goldsmith, the minister, said Dotcom would be allowed \u201ca short period of time to consider and take advice\u201d on the decision.",
      "Rothken at the time wrote on X that Dotcom intended to challenge the order in court through a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official\u2019s decision was reached correctly.",
      "The saga stretches to the 2012 arrest of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers. Prosecutors said the once wildly popular Megaupload raked in at least $175 million \u2014 mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies \u2014 before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested had argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors argued the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "The men fought the order for years \u2014 lambasting the investigation and arrests \u2014 but in 2021 New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be extradited. It remained up to the country\u2019s Justice Minister to decide if the extradition should proceed.",
      "\u201cI love New Zealand. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d German-born Dotcom wrote on X in August. He did not respond to an AP request for comment at the time, or on Monday.",
      "Two of Dotcom\u2019s former business partners pleaded guilty to the charges they faced and served time in a New Zealand jail, avoiding extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors abandoned an extradition bid against another, who has since died of cancer.",
      "Dotcom did not say in Monday\u2019s statement when he suffered the stroke. Usually a prolific X user, the internet mogul last posted to the site on Nov. 6."

      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said Sunday that the government was unable to drum up the support needed to pass the legislation. The opposition spokesman, David Coleman, said the bill \u201cbetrayed our democracy\u201d and amounted to \u201ccensorship laws in Australia.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Michigan State University engineering professor and undergraduate student have designed and produced a 3D-printed helmet earhole insert that helps to drown out crowd noise for some players on the school's football team",
      "EAST LANSING, Mich. -- The sight was a common one for Andrew Kolpacki. For many a Sunday, he would watch NFL games on TV and see quarterbacks putting their hands on their helmets, desperately trying to hear the play call from the sideline or booth as tens of thousands of fans screamed at the tops of their lungs.",
      "When the NCAA\u2019s playing rules oversight committee this past spring approved the use of coach-to-player helmet communications in games for the 2024 season, Kolpacki, Michigan State\u2019s head football equipment manager, knew the Spartans\u2019 QBs and linebackers were going to have a problem.",
      "\u201cThere had to be some sort of solution,\u201d he said.",
      "As it turns out, there was. And it was right across the street.",
      "Kolpacki reached out to Tamara Reid Bush, a mechanical engineering professor who not only heads the school\u2019s Biomechanical Design Research Laboratory but also is a football season ticket-holder.",
      "Kolpacki \u201cshowed me some photos and said that other teams had just put duct tape inside the (earhole), and he asked me, \u2018Do you think we can do anything better than duct tape,?\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh, absolutely.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bush and Rylie DuBois, a sophomore biosystems engineering major and undergraduate research assistant at the lab, set out to produce earhole inserts made from polylactic acid, a bio-based plastic, using a 3D printer. Part of the challenge was accounting for the earhole sizes and shapes that vary depending on helmet style.",
      "Once the season got underway with a Friday night home game against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30, the helmets of starting quarterback Aidan Chiles and linebacker Jordan Turner were outfitted with the inserts, which helped mitigate crowd noise.",
      "DuBois attended the game, sitting in the student section.",
      "\u201cI felt such a strong sense of accomplishment and pride,\u201d DuBois said. \u201cAnd I told all my friends around me about how I designed what they were wearing on the field.\u201d",
      "All told, Bush and DuBois have produced around 180 sets of the inserts, a number that grew in part due to the variety of helmet designs and colors that are available to be worn by Spartan players any given Saturday. Plus, the engineering folks have been fine-tuning their design throughout the season.",
      "Dozens of Bowl Subdivision programs are doing something similar. In many cases, they\u2019re getting 3D-printed earhole covers from XO Armor Technologies, which provides on-site, on-demand 3D printing of athletic wearables.",
      "The Auburn, Alabama-based company has donated its version of the earhole covers to the equipment managers of programs ranging from Georgia and Clemson to Boise State and Arizona State in the hope the schools would consider doing business with XO Armor in the future, said Jeff Klosterman, vice president of business development.",
      "XO Armor first was approached by the Houston Texans at the end of last season about creating something to assist quarterback C.J. Stroud in better hearing play calls delivered to his helmet during road games. XO Armor worked on a solution and had completed one when it received another inquiry: Ohio State, which had heard Michigan State was moving forward with helmet inserts, wondered if XO Armor had anything in the works.",
      "\u201cWe kind of just did this as a one-off favor to the Texans and honestly didn\u2019t forecast it becoming our viral moment in college football,\u201d Klosterman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got about 60 teams across college football and the NFL wearing our sound-deadening earhole covers every weekend.\u201d",
      "The rules state that only one player for each team is permitted to be in communication with coaches while on the field. For the Spartans, it\u2019s typically Chiles on offense and Turner on defense. Turner prefers to have an insert in both earholes, but Chiles has asked that the insert be used in only one on his helmet.",
      "Chiles \u201clikes to be able to feel like he has some sort of outward exposure,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "Exposure is something the sophomore signal-caller from Long Beach, California, had in away games against Michigan and Oregon this season. Michigan Stadium welcomed 110,000-plus fans for the Oct. 26 matchup between the in-state rivals. And while just under 60,000 packed Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, for the Ducks' 31-10 win over Michigan State three weeks earlier, it was plenty loud. \u201cThe Big Ten has some pretty impressive venues,\u201d Kolpacki said.",
      "\u201cIt can be just deafening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what those fans are there for is to create havoc and make it difficult for coaches to get a play call off.\u201d",
      "Something that is a bit easier to handle thanks to Bush and her team. She called the inserts a \u201cwin-win-win\" for everyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to work with athletics and the football team,\" she said. \"I think it\u2019s really exciting for our students as well to take what they\u2019ve learned and develop and design something and see it being used and executed.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in Texas is set to hold a hearing on whether the satirical news outlet The Onion made a valid bid for the Infowars platforms of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones",
      "A bankruptcy judge is set to hear arguments Monday in conspiracy theorist Alex Jones \u2019 effort to stop the satirical news outlet The Onion from buying Infowars and turning it into a parody.",
      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with him.",
      "It's not clear how soon U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will issue a ruling. He could allow The Onion to move forward with the sale, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Regardless, Jones has set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts that would allow him keep airing his show. And his personal account with 3.3 million followers on the social platform X was not part of the sale, although Lopez will be deciding whether it should be included in the liquidation and sold off later.",
      "Jones' bankruptcy and the liquidation of his assets came about after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones was found liable for defamation and emotional distress damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas for repeatedly calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Jones alleged The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of those families, the humor site and a court-appointed trustee who is overseeing the liquidation.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected among the sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account.",
      "In a court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "But at a Nov. 14 hearing Lopez said he was concerned about the process and transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Jones has brought in millions of dollars a year in revenue by hawking nutritional supplements, clothing, survival gear and other merchandise \u2014 including more than $22 million this year through Sept. 30 from his Infowars Store website, according to court documents.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court earlier this year said Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Attorneys for Fox Corp. are asking a Delaware judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Fox Corp. asked a Delaware judge Friday to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit seeking to hold current and former company officials personally liable for the financial fallout stemming from Fox News reports regarding alleged vote rigging in the 2020 election.",
      "Five New York City public employee pension funds, along with Oregon\u2019s public employee retirement fund, allege that former chairman Rupert Murdoch and other Fox Corp. leaders deliberately turned a blind eye to liability risks posed by reporting false claims of vote rigging by election technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic USA.",
      "Smartmatic is suing Fox News  for defamation in New York, alleging damages of $2.7 billion. It recently settled a lawsuit in the District of Columbia against One America News Network, another conservative outlet, over reports of vote fraud.",
      "Dominion also filed several defamation lawsuits against those who spread conspiracy theories blaming its election equipment for Donald Trump\u2019s loss in 2020. Last year, Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion in Delaware for $787 million.",
      "The shareholder plaintiffs also allege that Fox corporate leaders ignored \u201cred flags\u201d about liability arising from a 2017 report suggesting that Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer, may have been killed because he had leaked Democratic party emails to Wikileaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich, 27, was shot in 2016 in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have said was an attempted robbery.",
      "Fox News retracted the Seth Rich story a week after its initial broadcast, but Rich\u2019s parents sued the network for falsely portraying their son as a criminal and traitor. Fox News settled the lawsuit in 2020 for \u201cmillions of dollars,\u201d shortly before program hosts Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity were to be deposed, according to the shareholder lawsuit.",
      "Joel Friedlander, an attorney for the institutional shareholders, argued that Fox officials waited until the company\u2019s reporting about Rich became a national scandal before addressing the issue. Similarly, according to the shareholders, corporate officials, including Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, allowed Fox News to continue broadcasting false narratives about the 2020 election, despite internal communications suggesting that they knew there was no evidence to support the conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cThe Murdochs could have minimized future monetary exposure, but they chose not to,\u201d Friedlander said. Instead, he argued, they engaged in \u201cbad-faith decision making\u201d with other defendants in a profit-driven effort to retain viewers and remain in Trump\u2019s good graces.",
      "\u201cDecisions were made at the highest level to promote pro-Trump conspiracy theories without editorial control,\u201d Friedlander said.",
      "Defense attorneys argue that the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs filed their lawsuit without first demanding that the Fox Corp. board take action, as required under Delaware law. They say the plaintiffs also failed to demonstrate that a pre-suit demand on the Fox board would have been futile because at least half of the directors face a substantial likelihood of liability or are not independent of someone who does.",
      "Beyond the \u201cdemand futility\u201d issue, defense attorneys also argue that allegations that Fox officials breached their fiduciary duties fail to meet the pleading standards under Delaware and therefore should be dismissed.",
      "Defense attorney William Savitt argued, for example, that neither the Rich settlement, which he described as \u201cimmaterial,\u201d nor the allegedly defamatory statements about Dominion and Smartmatic constitute red flags putting directors on notice about the risk of defamation liability. Nor do they demonstrate that directors acted in bad faith or that Fox \u201cutterly failed\u201d to implement and monitor a system to report and mitigate legal risks, including defamation liability risk, according to the defendants.",
      "Savitt noted that the Rich article was promptly retracted, and that the settlement included no admission of liability. The Dominion and Smartmatic statements, meanwhile, gave rise themselves to the currently liability issues and therefore can not serve as red flags about future liability risks, according to the defendants.",
      "\u201cA \u2018red flag\u2019 must be what the term commonly implies \u2014 warning of a risk of a liability-causing event that allows the directors to take action to avert the event, not notice that a liability-causing event has already occurred,\u201d defense attorneys wrote in their motion to dismiss.",
      "Defense attorneys also say there are no factual allegations to support claims that Fox officials condoned illegal conduct in pursuit of corporate profits, or that they deliberately ignored their oversight responsibilities. They note that a \u201cbad outcome\u201d is not sufficient to demonstrate \u201cbad faith.\u201d",

      "Using drones and Google Earth imagery, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old network of earthen canals in what\u2019s now Belize",
      "WASHINGTON -- Long before the ancient Maya built temples, their predecessors were already altering the landscape of Central America\u2019s Yucatan peninsula.",
      "Using drones and Google Earth imagery, archaeologists have discovered a 4,000-year-old network of earthen canals in what\u2019s now Belize. The findings were published Friday in Science Advances.",
      "\u201cThe aerial imagery was crucial to identify this really distinctive pattern of zigzag linear canals\u201d running for several miles through wetlands, said study co-author Eleanor Harrison-Buck of the University of New Hampshire.",
      "The team then conducted digs in Belize's Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary. The ancient fish canals, paired with holding ponds, were used to channel and catch freshwater species such as catfish.",
      "\u201cBarbed spearpoints\u201d found nearby may have been tied to sticks and used to spear fish, said study co-author Marieka Brouwer Burg of the University of Vermont.",
      "The canal networks were built as early as 4,000 years ago by semi-nomadic people in the Yucatan coastal plain. According to the study, the canals were used for around 1,000 years or longer, including during the \u201cformative\u201d period when the Maya began to settle in permanent farming villages and a distinctive culture started to emerge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see such large-scale modifications of the landscape so early \u2014 it shows people were already building things,\u201d said University of Pittsburgh archaeologist Claire Ebert, who was not involved in the study.",
      "At the height of Maya civilization, people in this region built temples, roads, pyramids and other monuments. They also developed complex systems of writing, mathematics and astronomy. Scientists know far more about this era because there are many more significant archaeological sites, said Ebert.",
      "But this new study reveals a link between the earlier people on the landscape and the later emergence of Maya culture. These ancient channels for catching fish may have played a role in helping later Maya pyramids rise above the Yucatan rainforest.",
      "\u201cThis shows continuity,\" said University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Jeremy Sabloff, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "On a practical level, the fish-trapping canals helped the early people in the region to diversify their diets and feed a growing population, building a foundation for later cultural heights.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said.

      "The Competition and Markets Authority took aim at Apple, saying the iPhone maker's tactics hold back innovation by stopping rivals from giving users new features like faster webpage loading.

      "The counterprogramming of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in July 2023 hit a nerve culturally and had the receipts to back it up. Unlike so many things that begin as memes, it transcended its online beginnings. Instead of an either-or, the two movies ultimately complemented and boosted one another at the box office.",
      "And ever since, moviegoers, marketers and meme makers have been trying to recreate that moment, searching the movie release schedule for odd mashups and sending candidates off into the social media void. Most attempts have fizzled (sorry, \u201cSaw Patrol\u201d ).",
      "This weekend is perhaps the closest approximation yet as the Broadway musical adaptation \u201cWicked\u201d opens Friday against the chest-thumping sword-and-sandals epic \u201cGladiator II.\u201d Two big studio releases (Universal and Paramount), with one-name titles, opposite tones and aesthetics and big blockbuster energy \u2014 it was already halfway there before the name game began: \u201cWickiator,\u201d \u201cWadiator,\u201d \u201cGladwick\u201d and even the eyebrow raising \u201cGladicked\u201d have all been suggested.",
      "\u201c'Glicked' rolls off the tongue a little bit more,\u201d actor Fred Hechinger said at the New York screening of \u201cGladiator II\u201d this week. \u201cI think we should all band around \u2018Glicked.\u2019 It gets too confusing if you have four or five different names for it.\u201d",
      "As with \u201cBarbenheimer,\" as reductive as it might seem, \u201cGlicked\u201d also has the male/female divide that make the fan art extra silly. One is pink and bright and awash in sparkles, tulle, Broadway bangers and brand tie-ins; The other is all sweat and sand, blood and bulging muscles.",
      "Both films topped Fandango\u2019s most anticipated holiday movie survey, where 65% of respondents said that they were interested in the \u201cGlicked\u201d double feature. Theaters big and small are also pulling out the stops with movie-themed tie-ins. B&B Theaters will have Roman guards tearing tickets at some locations and Maximus popcorn tubs. Marcus Theaters is doing Oz photo ops and friendship bracelet-making. Alamo Drafthouse is leaning into the singalong aspect (beware, though, not all theaters are embracing this) and the punny drinks like \u201cDefying Gravi-Tea.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than it being in competition, I think they\u2019re in conversation,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d star Paul Mescal said. \u201cThis industry needs a shot in the arm. Those films gave it last year. We hope to do it this year.\u201d",
      "And the hope is that audiences will flock to theaters to be part of this moment as well. It's a sorely needed influx of could-be blockbusters into a marketplace that's still at an 11% deficit from last year and down 27.2% from 2019, according to data from Comscore.",
      "\u201cCompetition is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for consumers,\u201d said Michael O'Leary, the president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \u201cHaving two great movies coming out at the same time is simply a multiplier effect.\u201d",
      "\u201cGlicked\u201d is currently tracking for a combined North American debut in the $165 million range, with \u201cWicked\u201d forecast to earn around $100 million (up from the $80 million estimates a few weeks ago) and \u201cGladiator II\u201d pegged for the $65 million range.",
      "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d shattered its projections last July. Going into that weekend, \u201cBarbie\u201d had been pegged for $90 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d around $40 million. Ultimately, they brought in a combined $244 million in that first outing, and nearly $2.4 billion by the end of their runs.",
      "It\u2019s possible \u201cGlicked\u201d will exceed expectations, too. And it has the advantage of another behemoth coming close behind: \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which opens just five days later on the Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cGlickedana\u201d triple feature anyone?",
      "\u201cThese are 10 important days,\u201d O'Leary said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show the moviegoing audience that there\u2019s a lot of compelling stuff out there for them to see.\u201d",
      "There are infinite caveats to the imperfect comparison to \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as well. \u201cWicked\u201d is a \u201cPart One.\u201d Musicals carry their own baggage with moviegoers, even those based on wildly successful productions (ahem, \u201cCats\u201d). \u201cGladiator II\u201d got a head start and opened internationally last weekend. In fact, in the U.K. it played alongside \u201cPaddington in Peru,\u201d where that double was pegged \u201cGladdington.\u201d \u201cGladiator\u201d reviews, while positive, are a little more divided than the others. And neither directors Ridley Scott nor Jon M. Chu has the built-in box office cache that Christopher Nolan\u2019s name alone carries at the moment.",
      "The new films also cost more than \u201cBarbie\u201d ($145 million) and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d ($100 million). According to reports, \u201cGladiator II\u201d had a $250 million price tag; \u201cWicked\u201d reportedly cost $150 million to produce (and that does not include the cost of the second film, due next year).",

    "summary": "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "SpaceX on Tuesday launched another Starship rocket, but passed up catching the booster with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Unlike last month\u2019s success, the booster was directed to a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The catch was called off just four minutes into the test flight from Texas for safety reasons, and the booster hit the water three minutes later.",
      "SpaceX's Elon Musk said Wednesday via X that the booster catch was aborted due to lost communication with a launch tower computer.",
      "At the same time, the empty spacecraft launched from Texas atop Starship soared across the Gulf of Mexico on a near loop around the world similar to October\u2019s test flight.

      "It was the sixth test for the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful rocket that SpaceX and NASA hope to use to get astronauts back on the moon and eventually Mars.",
      "SpaceX kept the same flight path as last time, but changed some steps along the way as well as the time of day. Starship blasted off in late afternoon instead of early morning to ensure daylight to see the spacecraft\u2019s descent.",
      "Among the new objectives that were achieved: igniting one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines in space, which would be necessary when returning from orbit. There were also thermal protection experiments aboard the spacecraft, with some areas stripped of heat tiles to see whether catch mechanisms might work there on future flights. And the spacecraft descended nose-first during the last part of entry, before flipping and splashing down upright into the Indian Ocean. Even more upgrades are planned for the next test flight.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The deadliest place for women is at home and 140 women and girls on average were killed by an intimate partner or family member per day last year, two U.N. agencies reported Monday.",
      "Globally, an intimate partner or family member was responsible for the deaths of approximately 51,100 women and girls during 2023, an increase from an estimated 48,800 victims in 2022, UN Women and the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said.",

      "The highest number of intimate partner and family killings was in Africa \u2013 with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023, the report said. Africa also had the highest number of victims relative to the size of its population \u2014 2.9 victims per 100,000 people.",
      "There were also high rates last year in the Americas with 1.6 female victims per 100,000 and in Oceania with 1.5 per 100,000, it said. Rates were significantly lower in Asia at 0.8 victims per 100,000 and Europe at 0.6 per 100,000.",

      "\u201cAn estimated 80% of all homicide victims in 2023 were men while 20% were women, but lethal violence within the family takes a much higher toll on women than men, with almost 60% of all women who were intentionally killed in 2023 being victims of intimate partner/family member homicide,\u201d it said.",
      "The report said that despite efforts to prevent the killing of women and girls by countries, their killings \u201cremain at alarmingly high levels.\u201d",

      "Bessent has advised Trump on economic policy and has been a frequent presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club over the last two weeks.",
      "The announcement for the job, which needs Senate approval, was supposed to come earlier but had been stalled due to intense infighting among Trump's top advisers \u2014 including transition co-chair Howard Lutnick \u2014 about who should get the job.",

      "\"Well, I might even advise him to campaign on three arrows,\" Bessent said. \"It would be 3% real economic growth, and how do you get that?

      "Following news Friday that former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz does not intend to return to Congress after he withdrew from consideration to be President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, it appears his seat will be vacant for months -- presenting a challenge for House Republicans who already maintain a slim majority in the incoming Congress.",
      "On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis set the FL-01 special election primary for Jan. 28 and the general election for April 1. That means Gaetz's seat will be unfilled for at least 12 weeks in the 119th Congress.",
      "\"At Gov. Ron DeSantis' direction, this special election is being conducted as quickly as statutorily possible,\" said Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd on Friday. \"We are committed to ensuring this election is held as soon as we are allowed to hold it by state law.\"",
      "Such a vacancy would cut into the narrow majority House Republicans are projected to have in the next Congress, which will only continue to shrink if GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and Michael Waltz are confirmed to be in Trump's Cabinet.",
      "ABC News projects that Republicans have won 219 seats and Democrats 213 in the House. The numbers do not take into account any departures for jobs in the Trump administration or Gaetz's resignation. There are also three outstanding House races that still haven't been called, which will determine the ultimate size of the GOP's majority.",
      "The special election schedule is at the Florida governor's discretion. For instance, the dates set by DeSantis in 2022 to fill the vacancy of the late Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings left the seat open for nine months, despite Democrats' pushing for a speedier process.",
      "At least half a dozen Florida Republicans have already expressed willingness to run for Gaetz's seat. 538 rates Florida's 1st Congressional District, which Gaetz represented for eight years, as \"solid Republican.\"",
      "Gaetz on Friday sat for his first interview with conservative commentator Charlie Kirk since withdrawing as Trump's attorney general pick. During the interview, the conservative firebrand announced then that he would not return to Congress, despite having won reelection in November by 32 points.",
      "\"I'm going to be fighting for President Trump. I'm going to be doing whatever he asks of me, as I always have,\" Gaetz said. \"But I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump picks Johns Hopkins surgeon Marty Makary, who argued against pandemic lockdowns, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
    "story": [
      "Marty Makary became a GOP favorite for his questioning of COVID restrictions.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and author who argued against pandemic lockdowns, to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "\"He will work under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to, among other things, properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning our Nation\u2019s food supply and drugs and biologics being given to our Nation\u2019s youth, so that we can finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic,\" Trump said in his announcement.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Makary's job would be to oversee the FDA's $7 billion budget and report to the health secretary. The agency oversees $3.6 trillion in food, tobacco and medical products, including some 20,000 prescription drugs on the market.",
      "Here are three things to know about Makary:",
      "Makary is a respected transplant surgeon who questioned his colleagues' recommendations on COVID",
      "Makary was known during the pandemic as an experienced medical expert willing to challenge his colleagues' assumptions on COVID, although he was often criticized by his peers for cherry-picking data or omitting context.",
      "He frequently appeared on Fox News and wrote opinion articles that questioned the value of lockdowns and masks for children. He supported the use of vaccines but opposed mandates and doubted the utility of boosters, at odds with full-throated recommendations on boosters from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Among his views was that the U.S. government was underestimating the number of people who were likely immune to the virus. In early 2021, he predicted much of the country would reach \"herd immunity\" by that April, reducing risk of the virus dramatically.",
      "That assumption, however, did not happen.",
      "As restrictions eased and a new variant surfaced, virus-related deaths soared from about 4,000 a week to about 15,000 a week by September, making 2021 a deadlier year than when the pandemic began.",
      "Makary stood by his assertion that \"natural immunity\" was still being underestimated by the U.S. government.",
      "\"One reason public health officials may be afraid to acknowledge the effectiveness of natural immunity is that they fear it will lead some to choose getting the infection over vaccination. That's a legitimate concern. But we can encourage all Americans to get vaccinated while still being honest about the data,\" he wrote a separate opinion article in The Washington Post.",
      "He sounds a lot like RFK Jr. when talking about the 'poisoned' food supply, pesticides and ultra-processed foods.",
      "After the pandemic, Makary began turning back to his initial focus railing against an overpriced health care system. He's long argued that the system is broken, overcharging patients and running unnecessary tests.",
      "He also began speaking more critically about America's food system, echoing a message embraced by Trump's pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"We've got a poisoned food supply. We've got pesticides. We've got ultra-processed foods and all sorts of things that have been in the blind spots in modern medicine,\" Makary told Fox News this September.",
      "Kennedy also would require Senate confirmation to get the job.",
      "In a later interview, Makary praised Trump's decision to pick Kennedy.",
      "\"He wants to address corruption in health care and corruption in our government health agencies,\" he said.",
      "He warns against 'drugging our nation's children.'",
      "It's not clear exactly what Makary would do if confirmed as FDA commissioner, as much of his work would likely be steered by Trump and the incoming health secretary, possibly Kennedy.",
      "But Makary has previously suggested an overhaul of FDA's \"erratic\" bureaucracy, which he says was too eager to approve opioids and too cautious when it came to other drugs like the COVID antiviral pill Molnupiravir.",
      "\"For too long, FDA leaders have acted like a crusty librarian who gets annoyed when someone wants to borrow a book. But then give preference to people they like,\" Makary wrote in a 2021 opinion article in Fox News.",
      "More recently, he's called for a ban on cell phones on schools, and praised Kennedy for questioning the use of anti-anxiety and anti-obesity drugs in children.",
      "\"What he is really focused on is this concept that we can't keep drugging our nation's children,\" Makary said of Kennedy.",
      "When asked if Kennedy can accomplish what he wants to do in four years, Makary told Fox News he'll try by bringing in more scientists and letting \"them do good work.\"",
      "Kennedy \"is really the quintessential environmental health attorney of our era, and that may be the quintessential issue of our era,\" Makary said.",

She was deployed to Iraq and Kuwait and, according to the Hawaii National Guard, received a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for \u201cparticipation in combat operations under enemy hostile fire in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III.\"",
      "Duckworth's comments drew immediate backlash from Republicans.",
      "\u201cFor her to say ridiculous and outright dangerous words like that is wrong,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, said on CNN, challenging Duckworth to retract her words. \u201cThat\u2019s the most dangerous thing she could say \u2014 is that a United States lieutenant colonel in the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia.\u201d",
      "In recent days, other Democrats have accused Gabbard without evidence of being a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has claimed, without offering details, that Gabbard is in Russian President Vladimir \u201cPutin\u2019s pocket.\u201d",
      "Mullin and others say the criticism from Democrats is rooted in the fact that Gabbard left their party and has become a Trump ally. Democrats say they worry that Gabbard's selection as national intelligence chief endangers ties with allies and gives Russia a win.",
      "Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat just elected to the Senate, said he would not describe Gabbard as a Russian asset, but said she had \u201cvery questionable judgment.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is if our foreign allies don\u2019t trust the head of our intelligence agencies, they\u2019ll stop sharing information with us,\u201d Schiff said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Gabbard in 2022 endorsed one of Russia\u2019s justifications for invading Ukraine: the existence of dozens of U.S.-funded biolabs working on some of the world\u2019s nastiest pathogens. The labs are part of an international effort to control outbreaks and stop bioweapons, but Moscow claimed Ukraine was using them to create deadly bioweapons. Gabbard said she just voiced concerns about protecting the labs.",
      "Gabbard also has suggested that Russia had legitimate security concerns in deciding to invade Ukraine, given its desire to join NATO.",
      "Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said he thought it was \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d that Gabbard was being cast as a Russian asset for having different political views.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s a slur, quite frankly. There\u2019s no evidence that she\u2019s a asset of another country,\u201d he said on NBC.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, another Oklahoma Republican, acknowledged having \u201clots of questions\u201d for Gabbard as the Senate considers her nomination to lead the intelligence services. Lankford said on NBC that he wants to ask Gabbard about her meeting with Assad and some of her past comments about Russia.",
      "\u201cWe want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was. As a member of Congress, we want to get a chance to talk about past comments that she\u2019s made and get them into full context,\u201d Lankford said.",

      "Bondi was also a supporter of Trump's false claims regarding the 2020 election, helping file several unsuccessful lawsuits alleging voter fraud.",
      "She appeared alongside Rudy Giuliani in Philadelphia the day after the 2020 race declaring Trump \"won Pennsylvania\" while votes were still being counted. The state went for President Biden by roughly 80,000 votes.",

      "Drivers should get a slight break on gas prices. The nationwide average price for gasoline was $3.06 a gallon on Sunday, down from $3.27 at this time last year.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18.3 million people at U.S. airports during the same seven-day stretch. That would be 6% more than during the corresponding days last year but fit a pattern set throughout 2024.",
      "The TSA predicts that 3 million people will pass through airport security checkpoints on Sunday; more than that could break the record of 3.01 million set on the Sunday after the July Fourth holiday. Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to be the next-busiest air travel days of Thanksgiving week.",
      "\u201cThis will be the busiest Thanksgiving ever in terms of air travel,\u201d TSA Administrator David Pekoske said. \u201cFortunately, our staffing is also at the highest levels that they have ever been. We are ready.\u201d",
      "Pekoske said TSA will have enough screeners to keep general security lines under 30 minutes and lines for people who pay extra for PreCheck under 10 minutes.",
      "However, an ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers could cause flight delays.",
      "Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Mike Whitaker said last week that he expects his agency to use special measures to deal with shortages at some facilities. In the past, that has included airports in New York City and Florida.",
      "\u201cIf we are short on staff, we will slow traffic as needed to keep the system safe,\u201d Whitaker said.",
      "The FAA has long struggled with a shortage of controllers that airline officials expect will last for years, despite the agency's lofty hiring goals.",
      "Thanksgiving Day takes place late this year, with the fourth Thursday of November falling on Nov. 28. That shortens the traditional shopping season and changes the rhythm of holiday travel.",
      "With more time before the holiday, people tend to spread out their outbound travel over more days, but everyone returns at the same time, said Andrew Watterson, the chief operating officer of Southwest Airlines.",
      "\u201cA late Thanksgiving leads to a big crush at the end \u2014 the Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday after Thanksgiving are usually very busy with Thanksgiving this late,\" Watterson said.",
      "Airlines did a relatively good job of handling holiday crowds last year, when the weather was mild in most of the country. Fewer than 400 U.S. flights were canceled during Thanksgiving week in 2023 \u2014 about one of every 450 flights. So far in 2024, airlines have canceled about 1.3% of all flights.",
      "The rise of remote work also has caused the Thanksgiving travel period to expand, AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic changed everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we have seen is that post-pandemic, people are leaving at certain times, perhaps even leaving the weekend before Thanksgiving, working remotely from their destination a couple of days, and then enjoying time with their loved ones.\u201d",
      "Nightmares of Thanksgivings past have further shaped holiday traffic jams. Motorists who learned to avoid traveling the day before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving have created new bottlenecks on other days, according to Diaz.",
      "\u201cBecause we warned for so long (that) Wednesday and Sunday are the worst days to travel, people were like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to leave on Tuesday and come back on Monday to avoid the rush,\u2019\" she said. \u201cSo now those two days are congested as well.\u201d",
      "Airport security officials are pleading with passengers to arrive early, not to put lithium-ion batteries in checked bags in case they overheat, and to keep guns out of carry-on bags. TSA has discovered more than 6,000 guns at checkpoints this year, and most of them were loaded.",
      "Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas bring out many infrequent travelers, and they often have questions about what they can bring on the plane.",
      "TSA has a list on its website of items that are banned or restricted.",
      "Drivers should know that Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons will be the worst times to travel by car, but it should be smooth sailing on freeways come Thanksgiving Day, according to transportation analytics company INRIX.",
      "On the return home, the best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday, and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday, the company said.",
      "In metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle and Washington, \u201ctraffic is expected to be more than double what it typically is on a normal day,\u201d INRIX transportation analyst Bob Pishue said."

      "Travel, especially during the holiday season, can be stressful",
      "Travel can be stressful in the best of times. Now add in the high-level anxiety that seems to be baked into every holiday season and it's clear that travelers could use some help calming frazzled nerves.",
      "Travel pros say there is plenty you can do ahead of time to make for a happier and less-stressful holiday journey.",
      "A week before you leave, write down things you need to bring and tasks you need to do before the trip.",
      "\u201cThis can include essential packing items, as well as simple tasks like cleaning out old food from the fridge or watering the plants,\u201d says Jess Feldman, special projects editor at Travel and Leisure magazine. \u201cThe key is to leave the list out for the entire week before you go. I cross the to-dos off throughout the week, and it helps me feel extremely prepared, lessening the stress every time.\u201d",
      "Noise-canceling headphones can go a long way toward blocking out annoyances during travel, although if you use them you should keep an eye on display boards or your phone for any flight or gate changes.",
      "Spotify, YouTube and other sites offer music playlists with names like \u201cRelaxing Chill Out Calming Music for Airports\u201d and \u201cPerfect \u2014 Music Travel Relax.\" Or try \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d a groundbreaking album that launched the ambient music genre in 1978.",
      "It\u2019s also good to carry extra medications, a change of clothes, a toothbrush and a phone-charging cable, just in case.",
      "Bringing along some snacks or a sandwich from home can feel comforting and be a great alternative to pricey airport offerings.",
      "\u201cI tend to pack for worst-case scenarios, such as flight delays and cancellations. This includes bringing things to do of course, like more than one book, knitting materials, or a few extra downloaded movies,\u201d Feldman says. For longer journeys, she might bring a meal in a Tupperware container.",
      "To counter the dry air on flights, bring along an empty water bottle (fill it after you go through security ) and a small pouch with lip balm and travel-size moisturizers.",
      "Hallie Gould, editor in chief of Byrdie, a digital site for beauty care, recommends \u201cloading up on skin hydration before your flight. That means drinking extra fluids and applying moisturizing skin products to boost hydration, so you\u2019re covering your bases inside and out.\u201d",
      "And don\u2019t forget your hair.",
      "\u201cJust as the low humidity on the airplane is dehydrating for your skin, it can also dry out your hair. If possible, use a deep conditioner before your trip,\u201d Gould says.",
      "\u201cEvery airline has different requirements when it comes to the boarding process, paying for perks in advance, or seat upgrades,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to understand all of the above before getting to the airport so that you are not taken off guard.\u201d",
      "Having the airline's app lets you know about gate changes, flight delays or cancellations sooner and allows you to more quickly find alternative flights or connections if needed.",
      "Security lines can be much longer \u2014 and slower \u2014 than expected, and so can the walk through a large airport. So giving yourself plenty of extra time can reduce stress. The general rule of thumb is to arrive at the airport two hours before departure for domestic flights and three hours before international flights.",
      "If you\u2019re too early, you can always explore the airport shops and lounges or settle in with a good book somewhere.",
      "\u201cI always confirm whether or not there is a lounge I have access to in my departing gate ahead of time,\u201d Feldman says. But even without lounge access, she says, \"I like to know what the restaurants and waiting areas (near) the gate are like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you have a sense of why you are feeling stressed, it can help to figure out ways to reduce that stress,\" says Lynn F. Bufka, head of practice for the American Psychological Association. \"So if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, are there things that you can outsource? Is there someone in your family who can help with parts of the planning?\u201d",
      "Recognize that crowds, bad weather and canceled flights are beyond your control.",
      "And some people just don't like to travel far or to fly.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s fear, like fear of flying, it\u2019s important to know that it can be treated, and that treatment can really improve the quality of your life,\u201d Bufka says.",
      "A little extra time tidying your home and making sure you have some easy-to-prepare food ready in the freezer or pantry will make for a much more welcoming return.",
      "\u201cAlways, always, always clean your space before leaving for a trip. You are inevitably going to feel a bit off after a long travel day, and coming home to an unorganized space will make it so much worse,\u201d Feldman says.",
      "Wash the sheets, take out the trash, put away clothes, clean the countertops. \u201cArriving home to a neat and tidy space is the best homecoming, especially after a long time away,\u201d she says.",

    "summary": "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook &ldquo;Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,&rdquo; has died",
    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "story": [
      "The last meatpackers in New York's Meatpacking District have agreed to end their leases early and make way for development on their city-owned lot",
      "NEW YORK -- When John Jobbagy\u2019s grandfather immigrated from Budapest in 1900, he joined a throng of European butchers chopping up and shipping off meat in a loud, smelly corner of Manhattan that New Yorkers called the Meatpacking District.",
      "Today only a handful of meatpackers remain, and they're preparing to say goodbye to a very different neighborhood, known more for its high-end boutiques and expensive restaurants than the industry that gave it its name.",
      "Jobbagy and the other tenants in the district\u2019s last meat market have accepted a deal from the city to move out so the building can be redeveloped, the culmination of a decades-long transformation.",
      "\u201cThe neighborhood I grew up in is just all memories,\u201d said Jobbagy, 68. \u201cIt\u2019s been gone for over 20 years.\u201d",
      "In its heyday, it was a gritty hub of over 200 slaughterhouses and packing plants at the intersection of shipping and train lines, where meat and poultry were unloaded, cut and moved quickly to markets. Now the docks are recreation areas and an abandoned freight line is the High Line park. The Whitney Museum of American Art moved from Madison Avenue next to Jobbagy's meat company in 2015.",
      "Some of the new retailers maintain reminders of the neighborhood\u2019s meat-packing past. At the exposed brick entrance to an outlet of fashion brand Rag & Bone, which sells $300 leather belts, is a carefully restored sign from a previous occupant, \u201cDave\u2019s Quality Veal,\u201d in red and white hand-painted lettering.",
      "Another sign for a wholesale meat supplier appears on a long building awning outside Samsung\u2019s U.S. flagship phone store.",
      "But the neighborhood no longer sounds, smells or feels like the place where Jobbagy began working for his father in the late 1960s. He worked through high school and college summers before going into business for himself.",
      "Back then, meatpackers kept bottles of whiskey in their lockers to stay warm inside the refrigerated plants. Outside, \u201cit reeked,\u201d he said, especially on hot days near the poultry houses where chicken juices spilled into the streets.",
      "People only visited the neighborhood if they had business, usually transacting in handshake deals, he said.",
      "Slowly but surely, meatpacking plants began closing or moving out of Manhattan as advances in refrigeration and packaging enabled the meat industry to consolidate around packing plants in the Midwest, many of which can butcher and package more than 5,000 steers in a day and ship directly to supermarkets.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, a new nightlife scene emerged as bars and nightclubs moved in, many catering to the LGBTQ+ community. Sex clubs and slaughterhouses coexisted. And as the decades wore on, the drag queens and club kids began giving way to fashion designers and restaurateurs.",
      "By 2000, \u201cSex and The City\u201d character Samantha had left her Upper East Side apartment for a new home in the Meatpacking District. By the show's final 2003 season, she was outraged to see a Pottery Barn slated to open near a local leather bar.",
      "Another turning point came with the 2009 opening of the High Line, on a defunct rail track originally built in the 1930s. The popular greenway is now flanked by hotels, galleries and luxury apartment buildings.",
      "Jobbagy said his father died five years before the opening and would be baffled at what it looks like now.",
      "\u201cIf I told him that the elevated railroad was going to be turned into a public park, he never would have believed it,\u201d he said.",
      "But the area has changed constantly, noted Andrew Berman, executive director of local architectural preservation group Village Preservation.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t always a meatpacking district. It was a sort of wholesale produce district before that, and it was a shipping district before that,\" Berman said. In the early 1800s, Fort Gansevoort stood there. \"So it\u2019s had many lives and it\u2019s going to continue to have new lives.\u201d",
      "Though an exact eviction date for the last meat market has not been set, some of the other companies will relocate elsewhere.",
      "Not Jobbagy, who has held on by supplying high-end restaurants and the few retail stores that still want fresh hanging meat. He\u2019ll retire, along with his brother and his employees, most of them Latino immigrants who trained with him and saved up to buy second homes in Honduras, Mexico or the Dominican Republic. Some want to move to other industries, in other states.",
      "He expects to be the last meatpacker standing when the cleaver finally falls on Gansevoort Market.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be here when this building closes, when everybody, you know, moves on to something else,\" Jobbagy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad I was part of it and I didn\u2019t leave before.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and Google are set to make closing arguments in a trial alleging Google\u2019s online advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly",
      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Google, already facing a possible breakup of the company over its ubiquitous search engine, is fighting to beat back another attack by the U.S. Department of Justice alleging monopolistic conduct, this time over technology that puts online advertising in front of consumers.",
      "The Justice Department and Google are scheduled to make closing arguments Monday in a trial alleging Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, will decide the case and is expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the year. If Brinkema finds Google has engaged in illegal, monopolistic conduct, she will then hold further hearings to explore what remedies should be imposed.",
      "The Justice Department, along with a coalition of states, has already said it believes Google should be forced to sell off its ad tech business, which generates tens of billions of dollars annually for the Mountain View, California-based company.",
      "After roughly a month of trial testimony earlier this year, the arguments in the case remain the same.",
      "The Justice Department contends Google built and maintained a monopoly in \u201copen-web display advertising,\u201d essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of the page when one browses websites.",
      "Google dominates all facets of the market: A technology called \u201cDoubleClick\u201d is used pervasively by news sites and other online publishers, while \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d maintains a cache of advertisers large and small looking to place their ads on the right webpage in front of the right consumer.",
      "In between is another Google product, AdExchange, that conducts nearly instantaneous auctions matching advertisers to publishers.",
      "In court papers, Justice Department lawyers say Google \u201cis more concerned with acquiring and preserving its trifecta of monopolies than serving its own publisher and advertiser customers or winning on the merits.\u201d",
      "As a result, content providers and news organizations have never been able to generate the online revenue they should due to Google\u2019s excessive fees for brokering transactions between advertisers and publishers, the government says.",
      "Google argues the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow niche of online advertising. If one looks more broadly at online advertising to include social media, streaming TV services, and app-based advertising, Google says it controls only 25% of the market, a share that is dwindling as it faces increased and evolving competition.",

      "Donald Trump\u2019s personnel choices for his new Cabinet and White House reflect his signature positions on immigration and trade but also a range of viewpoints and backgrounds that raise questions about what ideological anchors might guide his Oval Office...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump\u2019s personnel choices for his new Cabinet and White House reflect his signature positions on immigration and trade but also a range of viewpoints and backgrounds that raise questions about what ideological anchors might guide his Oval Office encore.",
      "With a rapid assembly of his second administration \u2014 faster than his effort eight years ago \u2014 the former and incoming president has combined television personalities, former Democrats, a wrestling executive and traditional elected Republicans into a mix that makes clear his intentions to impose tariffs on imported goods and crack down on illegal immigration but leaves open a range of possibilities on other policy pursuits.",
      "\u201cThe president has his two big priorities and doesn\u2019t feel as strongly about anything else \u2014 so it\u2019s going to be a real jump ball and zigzag,\u201d predicted Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence during Trump\u2019s 2017-21 term. \u201cIn the first administration, he surrounded himself with more conservative thinkers, and the results showed we were mostly rowing in the same direction. This is more eclectic.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Secretary of State-designee Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who has pilloried authoritarian regimes around the world, is in line to serve as top diplomat to a president who praises autocratic leaders like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban.",
      "Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon has been tapped to sit at the Cabinet table as a pro-union labor secretary alongside multiple billionaires, former governors and others who oppose making it easier for workers to organize themselves.",
      "The prospective treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, wants to cut deficits for a president who promised more tax cuts, better veterans services and no rollbacks of the largest federal outlays: Social Security, Medicare and national defense.",
      "Abortion-rights supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is Trump's choice to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which Trump\u2019s conservative Christian base has long targeted as an agency where the anti-abortion movement must wield more influence.",
      "Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich allowed that members of Trump\u2019s slate will not always agree with the president and certainly not with one another. But he minimized the potential for irreconcilable differences: \u201cA strong Cabinet, by definition, means you\u2019re going to have people with different opinions and different skills.\u201d",
      "That kind of unpredictability is at the core of Trump\u2019s political identity. He is the erstwhile reality TV star who already upended Washington once and is returning to power with sweeping, sometimes contradictory promises that convinced voters, especially those in the working class, that he will do it all again.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump has done is reorient political leadership and activism to a more entrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "There's also plenty of room for conflict, given the breadth of Trump's 2024 campaign promises and his pattern of cycling through Cabinet members and national security personnel during his first term.",
      "This time, Trump has pledged to impose tariffs on foreign goods, end illegal immigration and launch a mass deportation force, goose U.S. energy production and exact retribution on people who opposed \u2014 and prosecuted \u2014 him. He's added promises to cut taxes, raise wages, end wars in Israel and Ukraine, streamline government, protect Social Security and Medicare, help veterans and squelch cultural progressivism.",
      "Trump alluded to some of those promises in recent weeks as he completed his proposed roster of federal department heads and named top White House staff members. But his announcements skimmed over any policy paradoxes or potential complications.",
      "Bessent has crusaded as a deficit hawk, warning that the ballooning national debt, paired with higher interest rates, drives consumer inflation. But he also supports extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts that added to the overall debt and annual debt service payments to investors who buy Treasury notes.",
      "A hedge-fund billionaire, Bessent built his wealth in world markets. Yet, generally speaking, he\u2019s endorsed Trump's tariffs. He rejects the idea that they feed inflation and instead frames tariffs as one-time price adjustments and leverage to achieve U.S. foreign policy and domestic economic aims.",
      "Trump, for his part, declared that Bessent would \u201chelp me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States.\u201d",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, Trump promised, \u201cwill achieve historic cooperation between Business and Labor that will restore the American Dream for Working Families.\u201d",
      "Trump did not address the Oregon congresswoman\u2019s staunch support for the PRO-Act, a Democratic-backed measure that would make it easier for workers to unionize, among other provisions. That proposal passed the House when Democrats held a majority. But it\u2019s never had measurable Republican support in either chamber on Capitol Hill, and Trump has never made it part of his agenda.",
      "When Trump named Kennedy as his pick for health secretary, he did not mention the former Democrat\u2019s support for abortion rights. Instead, Trump put the focus on Kennedy\u2019s intention to take on the U.S. agriculture, food processing and drug manufacturing sectors.",
      "The vagaries of Trump\u2019s foreign policy stand out, as well. Trump's choice for national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, offered mixed messages Sunday when discussing the Russia-Ukraine war, which Trump claims never would have started had he been president, because he would have prevailed on Putin not to invade his neighboring country.",
      "Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Waltz repeated Trump\u2019s concerns over recent escalations, which include President Joe Biden approving sending antipersonnel mines to Ukrainian forces.",
      "\u201cWe need to restore deterrence, restore peace and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it,\u201d Waltz said. But in the same interview, Waltz declared the mines necessary to help Ukraine \u201cstop Russian gains\u201d and said he\u2019s working \u201chand in glove\u201d with Biden\u2019s team during the transition.",
      "Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, the top intelligence post in government, is an outspoken defender of Putin and Syrian President Bashar al Assad, a close ally of Russia and Iran.",
      "Perhaps the biggest wildcards of Trump\u2019s governing constellation are budget-and-spending advisers Russell Vought, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Vought led Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget in his first term and is in line for the same post again. Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man, and Ramaswamy, a mega-millionaire venture capitalist, are leading an outside advisory panel known as the \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency.\u201d",
      "The latter effort is a quasi-official exercise to identify waste. It carries no statutory authority, but Trump can route Musk\u2019s and Ramaswamy\u2019s recommendations to official government pathways, including via Vought.",
      "A leading author of Project 2025, the conservative movement\u2019s blueprint for a hard-right turn in U.S. government and society, Vought envisions OMB not just as an influential office to shape Trump\u2019s budget proposals for Congress but a power center of the executive branch, \u201cpowerful enough to override implementing agencies\u2019 bureaucracies.\u201d",
      "As for how Trump might navigate differences across his administration, Gingrich pointed to Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "\u201cHe might not agree with her on union issues, but he might not stop her from pushing it herself,\u201d Gingrich said of the PRO-Act. \u201cAnd he will listen to anybody. If you convince him, he absolutely will spend presidential capital.\u201d",
      "Short said other factors are more likely to influence Trump: personalities and, of course, loyalty.",
      "Vought \u201cbrought him potential spending cuts\u201d in the first administration, Short said, \u201cthat Trump wouldn\u2019t go along with.\u201d This time, Short continued, \u201cmaybe Elon and Vivek provide backup,\u201d giving Vought the imprimatur of two wealthy businessmen.",
      "\u201cHe will always calculate who has been good to him,\u201d Short said. \u201cYou already see that: The unions got the labor secretary they wanted, and Putin and Assad got the DNI (intelligence chief) they wanted. \u2026 This is not so much a team-of-rivals situation. I think it\u2019s going to look a lot like a reality TV show.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The withdrawal of Matt Gaetz as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general serves as a reminder that the Senate is still relevant when it comes to installing a president\u2019s Cabinet",
      "WASHINGTON -- It's a short phrase in the Constitution, mentioned in passing. But it's already taking on an outsize significance as President-elect Donald Trump charts his return to office.",
      "The withdrawal of Matt Gaetz as Trump's nominee for attorney general dramatically affirmed that the Senate still maintains its \u201cadvice and consent\u201d powers when it comes to vetting and installing a president's Cabinet. Yet it may be only a brief reprieve from the intense struggles to come as Senate Republicans try to preserve their constitutional role.",
      "Trump has been making his Cabinet announcements at a rapid clip, often over social media, and frequently catching GOP senators off guard. Gaetz\u2019s selection on Nov. 13, in particular, left Republicans shocked and momentarily dumbfounded. His withdrawal just over a week later came just as suddenly, leaving many grasping for words.",
      "Within hours, Trump had moved on, announcing on social media that he had selected another loyalist, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, to run the Justice Department. Over the weekend, Trump filled out the rest of his Cabinet selections.",
      "The dizzying speed of the picks has given Trump's second term in office a bracing start, a show of force from a president-elect who has made clear he intends to fill his administration with officials who are willing to upend the ways of Washington. His desire to pack the government with loyalists and wield executive power in expansive ways seems certain to result in frequent clashes with Congress, even with Republicans in control.",
      "\u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Republican senators are choosing their words carefully as they size up Trump's proposed Cabinet, while also issuing gentle reminders about their role in the confirmation process.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional directive is clear, and it does not change based upon the personalities involved,\u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. \u201cThe way I approach it, the president has a responsibility to make nominations, and we give him the benefit of the doubt, but we do have a responsibility for \u2018advice and consent.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gaetz's nomination was sunk after Republican senators had privately become wary of a volatile confirmation hearing amid allegations he had sex with an underage girl. As many as four to six GOP senators were signaling their reservations, according to one outgoing Republican senator, Mike Braun of Indiana, though the number was certainly higher.",
      "With Democrats ready to oppose Cabinet nominees they view as unqualified and extreme, Trump's margin for error is narrow. Republicans are set to have a 53-47 majority in the next Senate, so defections from just four Republicans would mean defeat for any nominee that doesn't enjoy bipartisan support.",
      "Other Cabinet picks also face a complicated path to confirmation. Trump's transition team has so far not signed the requisite agreements that allow the FBI to screen his personnel choices, sending nominees before the Senate without the typical vetting that happens beforehand.",
      "So far, Trump's nominees have included for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality who was accused of sexual assault, which he denies; for secretary for health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has also faced allegations of sexual misconduct as well as concern about his opposition to vaccines; and for national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic House member who has echoed Russian propaganda and talking points.",
      "Those picks fall outside the Republican mainstream and are a notable departure from when Trump entered the White House the first time and mostly chose from the ranks of Republican officials well-respected across Washington.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution gives us a role in personnel called \u2018advice and consent,\u2019\u201d said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the outgoing Senate Republican leader who will remain in office next year. \u201cMy view is that's exactly what will unfold here when these nominees are actually sent forward, and we will treat them like we've treated all others with proper vetting.\u201d",
      "Still, Trump's allies argue that senators need to be ready to confirm the Cabinet, no matter who is chosen.",
      "\u201cThe president deserves to be able to put people in place who will do what he campaigned on, which is to disrupt, and the establishment is concerned, and they probably should be,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican, adding, \u201cI fully support President Trump's ability to pick his people to go do that.\u201d",
      "After Gaetz's withdrawal, Trump supporters on social media and in activist circles circulated the names of Republicans they believed were holding out support. Charlie Kirk, whose conservative youth organization Turning Points Action worked closely with the Trump campaign, is already organizing a \u201cgrassroots army\u201d to pressure senators to confirm his nominees.",
      "That might not even matter. Trump has also demanded that Senate Republicans agree to allow him to make recess appointments, a process whereby the Senate would adjourn so that Trump could use a constitutional power to make appointments while the chamber is in recess. Sen. John Thune, who will take over as Senate majority leader in January, has kept that option on the table, saying he would be inclined to use it if Democrats try to delay confirmations.",
      "It would be unprecedented in modern times for the Senate to step aside willingly to allow the president to make top-level Cabinet appointments. Experts say it would amount to surrendering the chamber's constitutional power over Cabinet choices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crystallized the choices for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. \u201cWho is your loyalty to and how far are you willing to put your loyalty to President Trump above your procedural rights and constitutional powers?\u201d",
      "Yet some Trump allies have also discussed a scenario where the Republican-controlled House could vote to adjourn Congress. Even if the Senate declined to adjourn also, that could theoretically create a \u201cdisagreement\u201d between the two chambers, which allows the president to tap a constitutional authority to adjourn Congress until a time he thinks is \u201cproper.\u201d",
      "Still, that constitutional provision has never been tried, and Binder asserted that it would still be within the Senate leaders' ability to promptly call the chamber back into session. But it would also be a further test for the senators.",
      "\u201cA constitutional system doesn\u2019t work unless those in the institutions stand up and fight to maintain their constitutional rights of advice and consent,\u201d said Binder.",

      "Fred Harris, a former Democratic U.S. senator from Oklahoma, is being remembered by party members for his commitment to social and economic justice",
      "Oklahoma residents on Sunday mourned the death of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Fred Harris, a trailblazer in progressive politics in the state who ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 1976. Harris died on Saturday at 94.",
      "Democratic Party members across Oklahoma remembered Harris for his commitment to economic and social justice during the 1960s \u2014 a period of historical turbulence. Harris chaired the Democratic National Committee from 1969 to 1970 and helped unify the party after its tumultuous national convention in 1968 when protesters and police clashed in Chicago.",
      "\u201cFred Harris showed us what is possible when we lead with both heart and principle. He worked to ensure everyone had a voice and a seat at the table,\u201d said Alicia Andrews, chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party.",
      "Harris appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago earlier this year as a guest speaker for the Oklahoma delegation, where he reflected on progress and unity.",
      "\"Standing alongside him in Chicago this summer was a reminder of how his legacy continues to inspire,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Kalyn Free, a member of the Choctaw nation of Oklahoma and the DNC, said that there is no one else in public service whom she admired more than the former senator.",
      "\u201cHe was a friend, a mentor, a hero and my True North. Oklahoma and America have lost a powerful advocate and voice,\u201d Free said in a statement. \u201cHis work for Indian Country will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "\u201cSenator Harris truly was an Oklahoma treasure and was ahead of his time in so many ways,\u201d said Jeff Berrong, whose grandfather served in the state Senate with Harris. \u201cHe never forgot where he came from and he always remained focused on building a society that would provide equality of opportunity for all.\u201d",
      "Harris served eight years in the state Senate before he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served another eight years before his 1976 presidential campaign. State party leaders commemorated his work on the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, or the Kerner Commission, to investigate the 1960s riots. Harris was the last surviving member of the commission.",
      "Shortly after his presidential campaign, Harris left politics and moved to New Mexico and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico.",

      "Forecasters in the U.S. have warned of another round of wintry weather that could complicate travel leading up to Thanksgiving",
      "WINDSOR, Calif. -- Another round of wintry weather could complicate travel leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, according to forecasts across the U.S., while California and Washington state continue to recover from storm damage and power outages.",
      "In California, where two people were found dead in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more rain while grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm.",
      "The National Weather Service office in Sacramento, California, issued a winter storm warning for the Sierra Nevada through Tuesday, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Total snowfall of roughly 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations expected Monday and Tuesday.",
      "The Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, forecasters said.",
      "A low pressure system is forecast to bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast. Areas from Boston to New York could see rain and breezy conditions, with snowfall possible in parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. If the system tracks further inland, there could be less snow and more rain in the mountains, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t look like a powerhouse right now,\u201d Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the weather service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. \u201cBasically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travelers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.\u201d",
      "Frank said he isn't seeing any major storm systems arriving for the weekend anywhere in the country so travelers heading home Sunday can expect good driving conditions. Temperatures, however, will get colder in the East while warming up out West.",
      "Two people died in the Pacific Northwest after a rapidly intensifying \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d hit the West Coast last Tuesday, bringing fierce winds that toppled trees and power lines and damaged homes and cars. Hundreds of thousands lost electricity in Washington state before powerful gusts and record rains moved into Northern California. Fewer than 25,000 people in the Seattle area were still without power Sunday evening.",
      "Two bodies were found Saturday in Sonoma County wine country, north of San Francisco, authorities said. Someone walking on a trail near Santa Rosa found the body of a man in a swollen creek, according to the sheriff's department. Hours later, rescue crews recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters in nearby Guerneville, Deputy Rob Dillion said. Investigators are trying to determine if the deaths were storm-related.",
      "Santa Rosa saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 12.5 inches (32 centimeters) of rain by Friday evening, the National Weather Service in the San Francisco Bay Area reported. Vineyards in nearby Windsor were flooded.",
      "Forecasters said the risk of flooding and mudslides remained as the region gets more rain starting Sunday. But the latest storm won't be as intense as last week's atmospheric river, a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land.",
      "\u201cHowever, there\u2019s still threats, smaller threats, and not as significant in terms of magnitude, that are still going to exist across the West Coast for the next two or three days,\u201d weather service forecaster Rich Otto said.",
      "As the rain moves east throughout the week, Otto said, there\u2019s a potential for heavy snowfall at higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, as well as portions of Utah and Colorado.",
      "California's Mammoth Mountain, which received 2 feet (.6 meters) of fresh snow in the recent storm, could get another 4 feet (1.2 meters) before the newest system clears out Wednesday, the resort said.",
      "Into Thanksgiving, parts of the Midwest and East Coast can expect to see heavy rain, and there\u2019s potential for snow in Northeastern states.",
      "A storm last week brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. The precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a drought buster, but it\u2019s definitely going to help,\u201d said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York.",
      "Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 17 inches (43 centimeters), with lesser accumulations in valley cities including Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Around 35,000 customers in 10 counties were still without power, down from 80,000 a day ago.",
      "In the Catskills region of New York, nearly 10,000 people remained without power Sunday morning, two days after a storm dumped heavy snow on parts of the region.",
      "Precipitation in West Virginia helped put a dent in the state\u2019s worst drought in at least two decades and boosted ski resorts as they prepare to open in the weeks ahead."

    "story": [
      "A judge will decide whether new evidence warrants a re-examination of the convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez in the shotgun murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home more than 30 years ago",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge will decide Monday whether new evidence warrants a re-examination of the convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez in the shotgun murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home more than 30 years ago.",
      "The brothers were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. While their defense attorneys argued at trial that they had been sexually abused by their father, prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success.",
      "Now, at 53 and 56, Erik and Lyle Menendez are making a new bid for freedom. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition \u2014 a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained \u2014 in May 2023, asking a judge to consider new evidence of their father's sexual abuse. \u201cNewly discovered evidence directly supports the defense presented at trial,\u201d the petition said.",
      "The recent releases of the Netflix drama \u201c Monsters: Lyle and Erik Menendez Story \u201d and the documentary \u201cThe Menendez Brothers\" in 2024 brought renewed public attention to their plight. Members of the public will be given the opportunity to win a seat in the courtroom to catch a glimpse of the brothers, who will be appearing virtually.",
      "Prosecutors recommended resentencing for the brothers last month, saying they have worked on redemption and rehabilitation and demonstrated good behavior inside prison.",
      "Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n held a news conference less than two weeks before Election Day, asking for new sentences of 50 years to life. This could make them immediately eligible for parole because they were less than 26 years old when they killed their parents.",
      "Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic is scheduled to consider the resentencing request on Dec. 11, but on Monday, he'll first address the abuse evidence raised in the habeas petition. Immediate freedom is one possible result; the judge also might weigh in on the merits of the evidence. And if the brothers don\u2019t get relief in court, they can hope California\u2019s governor will grant them clemency.",
      "The new evidence includes a letter Erik Menendez wrote in 1988 to his uncle Andy Cano, describing the sexual abuse he had endured from his father. The brothers asked their lawyers about it after it was mentioned in a 2015 Barbara Walters television special. The lawyers hadn't known of the letter and realized it had not been introduced at their trials, making it effectively new evidence that they say corroborates allegations that Erik was sexually abused by his father.",
      "More new evidence emerged when Roy Rossello, a former member of the Latin pop group Menudo, recently came forward saying he had been drugged and raped by Jose Menendez, the boys\u2019 father, when he was a teen in the 1980s. Menudo was signed under RCA Records, where Jose Menendez was chief operating officer.",
      "Rossello spoke about his abuse in the Peacock docuseries \u201cMenendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed,\" and provided a signed declaration to the brothers\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Had these two pieces of evidence been available during the brothers' trial, prosecutors would not have been able to argue that there was no corroboration of sexual abuse, or that their father Jose Menendez was not the \u201ckind of man that would\u201d abuse children, the petition argues.",
      "While clemency might be another pathway to freedom for the brothers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week that he won't decide until incoming Los Angeles district attorney Nathan Hochman reviews the case. Hochman, a Republican-turned-Independent who unseated the progressive Gasc\u00f3n on Dec. 2, has said he wants to carefully look at the evidence before making any decisions."

      "Two U.N. agencies say an average of 140 women and girls were killed by an intimate partner or family member per day last year",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The deadliest place for women is at home and 140 women and girls on average were killed by an intimate partner or family member per day last year, two U.N. agencies reported Monday.",
      "Globally, an intimate partner or family member was responsible for the deaths of approximately 51,100 women and girls during 2023, an increase from an estimated 48,800 victims in 2022, UN Women and the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said.",
      "The report released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women said the increase was largely the result of more data being available from countries and not more killings.",
      "But the two agencies stressed that \u201cWomen and girls everywhere continue to be affected by this extreme form of gender-based violence and no region is excluded.\u201d And they said, \u201cthe home is the most dangerous place for women and girls.\u201d",
      "The highest number of intimate partner and family killings was in Africa \u2013 with an estimated 21,700 victims in 2023, the report said. Africa also had the highest number of victims relative to the size of its population \u2014 2.9 victims per 100,000 people.",
      "There were also high rates last year in the Americas with 1.6 female victims per 100,000 and in Oceania with 1.5 per 100,000, it said. Rates were significantly lower in Asia at 0.8 victims per 100,000 and Europe at 0.6 per 100,000.",
      "According to the report, the intentional killing of women in the private sphere in Europe and the Americas is largely by intimate partners.",
      "By contrast, the vast majority of male homicides take place outside homes and families, it said.",
      "\u201cEven though men and boys account for the vast majority of homicide victims, women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by lethal violence in the private sphere,\" the report said.",
      "\u201cAn estimated 80% of all homicide victims in 2023 were men while 20% were women, but lethal violence within the family takes a much higher toll on women than men, with almost 60% of all women who were intentionally killed in 2023 being victims of intimate partner/family member homicide,\u201d it said.",
      "The report said that despite efforts to prevent the killing of women and girls by countries, their killings \u201cremain at alarmingly high levels.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are often the culmination of repeated episodes of gender-based violence, which means they are preventable through timely and effective interventions,\u201d the two agencies said."

      "Jones alleges fraud and collusion marred the bankruptcy auction in which The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with him.",
      "It's not clear how soon U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will issue a ruling. He could allow The Onion to move forward with the sale, order a new auction or name the other bidder as the winner. At stake is whether Jones gets to stay at Infowars\u2019 studio in Austin, Texas, under a new owner friendly to him, or whether he gets kicked out by The Onion.",
      "The other bidder, First United American Companies, runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements.",
      "Regardless, Jones has set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts that would allow him keep airing his show. And his personal account with 3.3 million followers on the social platform X was not part of the sale, although Lopez will be deciding whether it should be included in the liquidation and sold off later.",
      "Jones' bankruptcy and the liquidation of his assets came about after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion to relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Jones was found liable for defamation and emotional distress damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas for repeatedly calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Proceeds from the liquidation are to go to Jones creditors, including the Sandy Hook families who sued him.",
      "Jones alleged The Onion\u2019s bid was the result of fraud and collusion involving many of those families, the humor site and a court-appointed trustee who is overseeing the liquidation.",
      "First United American Companies submitted a $3.5 million sealed bid, while The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash. But The Onion's bid also included a pledge by Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, said that made The Onion's proposal better for creditors and he named it the winning bid. He has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies claimed that the bid violated Lopez\u2019s rules for the auction by including multiple entities and lacking a valid dollar amount. Jones also alleged Murray improperly canceled an expected round of live bidding and only selected among the sealed bids that were submitted.",
      "Jones called the auction \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud\u201d on his show, which airs on the Infowars website, radio stations and Jones' X account.",
      "In a court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Lopez\u2019s September order on the auction procedures made a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "But at a Nov. 14 hearing Lopez said he was concerned about the process and transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "The assets of Infowars' parent company, Free Speech Systems, that were up for sale included the Austin studio, Infowars' video archive, video production equipment, product trademarks, and Infowars' websites and social media accounts.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights, but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "Jones has brought in millions of dollars a year in revenue by hawking nutritional supplements, clothing, survival gear and other merchandise \u2014 including more than $22 million this year through Sept. 30 from his Infowars Store website, according to court documents.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Documents filed in court earlier this year said Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, while Free Speech Systems had about $6 million in cash and more than $1 million worth of inventory."

      "Nightmares of Thanksgivings past have further shaped holiday traffic jams. Motorists who learned to avoid traveling the day before and the Sunday after Thanksgiving have created new bottlenecks on other days, according to Diaz.",
      "\u201cBecause we warned for so long (that) Wednesday and Sunday are the worst days to travel, people were like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to leave on Tuesday and come back on Monday to avoid the rush,\u2019\" she said. \u201cSo now those two days are congested as well.\u201d",
      "Airport security officials are pleading with passengers to arrive early, not to put lithium-ion batteries in checked bags in case they overheat, and to keep guns out of carry-on bags. TSA has discovered more than 6,000 guns at checkpoints this year, and most of them were loaded.",
      "Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas bring out many infrequent travelers, and they often have questions about what they can bring on the plane.",
      "TSA has a list on its website of items that are banned or restricted.",
      "Drivers should know that Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons will be the worst times to travel by car, but it should be smooth sailing on freeways come Thanksgiving Day, according to transportation analytics company INRIX.",
      "On the return home, the best travel times for motorists are before 1 p.m. on Sunday, and before 8 a.m. or after 7 p.m. on Monday, the company said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Northeast is experiencing an unusually severe and widespread drought during months that are typically the wettest",
      "DENVER -- It hasn't been a typical fall for the northeastern United States.",
      "Fires have burned in parks and forests around New York City. Towns and cities in a stretch from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to south of Philadelphia had their driest three months on record, according to the Applied Climate Information System. Some reservoirs in the region are near historic lows.",
      "Major changes need to happen to avoid critical shortages of water in the future, even if that future isn't immediate. As the climate warms, droughts will continue to intensify and communities should use this one as motivation to put in place long-term solutions, experts say.",
      "\u201cThis is the canary in the coal mine for the future,\u201d said Tim Eustance, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. \u201cPeople should stop watering their lawns yesterday.\u201d",
      "Eustance wants New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to issue a drought emergency to increase people\u2019s sense of urgency.",
      "Here are some ways to stretch water experts said could become necessary in the Northeast.",
      "One important place water is stored is under our feet. Groundwater has dropped significantly over the years in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York.",
      "Groundwater makes up about half of New Jersey's drinking water. Sprawl and concrete can make it tough for rain to replenish the water underground.",
      "\u201cNew Jersey is \u2018mall-landia.\u2019 We have these giant parking lots that could be ways to reclaim water instead of having runoff,\u201d Eustance said.",
      "In some other parts of the country there is increasing use of permeable asphalt, concrete and pavers that allow water to percolate into the ground and back into the aquifer. It would be up to municipalities to require that, he said.",
      "A faster way to replenish the aquifer is by injecting highly treated wastewater into it, something Los Angeles has been doing for years. It is dramatically adding to the city's available water.",
      "Virginia Beach, Virginia, is also pumping highly treated water back into its aquifer, and Anne Arundel County in Maryland is trying to pass legislation that would allow the same.",
      "In some places in the western U.S., getting paid to save water has long been an option. Some cities and counties pay dollars for every square foot of lawn torn out and replaced with native landscaping.",
      "Those policies are not nearly as widespread in the Northeast, said Alan Roberson, CEO of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators.",
      "\u201cThe abundance has created a different perspective,\u201d he said. This can make it hard to get people on board with conservation.",
      "Upgraded water meters can give customers details about their water use and help them see where they can save money when drought doesn't feel as urgent, said Beth O'Connell, chief engineer for Anne Arundel County, Maryland.",
      "The concept is simple: capture water from the sink, clothes washer, shower and toilet, treat it to a high standard and use it again for nonpotable purposes: It can be sent back through pipes to flush toilets, cool buildings, water yards or help raise water levels in a river or aquifer.",
      "\u201cOne of the crimes I think, in America, is we use drinking water to water our lawns and flush our toilet,\u201d Eustance said.",
      "Zach Gallagher is CEO of Natural Systems Utilities, which designs, builds and operates water recycling systems. He also is the father of three kids and lives in New Jersey, so this drought hits close to home.",
      "\u201cI feel like I'm doing something that is going to be meaningful and leave something beyond for my children, and their children,\u201d he said.",
      "Reuse can be a tool for both drought and flood, he explained. When a building can reuse its own wastewater and discharge it directly into a body of water, it eases stress on a city's fragile sewer system, which is a common vulnerability in old coastal cities. It also reduces demand on new water.",
      "Once open this summer, the company's redesign of the old Domino Sugar Refinery on New York\u2019s East River will be able to treat 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of wastewater a day, enough to cover a football field in nearly 15 inches (38 centimeters) of water. The cleaned water will be piped back into the new mixed-use buildings for flushing toilets, cooling and landscaping, with some of it discharged back into the river.",
      "Nonpotable reuse has a growing footprint in the eastern U.S., but scaling it to a regional level should be the next focus, O'Connell said.",
      "Planning for a future that includes extended drought can be costly. It could also require a shift in mindset from one of abundance to conservation, said Del Shannon, dam engineer and member of the American Society of Civil Engineers.",
      "He has worked on water projects around the world and said many developing countries are focused on getting reliable water for crops and drinking.",
      "\u201cWe need to treat our water and guard it as gently as those countries are.\"",

      "In her speech to the CBI's conference, Ms Newton-Smith argued that \"tax rises like this must never again simply be done to business\".",

      "\"When you hit profits, you hit competitiveness, you hit investment. You hit\u202fgrowth,\" she said.",
      "Stuart Paver, chair of Pavers Shoes, an outlet shop chain with more than 190 stores in the UK and Ireland, told the BBC the tax changes in the Budget would cost his business \u00a34.2m and would \"hinder expansion\".",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re opening about 10 to 15 stores a year at the moment, and that plan has been slowed down at the moment as we go through the uncertainty,\u201d he told the Today programme.",
      "Last week, a group of major retailers, including Tesco, Amazon and Next, wrote to the chancellor to warn her of the impact tax changes would have.",
      "Firms such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have said they will face a huge jump in costs and they may need to increase prices for customers.",
      "However, others have said that asking multimillion-pound companies to pay more in taxes was one of the fairer ways to improve funding for services like the NHS.",
      "\"No-one is questioning that we need to see the tax rises to really help fund our public services,\" Ms Newton-Smith told the Today programme.",
      "But she said that firms had been taken aback by the lowering of the threshold for the payment of National Insurance, and that the pain was \"really serious\".",
      "In her speech, she urged the government to consider a number of reforms to improve economic growth, such as giving companies more flexibility around how they spend money using the apprenticeship levy.",
      "She also said the chancellor should look at updating business rates for commercial property, as well as simplifying the planning system.",
      "According to reports on Monday, the chancellor will use an opportunity at the conference to respond to criticism of Labour's first Budget in 14 years.",
      "The Guardian suggests she will tell business leaders that they have offered \"no alternative\" to her plans, and that it was necessary to \"wipe the slate clean\" following the General Election.",
      "During the campaign period, Labour had promised that \"working people\" would not see higher taxes in their payslips.",
      "A government spokesperson said the pledge meant that it had had to take \"difficult choices to repair the public finances and to put public finances on a firmer footing\".",
      "\"Despite the difficult inheritance, the government is determined to go for growth and to work in partnership with businesses to invest in Britain's future so we can make every part of the country better off,\" they added."

    "summary": "Bills for leaseholders have risen by 44% since 2016. Is Labour's new plan really the solution?",
    "story": [
      "In 2016, Michele McInroy was overjoyed to pick up the keys to her new home - a two-bedroom flat in a refurbished building in Woolwich, south London. But her joy soon soured.",
      "Communal areas were neglected, lifts didn\u2019t work and repairs went unfixed, Michele says. Earlier this year, her service charge increased to around \u00a310,000 a year, marking a 320% rise in five years.",
      "Michele, who works as a civil servant, hopes to move from the capital to Dundee to be closer to her grandson but she is struggling to sell the flat - and believes that the service charge is making it harder still. \u201cI'm losing time that I could be spending with my family that's really precious to me,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI just feel trapped and there is absolutely nothing I can do.\u201d",
      "Across England and Wales, other homeowners are telling similar stories, as annual service charges have risen significantly. The average is currently \u00a32,321, up 44% since 2016, according to estate agent Hamptons. In London it\u2019s \u00a32,500, marking a 52% increase in the same period.",
      "Others I have spoken to say their service charges have increased by 400-500% in that time.",
      "Among them is Gaz Rahman, whose annual service charge for his flat in the London borough of Tower Hamlets hit \u00a34,654 in 2024, up from \u00a3960 five years earlier. \u201cThere's no accountability,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt just doesn't add up.\u201d",
      "Sue Robertson, who owns a one-bedroom flat in West Sussex, reports that her service charge has shot up by 320% since 2019 - from \u00a3750 to \u00a33,198 a year.",
      "Some leaseholders have opened up about the devastating effect of these costs on their lives - among them are cases of bankruptcy, pressure on relationships and mental health. Sue Robertson tells me that she was hospitalised after attempting suicide. The financial pressure was, she says, a major factor. \u201cEverything just got too much for me.\u201d",
      "For years, politicians have said they planned to address this issue. Then, last week, the current government committed to abolishing leasehold. Housing minister Matthew Pennycook said in a statement that there will be a consultation and white paper early next year - but for some this has come too late.",
      "And the question that remains is, how did it reach a point where the government needed to intervene?",
      "Part of the problem is that this is an archaic system, based on principles dating back to the feudal days of landowners and tenants. Under the current system, leaseholders have to pay charges to a freeholder for services, including the maintenance and repair of communal areas and buildings insurance. Often a managing agent is appointed by the freeholder.",
      "The vague language in the current law adds to the confusion. The law simply states that service charges must be \u201creasonable\u201d and that where costs relate to work or services, they must be of a \u201creasonable\u201d standard.",
      "But campaigners in the field argue that there is another issue at play. They claim unscrupulous freeholders and managing agents are exploiting the system.",

      "As Sebastian O\u2019Kelly, chief executive of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, puts it: investors cottoned on to the fact they could make money out of the boom in newbuild apartment blocks that have sprung up across the country over the last 25 years.",
      "Previously most freeholders were local authorities or landowners but the boom has led to investors - including venture capital, pension funds and even charities - getting involved. Income from ground rents and lease extensions as well as the rising value of the land itself all make this lucrative.",
      "\u201cWe're talking about a multi-billion pound property sector.\u201d He argues that leaseholders are at the mercy of companies who are \u201cjust there to make money out of them\u201d.",
      "In a recent investigation, the BBC examined about 140 tribunals relating to one London-based firm, Assethold, and discovered that judges have assessed it to have overcharged homeowners by a combined sum of nearly \u00a31.2m. Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",
      "But the BBC has seen complaints about other companies accused of overcharging leaseholders too. The problem with policing this is that anyone can buy a freehold and anyone can set themselves up as a managing agent.",
      "\u201cThere are still thousands of people being exploited,\u201d says Sir Peter Bottomley, former Father of the House of Commons and a campaigner against the leasehold system. \u201cThe stories that have come to me in my last 15, 20 years in Parliament would make most people weep.\u201d He says that these include numerous stories of leaseholders being exploited by freeholders.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been happening in broad daylight.\u201d",
      "He also argues that it is \u201coften the young and less well-off who are being lumbered with costs they cannot afford, in ways which are unjustified\u201d.",
      "The Residential Freehold Association (RFA), which represents the largest freeholders in the country, strongly disagrees that the system is \u201cexploitative\u201d, but says it has \u201ccalled for improvements to the home buying and selling process\u201d so that leaseholders understand their obligations.",
      "Questions around transparency",
      "Large newbuild estates and buildings can be complex and expensive to maintain, but a concern among some is the lack of transparency. Leaseholders have complained about hefty bills with little detail or unexplained demands for eye-wateringly high sums.",
      "The Leasehold Advisory Service says that of the 33,000 people have gone to them for advice in the past five years, it has received more complaints about service charges than any other subject.",
      "However, industry insiders argue that there are legitimate reasons for rising charges, including the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the fallout from Brexit.",
      "\u201cWe have seen significant inflation in recent years, as well as extensive material cost increases following the Covid pandemic. This ultimately translates into higher service charges,\u201d the RFA said in a statement.",
      "Jaclyn Mangaroo of the Property Institute, a professional body that represents managing agents in England and Wales, is among those arguing that Brexit triggered an increase in costs. Some say exiting the EU has led to labour shortages in the industry.",
      "Mrs Mangaroo also points out that the Grenfell fire tragedy has seen insurance charges rise, which in turn pushed up service charges.",
      "However her organisation wants managing agents to be regulated to prevent what she calls \u201cabuse\u201d of the system. Its members are properly trained, she stresses, \u201cbut there is no oversight or accountability for those outside the membership, for everybody else that's operating\u201d.",
      "Last week the housing minister has announced they would regulate managing agents but added they need to consult on this first.",
      "Labour's new plans",
      "Abolishing leasehold for flats was not included in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024. Ultimately, the Conservative government ran out of time to get everything it wanted into the legislation before Rishi Sunak called the general election.",
      "The legislation that passed did include some gains for leaseholders, such as giving them more power to buy their freehold. Now, however, certain elements of the previous government\u2019s plans that never made into law will be taken forward by Labour, including making it easier for residents to acquire \u201cthe right to manage\u201d. (In other words, they will still have a freeholder but can take over the management of their building.)",
      "However, the RFA says its studies show that \u201cself-management looks to make no difference\u201d to service charge costs.",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "After Scotland abolished leasehold two decades ago, it introduced the commonhold system where residents own the building and a factor (a type of property agent) maintains the common areas of buildings on their behalf. Unlike managing agents in England, factors must be registered.",
      "Commonhold has been an option in England and Wales since it was introduced under Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2002, but the tenure has not caught on - it applies in only 1% of properties in England and Wales.",
      "Then, last week, Pennycook announced that commonhold would be made \"the default tenure,\" as part of the wider plan to abolish leasehold, but this will all take time to get right. The prime minister reiterated this in a radio interview.",
      "Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), believes that commonhold is the right way forward. \u201c[It means] the flat owners all have a vested interest in getting best value for money on service charges.\u201d",
      "But the RFA warns that commonhold isn\u2019t a \u201csilver bullet\u201d. Sometimes, not all residents in a building agree to work going ahead, which can slow down repairs or prevent them happening at all, they say.",
      "Fightback from landowners",
      "Whatever happens next, it won\u2019t be easy. Landowners have power and deep pockets and they\u2019re prepared to fight for the land. A group of major freeholders are bringing a legal challenge under the Human Rights Act over proposed changes to the calculation used to compensate landowners when leases are extended.",
      "Henry Hill of the ConservativeHome website is sceptical that any government will ever be able to successfully take on all those with a vested interest in preserving leasehold. \u201cWe're talking tens of billions, hundreds of billions maybe worth of value, unless the government was prepared to try and just take that without compensation, which in our current legal regime would be impossible,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cFormally abolishing leasehold is not going to happen.\u201c",
      "However, Sebastian O\u2019Kelly is hopeful. \u201cLabour needs to get it finished,\u201d he says.",
      "Labour has said it will indeed get it finished and it is \u201cswitching on\u201d some of the legislation that the Conservatives bought in. In addition, they are drafting another bill that will go further.",
      "In the meantime, however, frustration is still growing among many leaseholders, as this all requires more waiting.",
      "And according to Suzanne Muna from the Social Housing Action Campaign (SHAC), \u201cpeople are getting organised\u201d, with members going on service charge strike and refusing to pay soaring bills. It is a risky move, as under lease conditions, it can leave leaseholders at risk of losing their home.",
      "Some, however, have successfully challenged their service charges. Property lawyer Keeley Livingstone, from Essex, says she was able to save \u00a3140,000 for her and her neighbours, after spending more than 100 hours examining their bills and pointing to the freeholder where they had been overcharged.",
      "\u201cThere were a few things on there that just didn't look right,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have a concierge and security. I questioned that because [the bill] was so high, and we don't see half of these people. That was removed - \u00a398,000 worth.\u201d",
      "But others, like Michele, still feel stuck. \u201cI have absolutely no power,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to sell my flat and I cannot.\u201d",
      "She says that Pennycook, who is her local MP, seemed sympathetic to her situation when she and her neighbours raised it with him. Whether he can change their particular situation - and that of thousands of others - remains to be seen.",
      "\u201cI would never buy a leasehold again,\u201d says Michele. \u201cLandlords have too much power. The management company has too much power. It should be equal, and it's not.\u201d",

    "summary": "Scientists in the Caribbean are turning algae that have been choking beaches into biofuel.",
    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",

      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",
      "UWI hopes to introduce other sargassum-based innovations too, such as pest control products.",
      "Ms Spencer says it\u2019s been \"heart-warming\u201d to witness the results of the team\u2019s research.",
      "\u201cJust seeing the actual potential is motivating me to keep working,\u201d she adds.",
      "As for Brittney, five years after her eureka moment, she says she\u2019s still \u201cpinching\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cTo see the car in action was mind-blowing,\u201d she grins. \u201cI would encourage all young scientists to press ahead with their ideas. You never know when you might make the next big discovery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of work, plenty of grit and pushing against walls to reach this point,\u201d Dr Henry concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of UWI innovation and is exportable to the wider world, because it\u2019s not just the Caribbean that\u2019s affected; sargassum also impacts parts of West Africa, South America and Florida.",

    "summary": "The iconic carmaker's rebrand has certainly caught people's attention, but will it pay off?",
    "story": [
      "Jaguar has urged people to \"trust and reserve judgement\" over the rebrand of the carmaker.",
      "The company, embarking on the biggest change in its 102-year old history, released a new logo and a so-called \"social media tease\" this week, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in early December.",
      "The teaser video has faced backlash, with many critics pointing to the fact it doesn't feature an actual car. Others have praised the company for being bold and shaking things up.",
      "Either way, the rebrand has grabbed people's attention and Jaguar has since admitted it not only expected such debate - but it wanted it.",
      "In the 1960s, Jaguar launched the E-Type and XJ which have come to be known among some of the most iconic cars of all time.",
      "Now the company is trying to do the same again by unveiling its new \"design vision\" in Miami next month.",
      "Teasing the vision online, the 30 second advert features models in extravagant, brightly-coloured outfits who reveal the new company logo written as JaGUar.",
      "No cars, no suave men in suits, no big cats.",
      "\"Do you sell cars?\" was the response on X, from owner Elon Musk, who is also the boss of electric car firm Tesla.",
      "\"This is surely a joke?\" added one user, while another suggested the move would \"cost jobs and do real damage\". Some said \"Go woke, go broke\".",
      "Specsavers, known for its humorous social media manner, created a mock-up of its own logo in response, which looked like it had been created on Microsoft Paint.",
      "While supermarket Aldi chipped in at Jaguar's \"Copy Nothing\" slogan with: \"You sound like our legal team.\"",
      "Amid the anger and sarcasm, Jaguar has doubled down on its decision, replying to some posts with phrases such as \"To live is to evolve\".",
      "\"We had to break rules and do something that would get us cut thru,\" a spokesman told the BBC - suggesting this is all part of the plan.",
      "As Martin Brundle, the former Formula 1 racing driver turned broadcaster, put it:  \"I have no idea what this is all about, but it\u2019s genius.",
      "\"Everyone is talking about Jaguar in a moment of time when they\u2019re not actually making cars.\"",
      "'Maybe Jaguar wanted this response'",
      "Lee Rolston is the chief growth officer of global branding agency Jones Knowles Ritchie and has worked on rebrands of household names such as Burger King and the RSPCA.",
      "He was also part of the thinking to famously drop the donuts from Dunkin' to move \"to a first-name basis with America\", given it was also one of the country's the biggest coffee sellers.",
      "He says rebrands occur generally when a company wants to \"shift\" its business strategy, which is what Jaguar is doing in its move to electric-only cars.",
      "In an \"ideal world\" the rebrand leads to buzz and a positive reaction, Mr Rolston adds, but to achieve that you need to \"make sure people understand the context\".",
      "\"Don\u2019t ever just launch a logo - when people see a logo they tend to subjectively respond to it. It\u2019s always good to show as much as you can,\" he explains.",
      "\"Unless you want that response. Maybe Jaguar did actually want this kind of response\" Mr Rolston ponders.",
      "As a result of Jaguar's rebrand strategy to tease and drip feed information of its plans, a void has been created, and that has been \"filled by opinion\", Mr Rolston says.",
      "\u201cThey have taken a very brave route - it\u2019s one that very, very few brands ever do take because it\u2019s very risky, but time will tell.\"",
      "It's not new to not include a product in an ad or to raise eyebrows - the gorilla beating the drums to Phil Collins didn't feature any Cadbury's chocolate, for example.",
      "Keith Wells, founder and director of brand strategy business Brandwell, points out Apple's \"think different\" advert in 1997 which, rather than showcasing its computers, instead featured the likes of Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.",
      "However, Mr Wells has first-hand experience of a rebrand backlash. Remember Consignia? (Readers under the age of 40 can be forgiven for not).",
      "In 2001, he led the consultancy Dragon Brands, which came up with the new  corporate name for the Post Office Group. The aim was to create a new, modern umbrella brand for the restructured organisation, which included not just the Post Office, but Royal Mail and Parcelforce too.",
      "But the creation of Consignia led to a backlash from the public, largely due to people misinterpreting the rebrand.",
      "Some people thought Post Office branches would be renamed Consignia, which wasn't the case.",
      "Nonetheless, the negativity, and a new leadership team, eventually led to Consignia being canned, and being renamed Royal Mail plc 16 months later.",
      "While Jaguar isn't changing its name, Mr Wells says the brand has taken a \"huge, bold step\" and people should give \"respect and time\" to see how things pan out.",
      "Mr Rolston said \"branding logic\" suggests companies \"lean into\" their current perception with the public, but Jaguar appears to have shunned that.",
      "\"Everything they have put out so far is not like a Jaguar. The question is, if it\u2019s not a Jaguar as you used to know it, what is it?\"",
      "Jaguar argues its rebrand can been traced back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons, that \"A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing\".",
      "'Something has to change'",
      "But it's clear, as Erin Baker, editorial director at AutoTrader puts it, that the carmaker is trying to ditch the \"sage\" image, that its cars are only for older, white men, who perhaps frequent golf clubs, or wear cravats and smoke cigars.",
      "\"It\u2019s been languishing in terms of sales for years now,\" she said. \"Something has to change fundamentally with the brand.\"",
      "But Ms Baker is a fan of the rebrand ad. \"I think it needs to really stir emotion, it needs to stir curiosity, get people asking questions,\" she says.",
      "Jaguar has been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group owned by Tata Motors for almost a decade, with The Range Rover and Defender behind the company's highest profits.",
      "Ms Baker believes Jaguar's radical rebrand is a final attempt to revive it. But what happens if it doesn't pay off?",
      "\"I am not sure what else they can do,\" adds Ms Baker. \"It\u2019s a very risky move to go pure electric in 2026 when sales of electric cars the world over have largely stalled amongst private buyers.",
      "\"But the truth is...no one has an idea if this is going to succeed or not.\"",

      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",
      "Some customers could immediately save \u00a3100 a year by moving from paying their bill every three months to paying by direct debit.",
      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "The charity National Energy Action said many people were already \"rationing their energy use\" or building up debt to try to keep warm.",

      "As a carer for her mum, she told the BBC she was having to make tough choices.",
      "\"I\u2019m over \u00a31,000 in arrears with [my energy supplier] so I don\u2019t put the gas and electric on,\" she said. \"We just sit there with our onesies on of a night. I think it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s a disgrace.\"",
      "Close to where she was speaking is Kitty's Laundrette, a co-operative which provides cheap washing and drying for the community, as well as a free service for those who need it.",
      "Anthony Scott is part of the team running it, seeing dozens of customers every day, many of whom are struggling financially.",
      "\u201cI come across a lot of anger, I feel a lot of anger. People are being priced out of using energy in their own home,\" he said.",
      "Winter fuel payment debate",
      "The cap affects those on default, variable tariffs, not those who have fixed a price for a set period.",
      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called on the government to reinstate winter fuel payments to all pensioners and \"cancel the bill rise\".",

    "story": [
      "Spain has fined five budget airlines a total of \u20ac179m (\u00a3149m) for \"abusive practices\" including charging for hand luggage.",
      "Ryanair has been given the largest fine of \u20ac108m (\u00a390m), followed by EasyJet's penalty of \u20ac29m (\u00a324m).",
      "Vueling, Norwegian and Volotea were issued with sanctions by Spain's Consumer Rights Ministry on Friday.",
      "The ministry said it plans to ban practices such as charging extra for carry-on hand luggage and reserving seats for children.",
      "The fines are the biggest sanction issued by the ministry, and follow an investigation into the budget airline industry.",
      "The ministry said it had upheld fines that were first announced in May after dismissing appeals lodged by the companies.",
      "Vueling, the budget arm of British Airways owner IAG, has been fined \u20ac39m (\u00a332m), while Norwegian Airlines and Volotea have been fined \u20ac1.6m (\u00a31.3m) and \u20ac1.2m (\u00a31m) respectively.",
      "The fines were issued because the airlines were found to have provided misleading information and were not transparent with prices, \"which hinders consumers' ability to compare offers\" and make informed decisions, the ministry said.",
      "Ryanair was accused of violating a range of consumer rights, including charging for larger carry-on luggage, seat selection, and asking for \"a disproportionate amount\" to print boarding passes at terminals.",
      "Each fine was calculated based on the \"illicit profit\" obtained by each airline from these practices.",
      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the fines were \"illegal\" and \"baseless\", adding that he will appeal the case and take it to the EU courts.",
      "\"Ryanair has for many years used bag fees and airport check-in fees to change passenger behaviour and we pass on these cost savings in the form of lower fares to consumers,\" he said.",
      "Easyjet and Norwegian said they would also appeal the decision.",
      "The Spanish airline industry association, ALA, plans a further appeal and has called the ministry's decision \"nonsense\", arguing the fine infringes EU free market rules.",
      "But Andr\u00e9s Barrag\u00e1n, secretary general for consumer affairs and gambling at the ministry, defended the fines, saying the government's decision was based on Spanish and EU law.",
      "\"It is an abuse to charge \u20ac20 for just printing the boarding card in the airport, [it's] something no one wants,\" he told the BBC's World Business Report programme.",

      "The sisters had always been interested in beauty products and chats with professionals backstage led to a \"lightbulb moment\".",
      "They decided to create a collection of brightly coloured, distinctive make-up brushes at a lower price point, made from synthetic fibres.",
      "\"We wanted to create products that had a bit more personality than the ones you would see behind the scenes,\" she said.",
      "\"We were trying to create a professional product but aimed at a more mass market,\" Sophie said.",
      "\"We knew that we ourselves would never go into a shop and spend \u00a340-plus on a single make-up brush. But we would actually buy a set of brushes for that price,\" she said.",
      "To achieve a cheaper price, synthetic fibres were key, while the density of the hair helps to achieve a high quality finish.",
      "Traditional brushes are made with animal hair from squirrels, goats or sable, a species of weasel.",
      "Although synthetic bristles had been around for decades, Sophie says many industry professionals used animal hair brushes when the sisters launched the brand.",

      "Much of the company's marketing is done through social media: Spectrum gives brushes to make-up artists and influencers who will tag the brand.",
      "Marketing the brushes as vegan and cruelty-free also tapped into a wider trend in the fashion industry to move away from animal-derived textiles such as leather and fur and many professional make-up artists also became fans of Spectrum's brushes.",
      "The firm's suppliers are in China and the company conducts audits every six months, Sophie said, checking that workers were treated correctly and that the environment the brushes are made in complied with regulations.",
      "Deals and expansion",
      "Sophie and Hannah created \"personality-led collections\" - vibrant colours and designs as well as more minimalist options - mixing beauty and fashion.",
      "In 2018, Spectrum agreed a deal with Disney for a Little Mermaid collection inspired by mermaid princess Ariel. It included brushes with pastel-toned bristles and and turquoise bags with metallic fin closures and pearl studs.",
      "The company also produced a Frozen bundle of brushes in icy, shimmery whites, with sponges shaped like the snowman Olaf.",
      "Spectrum has moved away from licensing deals more recently, however, and wants to focus more on its own ranges.",

      "Currently, 60% of Spectrum's business is in the UK, 30% in the United States and 10% in Canada and other parts of the world.",
      "The sisters now want to further expand the company across the globe.",

    "summary": "Farmers have dominated the debate over changes to inheritance tax \u2013 but the issue is much wider than that.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers have dominated the debate over the recent Budget's change to inheritance tax \u2013 but the issue is much wider than that. Family businesses are affected in the same ways, and there are many more of them.",
      "As the implications dawn on many such families, there are warnings of lower investment, lower employment, lower growth and the potential takeover of a vital part of the economy by big, and often foreign, corporates.",
      "The change comes from the chancellor's decision to tax assets as they pass from one generation to another.",
      "For most people, that tax kicks in for assets worth more than \u00a3325,000, or \u00a3500,000 if the family home is being passed on.",
      "But for farmers and businesses, passing on assets from one generation to the next is currently tax free - and that tax relief has been unlimited.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to exempt the first \u00a31m of agricultural or business property. After that, it will be taxed at 20% - half the rate of inheritance tax required from others.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "It's not clear how many farmers that would affect. The Treasury estimates 500 per year; the National Farmers Union says it's closer to 70,000 in total.",
      "At least part of the wide difference may be explained by farmers also claiming Business Property Relief where their assets are in non-agricultural activity, such as holiday lets, a farm shop or a mail order company.",
      "The number of non-farm businesses affected by this is harder to gauge, but one rough estimate is that it could be about 20 times more.",
      "Scotland doesn't have as many middling-sized family businesses as other economies.",
      "But in some sectors, they play an important role - notably food processing.  Well-known brands such as Tunnock's, Baxter's of Fochabers and Walker's Shortbread are some of the larger ones.",
      "One of the reasons you may not have heard such a backlash against the new tax on inherited wealth is because it's just that - inherited wealth. These families don't get much sympathy for their tax breaks... or at least, not as much as farmers.",
      "The Grant family, distillers of Glenfiddich whisky, is reckoned by Forbes magazine to be worth about \u00a32.9bn. Inheritance tax on transferring that wealth is currently nil.  In future, it could be \u00a3580m.",
      "Some sectors are warning there could be unintended consequences from forcing families, in some cases, to turn a fifth of their assets into the cash necessary to pay HMRC.",
      "As with farmers, many of these businesses are capital intensive, while not generating big incomes.",
      "One of the sectors affected is plant hire and operation - the trucks, diggers and numerous other pieces of equipment that are required by construction and other sectors, including farming.",
      "Family firms account for 85% of the Scottish Plant Operators Association's 350 members. Plant hire has been largely unaffected by consolidation into larger firms.",
      "Requiring large, expensive capital assets, it is hard hit by a tax which targets the value of assets rather than their profitability. The new tax regime will not take into account the ability of firms to raise cash to pay.",
      "Former SPOA president Mark Anderson is managing director of GAP, the fourth largest plant hire operator in Britain.",
      "Based in Glasgow, it is now owned by the third generation of the family.  Mark's father and uncle are past retirement age, but still work within the business.",
      "The firm has 2,200 workers on the payroll. The most recent annual turnover reached \u00a3340m.",
      "Mark says that businesses like his can be loyal to workers and take long-term decisions, riding through the peaks and troughs of the business cycle.  Several of those on the staff have 40 years' experience, while two have more than 50.",
      "If the company were on the stock market or owned by a private equity fund, it would be under pressure for short-term results.",
      "\"Some of our assets take 10 years to deliver a return. These are assets that private equity won't go into because they don't get a return after a year,\" he says.",
      "Mark enjoys his job and likes the people that he works with.",
      "\"I have two daughters, and I wonder if, in the future, this is something my girls would want to go into.\"",
      "Handing over to his daughters is a long way off as they're only aged five and 10.",
      "But following the Budget three weeks ago, planning for succession has become a major source of uncertainty and future cost for businesses like GAP.",
      "There are ways of avoiding the tax, using existing loopholes. The main way is to gift assets to the next generation, on condition that you live for seven years after the transfer.",
      "Businesses seeking to limit their exposure to tax face making macabre judgements on the life expectancy of older members - or insuring against the death of younger ones, who could defy tax planning if they die young.",
      "In many cases, like with the Grant family of distillers, the wealth is split across siblings and cousins. As assets pass to the next generation, there may be a slightly lower tax bill because of the \u00a31m exemption per person.",
      "But the need to raise cash could force some family members to sell a share, and a lot of that could destabilise the firm.",
      "Ryan Scatterty is managing director of Thistle Seafoods near Peterhead, and is the fifth generation at the firm. It also has a processing unit in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, employs 800 people and has a \u00a3133m turnover.",
      "He says the seafood sector is dominated by family firms who are in a similar position to the farmers in the north east of Scotland who are protesting about the inheritance tax proposals.",
      "He says beneficiaries are unlikely to have the cash needed to pay HMRC, even with 10 years of installments.",
      "\"The only way to come up with that is to sell the business.  That could be to a large multinational, which could be foreign-owned, and without that commitment to the local community,\" he says.",
      "\"The question for the government is: do they want these sectors to be owned by giant multinationals?\"",
      "He also says the inheritance tax change is a disincentive to invest. If an investment was to increase a family firm's value by \u00a310m, he believes that the 20% tax bill at the point of death may no longer make it look financially viable.",
      "Paul Andrews, founder of Family Business United, says its members were shocked by the Budget.",
      "\"It's caused a lot of conversations around succession. The unintended consequences will be reduced investment,\" he says.",
      "Another membership organisation, Family Business UK, says it has been \"inundated\" by inquiries about membership and advice.",
      "The Treasury says Rachel Reeves made the choice to raise tax both to stabilise public finances and improve public services, and that her tax choices were to put an additional burden on businesses and those with wealth.",
      "Where tax revenue is required, it's easier to raise it from relatively wealthy people who have died than from income or consumer taxes on those with modest incomes.",
      "Chris Campbell - a tax specialist at Icas, the institute of chartered accountants in Scotland - says its members have been busy this month with approaches for advice.",
      "Businesses are hoping that the pressure beign applied by farmers could lead to a change of policy.",

      "Just weeks ago, Gautam Adani, one of the world\u2019s richest men, celebrated Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and announced plans to invest $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) in energy and infrastructure projects in the US.",
      "Now, the 62-year-old Indian billionaire and a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose sprawling $169bn empire spans ports and renewable energy, faces US fraud charges that could potentially jeopardise his ambitions at home and abroad.",
      "Federal prosecutors have accused him of orchestrating a $250m bribery scheme and concealing it to raise money in the US. They allege Mr Adani and his executives paid bribes to Indian officials to secure contracts worth $2bn in profits over 20 years. Adani Group has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\"",
      "But this is already hurting the group and the Indian economy.",
      "Adani Group firms lost $34bn in market value on Thursday, reducing the combined market capitalisation of its 10 companies to $147bn. Adani Green Energy, which is the firm at the centre of the allegations, also said it wouldn't proceed with a $600m bond offering.",
      "Then there are questions about the impact of the charges on India\u2019s business and politics.",
      "India\u2019s economy is deeply intertwined with Mr Adani, the country\u2019s leading  infrastructure tycoon. He operates 13 ports (30% market share),  seven airports (23% of passenger traffic), and India\u2019s second-largest cement business (20% of the market).",
      "With six coal-fired power plants, Mr Adani is India's largest private player in power. At the same time, he has pledged to invest $50bn in green hydrogen and runs a 8,000km (4,970 miles)-long natural gas pipeline. He\u2019s also building India's longest expressway and redeveloping India\u2019s largest slum. He employs over 45,000 people, but his businesses impact millions nationwide.",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "Gautam Adani: Asia's richest man",
      "His global ambitions span coal mines in Indonesia and Australia, and infrastructure projects in Africa.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s portfolio closely mirrors Modi\u2019s policy priorities, beginning with infrastructure and more recently expanding into clean energy. He has thrived despite critics labeling his business empire as crony capitalism, pointing to his close ties with Modi, both as Gujarat's chief minister - where they both hail from - and as India's prime minister. (Like any successful businessman, Mr Adani has also forged ties with many opposition leaders, investing in their states.)",
      "\u201cThis [the bribery allegations] is big. Mr Adani and Modi have been inseparable for a long time. This is going to influence the political economy of India,\u201d says Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, an Indian journalist who has written extensively on the business group.",
      "This crisis also comes as Mr Adani has spent nearly two years trying to rebuild his image after US short-seller Hindenburg Research's 2023 report accused his conglomerate of decades of stock manipulation and fraud. Though Mr Adani denied the claims, the allegations triggered a market sell-off and an ongoing investigation by India's market regulator, SEBI.",
      "\u201cMr Adani has been trying to rehabilitate his image, and try to show that those earlier fraud allegations leveled by the Hindenburg group were not true, and his company and his businesses had actually been doing quite well. There'd been a number of new deals and investments made over the last year or so, and so this is just a body blow coming to this billionaire who had done a very good job of shaking off the potential damage of those earlier allegations,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.",
      "For now, raising capital at home may prove challenging for Mr Adani's cash-guzzling projects.",
      "\"The market reaction shows how serious this is,\" Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told the BBC. \"Adanis will still secure funding for their major projects, but with delays.\"",
      "The latest charges could also throw a spanner in Mr Adani\u2019s global expansion plans. He has been already challenged in Kenya and Bangladesh over a planned takeover of an international airport and a controversial energy deal.  \"This [bribery charges] stops international expansion plans linked to the US,\" Nirmalya Kumar, Lee Kong Chian Professor at Singapore Management University, told the BBC.",
      "What\u2019s next? Politically, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has unsurprisingly called for Mr Adani\u2019s arrest and promised to stir up parliament. \u201cBribing government officials in India is not news, but the amounts mentioned are staggering. I suspect the US has names of some of those who were the intended recipients. This has potential reverberations for the Indian political scene. There is more to come,\u201d Mr Kumar believes.",
      "Mr Adani\u2019s team will undoubtedly assemble a top-tier legal defence. \"For now, we have only the indictment, leaving much still to unfold,\" says Mr Kugelman.",
      "While the US-India business relationship may face scrutiny, it\u2019s unlikely to be significantly impacted, particularly given the recent $500m US deal with Mr Adani for a port project in Sri Lanka, says Mr Kugelman. Despite the serious allegations, broader US-India business ties remain strong.",
      "\u201cThe US-India business relationship is a very large and multifaceted one. Even with these very serious allegations against someone that's such a major player in the Indian economy, I don't think we should overstate the impact that this could have on that relationship,\u201d Mr Kugelman says.",
      "Also, it's unclear if Mr Adani can be targeted, despite the US-India extradition treaty, as it depends on whether the new administration allows the cases to proceed. Mr Baliga believes it is not doom and gloom for the Adanis. \"I still do think foreign investors and banks will back them like they did post Hindenburg though, given that they are part of very important, well performing sectors of the Indian economy,\" he says.",
      "\"The sense in the market is also that this will perhaps blow over and be sorted out, once the [Donald] Trump administration takes over.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Homeowners have told the BBC how they have been left thousands of pounds a year worse off because of charges imposed by a company that owns hundreds of freeholds across England and Wales.",
      "A BBC News investigation has found that leaseholders have had to pay hundreds of pounds for services such as key-cutting and the cleaning of doormats and council bins.",
      "We have examined about 140 court tribunals relating to the company, Assethold, and discovered that judges have assessed it to have overcharged homeowners by a combined sum of nearly \u00a31.2m.",
      "Leaseholders have spoken to the BBC about the impact on their mental health of the sharp rise in fees they have faced and of their fight to hold the freeholder to account.",
      "On Thursday, ahead of the publication of this investigation, the government announced the leasehold system in England and Wales would be overhauled by the end of the current Parliament.",
      "'I dread the post'",
      "In the spring I received an email from Sue Robertson, following an investigation I carried out into the overcharging of leaseholders. The email was among about 200 I was sent by homeowners who told me they were having issues with their service charges.",
      "Sue described how soaring charges and legal threats were affecting her finances and health. I replied and a few days later heard from her neighbour, who told me Sue was in hospital having tried to take her own life. After she had recovered, I went to meet her.",
      "At Sue's one-bedroom ground-floor flat in Worthing, West Sussex, she explained to me that it had once been her \"sanctuary\"  but was now causing her severe anxiety.",
      "In 2019, she was paying about \u00a3750 a year in service charges. Sue thought the fee was about right for her flat, which is one of two in a small converted house and has little shared space to maintain.",
      "But that year, the freehold to her property was sold at auction to a north London firm called Assethold. She says its sister company, Eagerstates, took over the management, after which her service charge more than doubled. By 2023, her bill was \u00a33,198 - an increase of 320% in four years.",
      "\"I dread the post,\" she told me.",
      "\u201cEvery time we get a new bill, it's got something different on it. I think they're just charging us money for nothing.\"",
      "There are nearly five million leasehold properties in England - homes where residents pay ground rent on top of their mortgage.",
      "New laws are going through Parliament to force building owners to make the bills they charge more transparent, although campaigners who say the system is being abused don't believe the legislation goes far enough.",
      "The Leasehold Trap",
      "The True Cost of Leasehold",
      "The feudal hangover that accounts for a fifth of homes",
      "According to the Land Registry, Assethold owns the freehold to almost 400 sites in England and Wales, on properties ranging from small converted houses to large flat blocks.",
      "More than 10 people have spoken to me about consistent overcharging by Assethold and Eagerstates.",
      "They all allege that Assethold, owned by Joseph Gurvits, repeatedly overcharged leaseholders for shoddy or non-existent work commissioned by the managing agent, Eagerstates, which is also owned by Mr Gurvits and run by his son, Ronni.",
      "Through analysis of about 140 official court documents from the past five years, the BBC has discovered that Assethold, through Eagerstates, has overcharged leaseholders by at least \u00a31,173,000. Despite this, and multiple complaints to the authorities, the leaseholders we've spoken to say nobody is listening.",
      "'Unbearably stressful'",
      "Sue\u2019s neighbour, James, 31, who lives in the flat upstairs, is also struggling to pay the service charge. When he saw an increased bill, he says he flew into \"absolute panic - my heart was racing and I just didn't know what to do. I thought: 'We can't live here any more.'\u201d",
      "Assethold said: \"We are deeply concerned to hear that residents have reported emotional and financial stress due to these matters.\"",
      "Sue and James argue their bills are \"massively\" inflated and contain oddities such as a charge of \u00a3719 to get a key cut, as well as an annual fee of \u00a3500 to clean a 140x125cm (55x49in) doormat area and \u00a3300 to clean council wheelie bins - both of which Sue and James say have never been done.",
      "James says the situation has become \u201cunbearably stressful\u201d for him and his partner. He says he\u2019s working extra hours and has had to borrow \u00a330,000 to pay the increased charges and to hire solicitors.",
      "Assethold said: \"The increase in service charges over the past three years reflects essential infrastructure upgrades and inflationary pressures in the property sector.\"",
      "\u00a3135 to change two light bulbs",
      "One of the only ways leaseholders can challenge service charges is by going to a first-tier tribunal, a type of civil court.",
      "It is a tribunal\u2019s purpose to determine whether service charges are \u201creasonable and payable\u201d, and not to rule on whether there was any wrongdoing. But by examining hundreds of pages of evidence, we have found several judges' comments that indicate a pattern of bad practice relating to Assethold.",
      "At the lower end of the scale, one judge agreed that \u201c\u00a3135 to change two light bulbs was excessive\". At the other end, we have found that tribunals have awarded sums of up to \u00a3100,000 back to leaseholders for \"unreasonable\" service charges.",
      "One tribunal heard how homeowners had been unable to sell their flats and had been \u201csignificantly affected (financially and psychologically)\u201d.  In this case, about \u00a338,000 of the combined service charge was deemed to be unreasonable.",
      "Assethold was described in court as a \u201cmultimillion-pound freehold company\u201d that had \u201csimply refused to co-operate\u201d with the process, behaviour that was referenced in many of the documents we examined from about 140 court tribunals.",
      "Sebastian O'Kelly, director of registered charity and campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, says his organisation receives a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d number of complaints about Eagerstates.",
      "\u201cSomething is badly wrong with the way it manages its portfolio of properties. We are inundated with complaints about Eagerstates.\u201d",
      "In one case typical of those the BBC investigated, a judge called the firm's tactics \u201cmalicious\u201d, referred to \u201caggressive letters\u201d it had sent and repeatedly commented on the company\u2019s poor management.",
      "Assethold said it was \"actively reviewing findings from past tribunal decisions\" and had implemented changes where necessary.",
      "\"Across various properties we have always tried to ensure value for money across repairs as well as ensuring a high level of service. Costs are continuously benchmarked and reviewed in line with other contractors.\"",
      "Jane Steel, who bought a one-bedroom flat in Milton Keynes as an investment for her family, is another leaseholder who has told the BBC of her dissatisfaction with Eagerstates.",
      "The combined service charge for the 80-flat block was \u00a360,000 when she and her partner bought the property in 2016. Three years later, it was \u00a3250,000.",
      "Jane, who has an accountancy background, spent weeks going through invoices and says she came across numerous questionable charges, including more than \u00a338,000 to repair lifts that were only a year old. She says the block's leaseholders were also overcharged more than \u00a360,000 in electricity costs.",
      "Assethold said this was \"simply incorrect\", adding that it had credited \u00a320,000 to leaseholders and that future accounts \"will be reduced accordingly\". It said an independent surveyor \"found that the lift was well maintained and was showing age consistent with the installation made\".",
      "'I'm mentally exhausted after \u00a32k service charge hike'",
      "Flat owners' misery over soaring service charges",
      "'Fighting my management company took over my life'",
      "Jane has also complained of many other charges she says are inflated, such as one for \u00a32,640 to put fire safety signs on 25 doors.",
      "Jane says the contractor, Superior Facilities Maintenance {SFM), has billed tens of thousands of pounds for poor-quality work at the building and Eagerstates pays up \"no questions asked\".",
      "Assethold said: \"Any works carried out would be backed up with images and an invoice. We do inspect the properties regularly and do speak to the contractor if any complaints are raised about the works.\"",
      "The BBC has seen dozens of invoices for work by SFM on other buildings, including Sue's and James\u2019s.",
      "Last summer they received a bill for \u00a34,500 from the company, via Eagerstates, for repairs to lead work on the roof. \u201cThey [the contractors] came for a short amount of time - I don\u2019t know what they did up there - then they charged us all that money for it,\u201d James says.",
      "Sue and James have shown me an invoice from SFM that shows they were charged for scaffolding, when they say only a ladder was used to access the roof.",
      "We tried to contact Superior Facilities Maintenance but the phone number listed online didn't connect and its website was defunct.",
      "Leaseholders have shown the BBC invoices that were issued by SFM through Eagerstates. The cost of the work detailed in them amounted to \u00a398,000 since 2022.",
      "We have discovered that SFM hasn't submitted accounts to Companies House, which is a criminal offence. According to Companies House, it has been sent six letters about this.",
      "By delving into the various tribunal documents, we have found other complaints about Eagerstates\u2019 use of SFM.",
      "In a recent case, a judge accepted there had been \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d when  SFM was employed to do roof repairs and said there were \u201csignificant concerns about the quality of the works\u201d. In this case, the judge disallowed almost all the \u00a321,000 charged by SFM.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and copious correspondence between ourselves and the leaseholders about the contractor.\"",
      "SFM has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.",
      "'All contractors are bona fide'",
      "While a tribunal does not have powers make judgments on potential criminality or other possible wrongdoing, one judge said they were \u201cnot satisfied\u201d that an invoice provided by SFM, for \u00a31,750, was \u201cbona fide\u201d.",
      "Assethold said: \"That is simply not the case and defamatory by the judge; there was clear transparency and the invoice is bona fide. How a judge can say that with no evidence is absurd and we are considering making a complaint about the judge and these comments as there must be evidence to say this.\"",
      "That invoice was one of several questioned by Raymond Shaw.",
      "He is a leaseholder at a block owned by Assethold in Stratford, east London. He has 20 years' experience working as a criminal lawyer, specialising in fraud. Raymond says the way the company operates makes him \u201craise an eyebrow\".",
      "In 2018, the service charge was a little over \u00a3900 a year. The latest annual bill was for more than \u00a36,000 - a 560% rise.",
      "Assethold disputes the sums provided by Raymond, however he says he and his wife  spent \u201cweeks and months\u201d poring over their bills and looking into the companies Eagerstates works with. They say several are new and others close after a short period.",
      "They believe there are links between some of them, including family connections to the cleaning firm used at his flat block.",
      "Assethold said: \"This is simply not so; all contractors are bona fide and independent.\"",
      "Raymond says the block of 11 flats was charged \u00a310,000 for cleaning last year but the service is \u201catrocious\u201d and, despite the high cost, the building is filthy and bins aren\u2019t collected, causing a problem with rats and a terrible smell.",
      "Assethold said: \"Rubbish piles up due to various short lets and abuse by the residents which means waste is constantly dumped in the property.\"",
      "At a tribunal last year, Raymond and some of his neighbours were awarded back almost \u00a360,000 because of overcharging that took place over a three-year period.",
      "Assethold said \"This included mostly estimated charges, and we have refunded any monies to the leaseholders.\"",
      "'How can they take that away from me?'",
      "The advice given to leaseholders who dispute their service charge is to pay up and take the matter up later, or they could face losing their property in a process known as forfeiture - a measure described as \u201cdraconian\u201d by Sebastian O\u2019Keefe from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership.",
      "Sue withheld some of her payment in protest over her charges and was threatened with a possession order by Eagerstates, meaning that if she didn\u2019t pay in full, it would start forfeiture proceedings to claim the entire value of her property.",
      "Sue says: \u201cI couldn't believe that. This is my flat, this is my home. How can they take that away from me? I've bought it, it\u2019s mine.",
      "\u201cI still can't cope with it. I get really upset about it.\"",
      "Ji Hoon Yoon, an Assethold leaseholder who won his legal dispute with the firm, is one of many people who have told me of issues with the tribunal system. \"There's nothing within the judicial system to link up all of these cases, even if they've done this time and time again,\" he says.",
      "He has set up a company to help leaseholders trying to challenge charges.",
      "The professional body for managing agents, the Property Institute, is calling for building managers to be regulated - something that hasn't been included in new laws the government is bringing in that are aimed at strengthening leaseholders' powers.",
      "Jane is taking legal action in a bid to win the right to manage her building because, as it stands, she says her flat is unsellable.",
      "\"There's a whole mixture of emotions, really, from anger to disappointment to just unfairness, that the laws aren't there to help,\" she says.",
      "Sue and James have successfully applied to buy the freehold on their building, a Victorian conversion consisting of two flats. I was in Worthing County Court last month when they discovered that Assethold hadn't registered the property to the Land Registry and so was not the legal owner of the freehold.",
      "Granting the pair permission to buy the freehold, the judge said the case was \"extraordinary\", adding that Assethold \"haven't even bothered to turn up\" to give its version of events.",
      "Sue, who describes Assethold as \"a big black cloud over my head\", is looking forward to having control of her home, and finances, once again.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:05:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Hi-tech coatings make all sorts of high performance engineering, like jet engines, possible.",
    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "story": [
      "If it hadn't been for the squirrels, George Matthew's attempt to become a cocoa bean producer might have failed.",
      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",
      "\"This complex process involves several stages and the activity of various micro-organisms, which help develop the beans' flavour, aroma, and colour,\" he says.",

      "From bean to bar: How chocolate is made",
      "To raise the quantity and quality of cocoa bean production, the government has introduced several initiatives.",
      "It is investing in schemes to develop hybrid cocoa plants, that are more productive than existing varieties.",
      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",
      "Business is also investing in new cocoa tree vareities.",
      "Dr Minimol J.S., is the head of cocoa research at Kerala Agriculture University and is working with Cadbury to develop hybrid cocoa trees.",
      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",
      "\"We are constantly focussing on improving the post-harvest practices for cocoa farmers in India,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Indian farmers need to be producing higher quality beans.",
      "\"We are not able to compete with international players in the bulk cocoa bean segment,\u201d he says.",
      "While there has been improvement, Indian producers have some way to go.",
      "\"Over the last decade, in the fine-flavour cocoa bean segment, India has started to get noticed... but it will be several years before all Indian fine flavour cocoa beans reach a stage of large-scale international recognition.\"",
      "Back in Kerala, Dr Matthew reflects on his decade as a cocoa farmer.",
      "\"It's a tricky plant,\" he says. \"Last year I had no yield. So no farmer can depend solely on cocoa - one has to plant other trees along with it.\"",
      "Despite the challenges, he's optimistic. \"The future is bright, with huge demand.\"",

    "summary": "The Mayor of London's free school lunch policy is praised by a new independent report.",
    "story": [
      "The Mayor of London has said his policy of free lunch for every pupil at state primary schools in London will continue despite questions about how he will pay for it.",
      "His free lunches for every primary school child scheme was praised by a new independent report that found it had brought \u201csignificant benefits\u201d for the capital\u2019s children, parents and schools.",
      "But the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee was told next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "Sadiq Khan told BBC London: \u201cAs long as I am mayor of this great city I will make sure we carry on with this fantastic policy.\u201d",
      "The scheme provided meals to 287,000 children in its first year, at a cost of \u00a3135m. It is currently in its second year, with the cost having risen to \u00a3140m.",
      "The policy is currently being budgeted for on a year-by-year basis.",
      "The mayor said: \"We will be publishing our budget in due course and setting out confirmation that this policy will carry on next year.\"",
      "He added: \"My promise to Londoners is for as long as I am mayor, children going to state primary schools will receive this offer of a universal free school meal.\"",
      "Khan was re-elected in May and his third term of office ends in May 2028.",
      "Speaking to the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, Richard Watts, the mayor's deputy chief of staff, said \u201cthe scheme has been enormously successful\u201d and \u201call the benefits that we hoped we would see based on previous evidence we are now seeing city wide\u201d.",
      "However, he said next year\u2019s funding for the scheme was not in place yet.",
      "He said: \"The whole of the mayor\u2019s budget is \u00a3130m, we think free school meals will cost \u00a3140m next year so even if we canned everything else that we did, universal free school meals will never be met from the GLA (Greater London Authority) mayor budget.",
      "\"Therefore we will announce that funding in the group budget papers in due course.\u201d",
      "Khan launched the scheme in 2023 as a one-year emergency measure to help families with the cost of living, paid for using higher than expected business rate receipts.",
      "In January this year, he announced that he had extended it for a further 12 months, to cover the 2024-25 academic year. It was again funded largely using business rate receipts which were \u201cmore buoyant than we expected\u201d.",
      "The committee heard that the GLA and mayor would have to wait until next year when the government is due to set out its multi-year plans for local government funding before setting budgets for the mayor\u2019s manifesto pledges.",
      "The mayor\u2019s chief of staff David Bellamy told the assembly\u2019s budget committee the free school meals scheme was \"not something substantively that the GLA mayoral budget has the resources to do, so that is something we will be dealing with in the group budget from the total income sources available to the mayor - we will set that out in the draft budget in January\u201d.",
      "'Positive impact'",
      "The research published by Impact on Urban Health, a group which forms part of the Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 Foundation, found that \u201cparents, whatever their household income, welcomed the policy and wanted it to continue\u201d, as \u201cthey felt it countered the effects of the rising cost of living and, in many cases, had a positive impact on family life\u201d.",
      "The scheme had also been \u201cvalued highly by those working in schools\u201d, the report found, with senior leaders saying it had \u201chelped to address the problems of hidden hunger and food insecurity\u201d.",
      "According to data collected by City Hall, in a sample of 259 schools \u2013 making up 13% of London primary schools \u2013 the scheme\u2019s average take-up was 89.1% of children across the 2023-2024 academic year.",
      "The research states: \u201cWe found the policy had greater benefits for families who were living in poverty or living on low incomes\u2026 but more affluent families were also strongly in favour of the policy, as they felt it acted as a leveller at school\u201d.",
      "It adds: \u201cSchool food costs are just one of many costs families face, including increased utilities and housing costs. Families have also noticed other school-related costs continuing to rise. This has diluted the financial effects of the policy for some families.\u201d",
      "Looking at the impact on pupils\u2019 performance in school, the report says that the policy \u201cappears to be supporting calmer behaviour in the classroom, with school staff reporting afternoon lessons running more smoothly when children have had a hot, healthy meal\u201d.",

      "He had claimed two men targeted him in a hate-crime, yelling racial slurs and putting a noose around his neck while he was walking down the street near his apartment.",

      "The title of Barbara Taylor Bradford's most celebrated, and first, novel A Woman of Substance could well have been used to describe the author herself.",
      "The 1979 story of a young woman's journey from rags to riches went from bestseller to super-seller in a year and stayed on the New York Times list for 43 weeks.",
      "Bradford wrote more than 30 further books - again, all bestsellers - amounting to more than 90 million copies bought worldwide and netting her a fortune of more than \u00a3100m.",
      "Although she also wrote about male protagonists, Bradford's speciality was capturing the essence of what it meant to be a strong, determined woman fighting against the odds to succeed.",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Barbara Taylor Bradford dies aged 91",
      "Her stories were dense and epic  - often period family sagas which ran into a book series - full of drama, passion and humanity which consequently made rich material for adaptation.",
      "Several of her novels were turned into TV films or miniseries, many produced by her adored and adoring husband of 55 years, Robert \"the General\" Bradford.",
      "Remarkably, given how prolific she was, Bradford always wrote in long-hand or on an electric typewriter and claimed almost never to have writer's block.",
      "She worked long, dogged hours and described herself to the Guardian as \"stoical and strong\" and with a \"backbone of steel,\" like her heroines.",
      "She added: \"They're all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I've written about myself in every book.\"",
      "Bradford was born in 1933 in a suburb of Leeds and was an only child (her older brother died before she was born) doted on by her mother and father, who was an engineer father.",
      "Although the family wasn't wealthy, the young Barbara was pampered and always impeccably turned out. \"I always had a new Whitsuntide bonnet and patent shoes and little white socks,\" she recalled in 2006.",
      "And looking good became very much part of Bradford's larger-than-life adult persona, which was unerringly draped in designer elegance and expensive jewellery. She also developed a keen eye for priceless art.",
      "As for her formation, her mother had high hopes. She encouraged her to read classic literature, such as Dickens and the Brontes, and sent her to private school.",
      "Bradford later fictionalised her parents' marriage in her novel Act of Will. It was dedicated to her mother, who she said \"gave me the greatest gift a mother can give a child, the desire to excel\".",
      "A 2005 biography of Bradford suggested she was indeed descended from lofty stock by way of her mother, who was, it said, the illegitimate daughter of a marquis. Bradford was initially furious at the story, but with time said she'd \"come round\".",
      "Bradford's own writing aspirations began at the age of 10, when her proud mother sent a story her daughter had written to a magazine, and - after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it - she was hooked.",
      "At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but was soon taken on as a reporter.",
      "\"It was because I was such a bad typist and was ruining so much of their expensive paper!\" she joked. Nevertheless, at 18 she became the newspaper's Woman's Page editor.",
      "By the age of 20, she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \"I was very, very driven from the age of 10. That's what I wanted to be - a reporter,\" she recalled in 2019.",
      "The year 1961 turned out to be significant for Bradford after she was roped into a blind date.",
      "The unknown beau was the rich and successful film producer Robert Bradford. He was \"movie-star gorgeous,\" and it was pretty much love at first sight, she recalled. Two years later they were married and living in New York.",
      "She continued her career in journalism, including covering interior design and lifestyles, before trying her hand at children's and decorating books. But her childhood desire to write grown-up fiction was still bubbling under the surface.",
      "After several failed attempts at suspense novels, Bradford stopped and took stock.",
      "\"I was in my late thirties. I thought: what if I get to 55, and I've never written a novel? I'm going to hate myself. I'm going to be one of those bitter, unfulfilled writers,\" she said in her 2006 Guardian interview.",
      "That's when she embarked on the saga-driven journey that made her name, fortune and shaped her life, selling A Woman of Substance to a publisher on the strength of a 10-page outline and 192 pages.",
      "A Woman of Substance took her two years to write, with the original manuscript running to 1,520 pages. It told the story of Emma Harte, the kitchen maid of a wealthy Yorkshire family, who, through grit and fierce ambition, became the boss of a huge retail empire.",
      "Harte was ruthless but also warm-hearted and fair and readers loved her, making the novel a global best-seller. Realising she'd struck gold, Bradford went on produce six further Emma Harte novels, charting her growth and the lives of her children.",
      "Talking about the story's appeal, Bradford said it had \"everything in it\u2026 drama, intrigue, money, passion, power and revenge - all of those great human emotions that make for a good story\".",
      "\"Woman all over the world told me that Emma Harte was their true role model, and that the book had changed their lives for the better.",
      "\"I had set out to simply tell a good story about a strong woman. I hadn't intended to send a message. But apparently, quite unconsciously I had.",
      "\"All I know is that I wrote the kind of story I love to tell about an ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary in living her life a certain way and goes out to conquer the world.\"",
      "A Woman of Substance was the first of her books to be adapted for TV. It became an Emmy Award-nominated series in 1985, starring Jenny Seagrove, Deborah Kerr and Liam Neeson.",
      "Two other books from the series were also made for TV, Hold the Dream and To Be the Best.",
      "Bradford revelled in her craft, writing at great lengths with novels often stretching to more than 500 pages.",
      "She wrote multiple stand-alone works yet, with often more ideas about her protagonists and their families than would fit into one book, Bradford produced further series, including The Ravenscar trilogy, The Clarendon Chronicles and The House of Falconer.",
      "The Ravenscar Dynasty (one of a trilogy), is set in Edwardian England, and told through the eyes of its handsome, kind but driven hero, Edward Deravenel, who is locked in a vicious battle for the family business.",
      "\"It's very dramatic and it's actually a retelling of the Wars of the Roses, but in modern times. I just took the life of Edward IV and told it in modern terms,\" Bradford explained to the Daily Express, adding she researched how to kill people with poisons, \"so there's quite a lot of deaths.\"",
      "And though the main character is male, the stories also unfailingly follow Bradford's formula of depicting strong, memorable women within the cast, along with another Bradford ingredient - passion.",
      "\"Women always say to me, 'Don't stop writing those nice sex scenes.' But, really, I'm more interested in the protagonist's character,\" Bradford told the Telegraph.",
      "\"So, either she's going to be a wimp, and do nothing, or she's going to be driven and ambitious. Character is what drives everything forward.\"",
      "Accordingly, many of Bradford's novels had motivational titles such as To Be The Best, Everything to Gain and Her Own Rules.",
      "Robert Bradford played a large role in his wife's work and, she said, shepherded her career.  In addition to making screen versions of his wife's stories, he liked to be involved in their promotion.",
      "He was the first person to buy a full-page ad on the back page of the New York Times Arts section.",
      "Robert also loved to buy her gifts, most notably jewellery, no fewer than five pieces a year. She also accumulated countless handbags.",
      "When Robert died after having a stroke in 2019, Bradford was totally devastated.",
      "\"We were everything to each other,\" she said. \"But I have to keep going. Bob always thought I was a strong woman. He liked strong women - never had time for those little fragile blondes.\"",
      "She had auctioned off some pieces of jewellery in 2013 and, following his death and her move into a smaller apartment, Bradford sold more, saying she just didn't have enough room.",
      "Eventually, Bradford found some solace by turning to her most-loved original characters, announcing she was writing a prequel to A Woman of Substance, this time focusing on Emma Harte's great friend Shane \"Blackie\" O'Neill.",
      "Quoted in the press release for the book, Bradford said: \"After my beloved husband, Bob Bradford, died in the summer, Blackie O'Neill came back into my head.",
      "\"Bob was by my side at the beginning when I wrote A Woman of Substance,\" she said, \"and I felt compelled to tell Blackie's story. The true Blackie O'Neill will be revealed and fans of Emma Harte will be able to live his tumultuous life with him.\"",
      "The book was due to be published in November 2020.",
      "Bradford was awarded an OBE in 2007 and recognised as one of 90 Great Britons celebrated in a special portrait to mark the Queen's 90th birthday.",
      "\"I might not always take myself seriously, but I take my work very seriously,\" she said of herself.",
      "And to those aspiring to match her at her art, Bradford cautioned: \"When people say: 'I want to write a novel and be rich and famous like you,' I say: 'Well, you're not going to be.' I say it to shock them. That is the wrong motivation. You should want to do the work so much that nothing else matters. I simply had to write fiction.\""

    "story": [
      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",
      "\"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity,\" he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.",
      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",
      "He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.",
      "\"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn\u2019t,\" he told the BBC\u2019s Focus on Africa podcast this week.",
      "\"It\u2019s saying there\u2019s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. It\u2019s still saying there\u2019s death in every tear,\" he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.",
      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",
      "The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.",
      "For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.",
      "That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.",
      "For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.",
      "The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.",
      "\"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency,\" Lena Bheeroo, Bond\u2019s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement.",
      "Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on \"colonial tropes\".",
      "The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.",
      "While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.",
      "\"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that\u2019s a big, big change,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering\u2026 the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception.\"",
      "The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.",
      "A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.",
      "For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.",
      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

      "\"And then everything happened...\"",
      "Everything, in case you have not been following Gigi's story, involved scoring a global hit single out of nowhere.",
      "Sailor Song, an aching love ballad about falling for a woman who looks like the actress Anne Hathaway, exploded online in June and quickly became a real-world success.",
      "In the UK, it went to number one, ending Sabrina Carpenter's nine-week run at the top.",

      "When she found out it had reached number one, \"I got out of the shower and just started crying,\" Gigi told the UK's Official Charts Company.",
      "The success marks a neat conclusion to a messy origin story.",
      "Born in New Jersey and raised in Florida, Gigi was a drama school nerd who turned to music when she realised she was \"never going to be cast in the ingenue role\".",
      "Self-taught on piano and guitar, she went straight to the top of the US streaming charts, in 2021, with her self-released debut single, Sometimes (Backwood).",
      "The song earned her a contract with Interscope Records and Gigi supported Coldplay on their Music of the Spheres tour before she had even played a headline show of her own.",
      "Looking back, she says that initial wave of success created a pressure to expand her career too quickly. For a long time, she felt \"stuck and limited\" by her lack of progression.",
      "\"It was this cognitive dissonance where I\u2019d get an amazing slot [on someone else's tour] but didn\u2019t know who\u2019d be coming to the show,\" Gigi says.",
      "And by the time she played London last November, she knew she had reached breaking point.",
      "\"I asked God, or the universe, 'Open the doors that need to be opened and close the doors that need to be shut,'\" she says.",
      "\"I knew it had to happen - but I was so terrified of what that meant.\"",

      "\"There are times where I spend a lot of time thinking about a song and what I want to say. This was one of those times where it just blew out.\"",
      "She teased it on TikTok in April, released it in July - and, as of Wednesday 20 November, it has been streamed 340 million times on Spotify alone.",
      "In some ways, it is an unlikely hit. The production is low-tech and homespun and Gigi's vocals are androgynous to the point where many listeners were surprised to find it was a song about two women in love.",
      "But the chorus is undeniable.",
      "\"Kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor,\" she sings. \"And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavour?\"",

      "\"Growing up gay in an environment where you\u2019re not allowed to be that was very taxing on me,\" Gigi told the Bringin' It Backwards podcast, in 2022.",
      "Her faith was really shaken, however, when her big sister Celene died suddenly, aged 22, in the early months of 2020.",
      "The shock and the pain are unimaginable. The foundations of Gigi's world were destabilised forever.",
      "In her music, she tried to explain the unexplainable.",
      "\"The other day, I thought of something funny/ But no-one would've laughed but you,\" she sang in a song simply called Celene.",
      "\"And Mom and Dad are always crying/ And I wish I knew what to do.\"",
      "Gigi's latest release, Fable, is another attempt to confront that grief, lashing out at  people who feebly offered \"thoughts and prayers\" after her sister's death, and wondering why disconnecting from faith makes her \"skin start to burn\".",
      "\"One of the hardest parts about my grief is that I didn't have any music that touched  on my life, on my situation, to get me through it,\" she says.",
      "\"And so I made it for myself.",
      "\"I've written tons of grief songs but, finally, in Fable, I said it in the way I always felt, from the very day I lost her, and I was so just relieved by the expression of it.\"",
      "That catharsis is a sort of self-healing. And, more than anything, the singer wants her music to find its way to others who need it.",
      "\"One of my biggest wishes is to not let this experience that is so dark and isolating stay that way,\" she says.",
      "\"My hope is that there can be some way this [music] can help. And it's amazing, because I've been seeing a lot of that. It's been very healing for me.\"",
      "And with that ability to reach people in their most vulnerable moments, it won't be long before Gigi sees her name tattooed on many more arms."

      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",
      "\"It's great that people picked up on it, and here I am still gigging, speaking out and getting to see the world.\"",

      "Critics have so far given the film mixed reviews. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw praised the \"sugar-rush fantasy\" and awarded four stars, describing Wicked as a \"blast of entertainment power\".",
      "There was another four-star review from Empire's Helen O'Hara, who said director Jon M Chu \"uses every bell and whistle possible to turn the stage show into a movie epic\".",
      "However, in a two-star review, the Telegraph's Robbie Collin described Wicked as \"utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast\", adding that there was \"no conceivable artistic argument\" to have split the the Broadway show into two films.",
      "The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey awarded three stars and questioned the way it was shot, with characters often \"aggressively backlit\".",
      "\"Jon M Chu treats his Oz as if it were as mundane as a city block,\" she added.",
      "But Screen Daily's Fionnuala Halligan concluded: \"It\u2019s so doggedly faithful to the show, so emphatically orchestrated and so powered by Cynthia Erivo's exceptional performance, that resistance to its 169 minutes of theme park magic becomes futile.\"",
      "Erivo, who received a best actress nomination at the Oscars for her portrayal of Harriet Tubman in the biopic Harriet in 2019, is also a decorated stage performer who received a Tony Award in 2016 for the Broadway adaptation of The Color Purple.",

      "\"Whether you feel 'other', or you feel different from everyone else, I think both of us have experience in those spaces that we have used to infuse our characters,\" she says.",
      "Wicked, which first came to Broadway in 2003, has gone on to be the third-highest grossing theatre show in the world, behind The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera.",
      "Many have pinned its enduring success with audiences on the relatability of its content - from Elphaba's struggle with self-identity to Glinda's difficulty in making moral choices.",
      "Its reimagining for the big screen also stars Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage as the voice of Doctor Dillamond - who is an animated goat.",
      "Oscar nominee Jeff Goldblum appears as the Wizard of Oz and British star Jonathan Bailey - who has received international recognition in recent years after starring in Netflix hit Bridgerton - as Fiyero.",
      "Goldblum says the central themes of the film, which include embracing diversity, were important to the cast, who were able to \"come together to work and appreciate each other with empathy, compassion and love\".",
      "Bailey also says everyone he worked with had their own \"Elphaba story\", adding \"we have at points in our lives felt different\".",
      "He says: \"In this film particularly, it's the superpower of individuality which becomes a power to harness.",
      "\"I think it's really important right now as well, this theme that there's more that unites us than divides us.\"",
      "The musical has been a West End and Broadway institution for more than 20 years, but Chu says the central themes of the plot are more relevant than ever.",
      "\"Elphaba says something has changed within me, something's not the same - and that's the line that really got me into this movie, I felt like we all feel uneasy,\" he says.",
      "Chu, who also directed Crazy Rich Asians in 2018, says he received the script for the film during the pandemic, which made him think about how the film could reflect his real-life experience of looking for truth in a confusing time.",
      "He says the cast also made themselves \"emotionally available\" during filming and were able to put themselves personally in the shoes of their characters.",
      "\"Ariana, Cynthia and Jeff were talking about the real-world stakes of what we were putting into these characters,\" he adds.",
      "\"It wasn't just about global politics, it was more personal than that.",

    "title": "Christmases gone wrong inspire Love Actually writer's new film",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:49:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

    "summary": "BBC journalist Hazel Martin was told she had liver fibrosis and must go teetotal or she could die.",
    "story": [
      "At 31 years old, I was told by doctors that if I didn\u2019t stop drinking alcohol, I could die.",
      "I was shocked because I didn\u2019t drink every day, I never drank alone and I drank because I enjoyed it as a social activity, not because I felt alcohol-dependent.",
      "But by definition, my alcohol consumption from my late teens to late 20s would be considered binge drinking. It felt normal because people around me were doing the same - and now it was catching up with me.",
      "I\u2019d recently become a mum and had gone to the GP because I felt tired all the time. This led to blood tests and a liver function check.",
      "Further tests revealed I had severe alcohol-related liver fibrosis, or extreme scarring on my liver, most likely because of my drinking habits.",
      "I trundled home from the hospital in a daze, with my daughter in her pram. This might have happened to me, I thought, but I could not be the only one.",
      "I wanted to know what this said about the UK\u2019s drinking culture and began looking into it for BBC Panorama.",
      "Alcohol-specific deaths are at their highest levels in the UK since records began in 2001.",
      "While the problem is undoubtedly bigger in men - particularly older men - more women under the age of 45 are dying due to alcohol-related liver disease, or ARLD, than ever before, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures from 2001-22.",
      "If we binge a given amount of alcohol in one go - for example on a night out - it can be much more damaging than if we drink the same amount over a longer period.",
      "The latest research, by a team at University College London and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, suggests bingeing may be up to four times as damaging for the liver.",
      "When we think of binge drinking, we tend to imagine people drunkenly sprawling out of bars and falling over at bus stops. But actually,  a binge can be less alcohol than you might think.",
      "In the UK, a binge is considered as drinking six or more units of alcohol in one sitting for women, and eight or more for men. That is two large glasses of wine for a woman.",
      "At King's College Hospital in London, consultant hepatologist Debbie Shawcross tells me that she regularly treats professional women in their 40s and 50s with liver disease.",
      "\u201cThey're spinning plates in the air, and maybe they have young families,\u201d she says. \u201cThey're not alcoholics... but they are just drinking too much as a habit.\u201d",
      "I\u2019m not in my 40s yet, but she could have been describing me.",
      "When I was younger, I would easily drink more than what\u2019s defined as a binge on a night out. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until I got my diagnosis.",
      "After my blood tests came back as abnormal I was sent to Glasgow\u2019s New Victoria Hospital, where I had an ultrasound, and finally a fibroscan. All this took place over the course of about a year.",
      "A fibroscan is a type of non-invasive ultrasound which measures liver stiffness. A reading of seven kPA (a unit used to measure the level of oxygen in the blood) or below is considered normal. My reading was 10.2.",
      "This indicated severe scarring - if it had not been caught, and if I had not stopped drinking, it could have developed into cirrhosis.",
      "I received my diagnosis in February 2024. My consultant, Dr Shouren Datta, said if I abstained from alcohol, then there was a possibility that my fibrosis could be reversed.",
      "I feel extremely lucky that the problem was picked up in time for me to try to do something about it.",
      "Doctors had discovered the problem while investigating my tiredness.",
      "However, part of the problem with liver disease is that there are often no initial symptoms.",
      "Seven in 10 people with end-stage liver disease don\u2019t know anything about it until they are admitted to hospital with symptoms such as jaundice, fluid retention and abnormal bleeding.",
      "That is what happened to Emma Jones, 39, originally from north Wales. I met her 15 months after her successful liver transplant.",
      "Like me, Emma was a social drinker, with a successful career and vibrant social life. But during the Covid lockdowns things spiralled for her - at the worst point, she was drinking three bottles of wine a day.",
      "Emma was admitted to hospital where she found out she was in end-stage liver disease. She was given less than 36 hours to live.",
      "Miraculously, she pulled through and - after fulfilling the required six months of sobriety - got the transplant she so desperately needed.",
      "Emma\u2019s recovery is ongoing and is not without major life changes. She will be on anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life and is immunosuppressed, meaning it is harder for her body to fight infections and disease.",
      "But she is alive, well, and says she is in the best place she has ever been. I find her positivity and determination infectious.",
      "\u2018Gin o\u2019clock\u2019",
      "According to the most recent ONS statistics, from 2018, liver disease is consistently among the top three causes of death each year among women aged 39-45.",
      "\u201cWomen's drinking pretty much doubled in a really short period of time\u2026 about 10 years,\u201d Prof Fiona Measham, a leading expert in drink and drug culture from the University of Liverpool, tells me.",
      "Her research suggests that in the 1990s and 2000s, the alcohol industry zeroed in on female drinkers, targeting them with products such as alcopops and shots - and using feminism, female empowerment and liberation as a marketing tool.",
      "She thinks these practices established a drinking culture in a whole generation of young women that would leave a lasting legacy.",
      "\u201cWhat we're seeing now is that young people, their consumption is falling fastest, but it's still holding quite steady for people in their 30s, 40s and 50s,\u201d she says.",
      "The same aggressive approach persists today within the alcohol industry, believes Prof Carol Emslie, from Glasgow Caledonian University. Only now it is pushing things like prosecco, \u201cgin o\u2019clock\u201d and \u201cwine time\u201d as a way for women to relax and practise self-care after a hard day.",
      "The Portman Group, which represents the alcohol industry, says:",
      "While \u201cthe increase in alcohol-related liver disease among both women and men in the UK is a serious concern, it\u2019s important to remember that alcohol has always been a legal product.\u201d",
      "It says its Code of Practice\u2026 \u201cdoes not protect against gender-based marketing specifically\u201d but sets \u201cminimum standards for alcohol producers to market their products responsibly\u201d.",

      "Several months after my diagnosis, I went back for a repeat fibroscan to see if there had been any improvement.",
      "I was relieved to see that my fibroscan reading had gone from 10.2 to 4.7 - back in the normal and healthy range.",
      "I was surprised what a dramatic difference cutting out alcohol had made in such a short space of time.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 00:05:04 GMT",
    "summary": "A toxic row has engulfed the NHS, say ministers. So why have doctors turned on physician associates?",
    "story": [
      "Julia\u2019s first four years as a physician associate were everything she hoped they would be. After working in the NHS for the best part of a decade in a non-patient facing role, she was delighted to be on the wards supporting doctors and the wider healthcare teams.",
      "\u201cI loved the contact I had with patients, assessing them and playing a part in their care. I felt supported and part of a team.\u201d",
      "That all changed about a year ago.",
      "\u201cSuddenly we came under attack. Doctors in the radiology department started refusing to talk to me about scans and others have been saying we don\u2019t deserve to get paid what we do.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere has totally changed. We\u2019ve even stopped going into the canteen as we were being made to feel uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "'Destructive situation'",
      "Julia is far from alone. United Medical Associate Professionals (UMAPs), a body which represents physician (PAs) and anaesthesia associate (AAs), says there are countless examples like this with staff facing bullying and being sidelined.",
      "The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents senior doctors in the NHS, has warned the whole situation has become so \u201cdestructive\u201d that it is damaging teamwork across hospitals and GP surgeries where PAs and AAs work.",
      "It has cited the particularly acrimonious debate on social media, which has seen regular attacks about the pay and professionalism of PAs and AAs as well as discussions about how they can be undermined in the workplace.",
      "This week the Health Secretary Wes Streeting decided he needed to act, ordering a review into PAs and AAs in England to resolve what he said had become a \u201ctoxic\u201d row.",
      "So how has it come to this, with doctors turning against the very people brought in to support them?",
      "The PA role is hardly new in the NHS \u2013 it has been around for 20 years, helping doctors by doing tasks such as taking medical histories and carrying out examinations.",
      "What has changed is the speed at which they are being recruited \u2013 over the last seven years the numbers have gone from a few hundred to 3,500 currently with a target of 12,000, including AAs, by 2036.",
      "'More of a hindrance than a help'",
      "As the numbers have been increasing doctors have become concerned the lines between professions are getting blurred.",
      "Sam is five years into his training and works alongside PAs in a hospital in the south west. \u201cThey are more of a hindrance than a help,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re being placed on rotas instead of doctors \u2013 but there are things they cannot do so doctors end up having to double up.",
      "\u201cAnd for those doctors at the very start of training having PAs on a ward can actually limit their exposure to some of the medical tasks that should be part of their learning. We\u2019ve had enough.\u201d",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), is so concerned it now wants the rollout to be paused while the review takes place.",
      "It says PAs and AAs, who need to complete a two-year master\u2019s following a first degree, which is normally bioscience-related, are being asked to do tasks they are not meant to and filling in for doctors. It argues this is putting patients at risk.",
      "To back up its claims, it points to two high-profile cases where patients \u2013 Emily Chesterton and Susan Pollitt - died after being seen by PAs.",
      "Alongside this, the BMA also cites a survey published last year of 18,000 of its members, which found nearly nine in 10 of those that responded felt the way AAs and PAs currently work in the NHS always or sometimes posed a risk to patient safety.",
      "BMA deputy council leader Dr Emma Runswick says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing PAs doing things, such as ordering scans they are not qualified to order and prescribing drugs that they aren't qualified to prescribe.",
      "\"And when they see patients it\u2019s not always clear to the patient that they are not being seen by a doctor. It\u2019s dangerous and has got to stop.\u201d",
      "The union is calling for a strict set of rules to be drawn up limiting what they can and cannot do. The BMA\u2019s plan would essentially restrict their role to assistants \u2013 helping with ward rounds, taking bloods and chasing up on scan results and making discharge arrangements.",
      "But UMAPs chief Stephen Nash says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about patient safety, but about protecting their interests. They want us to be subservient.\u201d",
      "He says the deaths like those reported are \u201cabsolute tragedies\u201d, but he has concerns about how they are being used to attack a whole profession.",
      "\u201cThere is meant to be a no-blame approach to learning the lessons from failures.\u201d",
      "He says when mistakes are made there are often multiple factors at play, but the campaign against PAs and AAs has meant their role has been singled out. \u201cIt misleads the public,\" he adds.",
      "In the end it will be up to the independent review, which is being led by Royal Society of Medicine president Prof Gillian Leng, to establish the truth on this.",
      "Key will be the NHS England database on patient safety incidents, which services across the country report into.",
      "The data for the past year is not publicly available, but a senior NHS source told me: \u201cThe key here is not whether PAs are making mistakes \u2013 everyone in the NHS does, doctors included \u2013 but whether they are making more mistakes and causing more safety incidents than you would expect.",
      "\"The reports are complex and nuanced quite often, but there\u2019s nothing in there that immediately rings alarm bells.\u201d",
      "This is not just a row that has been played out on the wards of hospitals and consulting rooms of GP surgeries, it has stretched to the highest echelons of the world of medicine.",
      "While the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has remained broadly supportive of the rollout of PAs and AAs, a number of the 23 individual colleges it represents have been engulfed by infighting over the issue, leading to resignations.",
      "'Relationships damaged permanently'",
      "The Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of GPs (RCGP) and Royal College of Anaesthetists have all recently moved towards opposition.",
      "One source close to what has been happening at the royal colleges says: \u201cThere have been some huge rows \u2013 I fear relationships have been damaged permanently. As royal colleges we were always traditionally above the politics of trade unionism.",
      "\u201cThere is a group of doctors that see PAs and AAs as a threat \u2013 we saw the same when nurses took on extra responsibility years ago.\u201d",
      "The lawyers have also been brought in with UMAPs considering action against the RCGP, believing its opposition has cost some PAs their jobs.",
      "And the BMA has already launched a legal case against the General Medical Council, which next month is due to start regulating PAs and AAs. The union does not want the same body responsible for regulating doctors to do the same for PAs and AAs, believing it will blur the lines even further.",
      "What is clear is that this dispute will not be easy to resolve.",
      "And in the meantime, the staff on the frontline are being left to muddle on.",
      "\u201cPAs and AAs are worried every time they go into work,\u201d says Mr Nash. \u201cA very powerful lobby within the medical profession has turned against them. It\u2019s a really horrible time.\u201d"

      "Travellers are being warned of the dangers of methanol poisoning after six tourists to Laos have died.",
      "Methanol is an industrial chemical found in antifreeze and windshield washer fluid.",
      "It's not meant for human consumption and is highly toxic.",
      "Drinking even small amounts can be damaging. A few shots of bootleg spirit containing it can be lethal.",
      "What does methanol do to you?",
      "It looks and tastes like alcohol, and the first effects are similar - it can make you feel intoxicated and sick.",
      "Initially, people might not realise anything is wrong.",
      "The harm happens hours later as the body attempts to clear it from the body by breaking it down in the liver.",
      "This metabolism creates toxic by-products called formaldehyde, formate and formic acid.",
      "These build up, attacking nerves and organs which can lead to blindness, coma and death.",
      "Dr Christopher Morris, a senior lecturer at Newcastle University, said: \"Formate, which is the main toxin produced, acts in a similar way to cyanide and stops energy production in cells, and the brain seems to be very vulnerable to this.",
      "\"This leads to certain parts of the brain being damaged. The eyes are also directly affected and this can cause blindness which is found in many people exposed to high levels of methanol.\"",

      "Some cases can be treated using alcohol (ethanol) to outcompete the methanol metabolism. But this has to be done quickly.",
      "Prof Alastair Hay, an expert in environmental toxicology from the University of Leeds, explained: \"Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor largely preventing methanol breakdown, but markedly slowing it down, allowing the body to vent methanol from the lungs and some through the kidneys, and a little through sweat.\u201d",
      "Dr Hovda said getting help quickly after consuming methanol was crucial to chances of surviving.",
      "\"You can ease all affects if you get to hospital early enough and that hospital has the treatment needed,\" he said.",

After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

      "Cassandra, who stumbled on a Facebook article linking cancer and talc following her diagnosis, said it was used on her as a baby and she continued to use it \"for 20 years or more\".",
      "\"You mimic your mum who used it,\" she said. \"Baby powder was supposed to be something deemed 'safe to use', even on a baby's bum.\"",
      "If it proceeds, the legal action would be the first of its kind brought against the pharmaceutical multinational in the UK.",
      "With 1,900 potential claimants, including cancer patients, survivors and families, lawyers say it is set to be the largest pharmaceutical product group action in English and Welsh legal history.",
      "The BBC has spoken to a number of women with gynaecological cancers - many are part of the group action - who believe their repeated use of talcum powder played a part in their diagnosis.",
      "Their lawyers allege that for decades, talcum powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos - something they claim J&J was aware of but sought to suppress.",
      "J&J denies suppressing any information and denies any links between its baby powder, asbestos and cancer.",
      "\"The doctors said the cancer was unusual for my age at 44,\" says Cassandra, from Alfreton in Derbyshire.",
      "She says she would regularly use talcum powder after a bath or as a deodoriser, including across her genitals.",
      "\"I was just starting my chemo journey when I read about the links, but I felt enraged that a corporate giant like J&J could seem to do this,\" she says.",
      "At first, doctors believed Cassandra's cancer was terminal.",
      "\"I went to the consultation alone,\" she says. \"So I had to come home and tell my husband what they said, tell my parents they would be burying me.",
      "\"I closed down my business unit and laid off staff.",
      "\"I even created a not-so-creative acronym: 'LAC - Life After Cass'.\"",
      "Then, she had an unexpected lifeline. Chemotherapy had in fact triggered an autoimmune condition, giving the impression of late-stage cancer.",
      "Cassandra survived. But the disease still had a devastating effect on her life.",
      "She was forced to give up her business, and an infection during chemotherapy damaged her vocal cords, reducing her voice to a whisper. A hysterectomy to remove cancerous tissue had a huge impact on her body.",
      "\"I was plunged into surgical menopause,\" she says.",
      "\"I would have liked children. I was never blessed that way, but my last ability to have children was taken away due to cancer.\"",
      "Are there links between talcum powder and cancer?",
      "The claims of links between talcum powder and cancer revolve around asbestos - a known carcinogen.",
      "Talc is a mineral that is sometimes used in talcum powders and other cosmetic products, according to Cancer Research UK.",
      "Sophia Lowes, from the charity, said: \"[Talc] can be mined in places where there is asbestos, which can cause the talc to become contaminated. Asbestos is known to cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.",

      "Many documents were hidden from public view until Americans with cancer began suing the firm.",
      "J&J has been accused of knowing decades ago that its baby powder could contain contaminants of asbestos.",
      "J&J has previously said that \"any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false\".",
      "The company discontinued mineral-based talc in North America in 2020 - and followed suit in the UK last year - replacing it with cornstarch. J&J said this was due to financial pressures and a \"misinformation campaign\" around the product.",
      "While the focus of the group action is on the contamination of talc with asbestos, in July this year the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that mineral talc itself was \"probably carcinogenic for humans\".",
      "Deborah, who did not want to be identified by her real name, also lives in Derbyshire, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 29, just two weeks after she and her husband had started trying for a baby.",

      "\"Within two weeks of the first symptoms, I'd had a full hysterectomy,\" she says.",
      "\"I went from excitedly planning for a baby to having all of my parts removed.\"",
      "Deborah's diagnosis was 30 years ago, and she and her husband ultimately went on to adopt.",

      "In the US, the firm has been sued by more than 62,000 people and at least $13bn has been paid out or set aside in response to the action.",
      "Cases there have seen the company found liable for mesothelioma - an asbestos-specific cancer - and gynaecological cancers women suffered after using talc, with billions of dollars awarded in damages.",
      "'Entirely transparent'",

      "Mr Longstaff's firm sent a pre-action letter to J&J in September, a necessary step before starting proceedings. If the case goes ahead, it would likely end up in court next year.",
      "In response, Erik Haas - worldwide vice-president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the allegations against the company \"defy logic, rewrite history and ignore the facts\".",
      "\"J&J takes the issue of talc safety incredibly seriously and always has,\" he says.",
      "\"As our documents show, we have relied upon the most state-of-the-art testing protocols for decades and have been entirely transparent with government institutions and academic researchers regarding our findings.\"",
      "Mr Haas also said the idea that J&J hid the contaminated contents of its products from the public, government and other groups was \"inconceivable and false\".",

      "In a speech at its annual conference on Monday, the boss of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the changes were undermining investment.",
      "Rain Newton-Smith suggested businesses across many sectors were \"being hit by a tough trading environment that just got tougher\" due to changes in National Insurance contributions (NICs) and inheritance tax.",
      "The government said \"difficult choices\" had been made in a bid to \"repair the public finances\", but that it was determined to work with firms.",
      "In her first Budget as chancellor last month, Rachel Reeves announced a near-\u00a370bn increase in public spending, partly funded by increases in taxes on businesses.",
      "While rises in the minimum wage and workers' rights reforms have been praised by unions and workers' groups, bosses have hit out, saying that their businesses are being weighed down by multiple changes at once.",
      "In her speech to the CBI's conference, Ms Newton-Smith argued that \"tax rises like this must never again simply be done to business\".",

      "Stuart Paver, chair of Pavers Shoes, an outlet shop chain with more than 190 stores in the UK and Ireland, told the BBC the tax changes in the Budget would cost his business \u00a34.2m and would \"hinder expansion\".",

      "Last week, a group of major retailers, including Tesco, Amazon and Next, wrote to the chancellor to warn her of the impact tax changes would have.",
      "Firms such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have said they will face a huge jump in costs and they may need to increase prices for customers.",
      "However, others have said that asking multimillion-pound companies to pay more in taxes was one of the fairer ways to improve funding for services like the NHS.",
      "\"No-one is questioning that we need to see the tax rises to really help fund our public services,\" Ms Newton-Smith told the Today programme.",
      "But she said that firms had been taken aback by the lowering of the threshold for the payment of National Insurance, and that the pain was \"really serious\".",
      "In her speech, she urged the government to consider a number of reforms to improve economic growth, such as giving companies more flexibility around how they spend money using the apprenticeship levy.",
      "She also said the chancellor should look at updating business rates for commercial property, as well as simplifying the planning system.",
      "According to reports on Monday, the chancellor will use an opportunity at the conference to respond to criticism of Labour's first Budget in 14 years.",
      "The Guardian suggests she will tell business leaders that they have offered \"no alternative\" to her plans, and that it was necessary to \"wipe the slate clean\" following the General Election.",
      "During the campaign period, Labour had promised that \"working people\" would not see higher taxes in their payslips.",
      "A government spokesperson said the pledge meant that it had had to take \"difficult choices to repair the public finances and to put public finances on a firmer footing\".",
      "\"Despite the difficult inheritance, the government is determined to go for growth and to work in partnership with businesses to invest in Britain's future so we can make every part of the country better off,\" they added."

    "summary": "Government claims have been hotly contested by farmers, and the BBC has been scrutinised for its analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Since the government unveiled its new inheritance tax plans for farmers in last month\u2019s Budget, there has been intense debate about how many people will be affected and to what extent.",
      "Many of the claims from the government have been hotly contested by farmers, and BBC Verify has come under scrutiny over some of the figures it has relied on to try to establish the number of farms impacted by the change.",
      "The debate has revolved around estimates provided by farmers\u2019 groups, including that the new tax could \"harm\" up to 70,000 farms over time.",
      "Our analysis found that the figure was likely to be somewhere closer to the number provided by the government - about 500 estates per year. That remains our assessment.",
      "Farmers' groups say the changes have been \u201cbuilt on bad data\u201d. The government says it wants to make the inheritance tax system fairer and discourage wealthy people from investing in land solely to avoid the tax.",
      "Here, we go through all the numbers and examine the claims and counter-claims.",
      "What are the contested figures?",
      "Under the government\u2019s plans, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be subject to inheritance tax at 20%.",
      "The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) has estimated that the tax change  \u201ccould harm\u201d 70,000 UK farms. This would represent roughly 33% of the 209,000 UK farms, as identified by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "The CLA figure is not an annual one and, clearly, a farm would only be potentially subject to inheritance tax if it was passed on, following a death.",
      "The government, in trying to assess the impact of its tax change, looked instead at recent figures for the number of actual claims for tax relief for agricultural estates.",
      "At this point, it\u2019s worth stressing that an agricultural estate is not the same as a landed estate, or farm: an \u201cestate\u201d is a legal term for the value of the money, property and possessions an individual passes on upon their death. In this case, it\u2019s an estate that includes some agricultural land.",
      "The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has claimed up to about 520 inherited agricultural estates a year \u201cwill be impacted to some extent by these changes\u201d.",
      "The Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said \"three quarters of farmers will pay nothing as a result of the changes\u201d.",
      "But farming groups continue to dispute the government figures, with the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) pointing to other figures from Defra which it says \u201cshow that only 34% of farms are under \u00a31 million net worth\u201d. This would imply that around two thirds of farms could potentially be affected by the Budget tax change.",
      "The NFU has also released analysis which it says shows that \u201caround 75% of commercial family farms will be above the \u00a31 million threshold\u201d.",
      "Below, we look into the challenges when it comes to reaching an exact conclusion on the numbers affected, and provide more detail on which figures are more reliable - and explain why.",
      "Is Defra data more accurate?",
      "Farming groups have partially based their arguments against the tax change on data from Defra\u2019s Farm Business Survey, which shows the net worth of farms in England in 2022/23.",
      "The figures suggest that 17% of farms in England have a net worth - the difference between their assets and liabilities - of between \u00a31m and \u00a31.49m. Another 49% of farms have a value of \u00a31.5m and over.",
      "This suggests, on the face of it, that 66% of farms in England could potentially be affected by the tax changes.",
      "However there are some problems with this calculation, as the data from the Defra survey is not necessarily representative of the overall UK-wide farming sector.",
      "The survey - which is based on a sample of just over 1,350 farms  - states that it is designed to be representative of only about half of the farms in England (rather than the rest of the UK) and also excludes farms which bring in little revenue.",
      "Moreover, the Defra data shows estimates of individual farm values, but does not show their ownership.",
      "Multiple farms can be owned by a single person who then lets them out to tenants. In England about 46% of agricultural holdings were wholly or partially rented out to tenant farmers in 2023 according to Defra data. If the owner of multiple farms sought to pass on those farms upon his or her death, this would all show up in a single estate in the inheritance tax relief claim.",
      "The financial impact would be on that individual\u2019s inheritance tax bill, not each farm.",
      "A farm could also be jointly owned by multiple people. If, for example, five people owned a \u00a35m farm they could each pass on their \u00a31m share without their estates having to pay any inheritance tax.",
      "This is why it is more appropriate to use tax data on inheritance relief, rather than farm survey data, to estimate the impact of the change in the Budget on individuals.",
      "Does including business property relief change the picture?",
      "Another challenge is that some initial government calculations of the number of estates likely to be affected only referred to Agricultural Property Relief (APR) and not Business Property Relief (BPR).",
      "APR relates mainly to the value of land. BPR can include a farm's machinery and livestock, which can also make up a significant proportion of the value of an agricultural estate.",
      "It is true that both APR and BPR relief will be capped at a combined \u00a31m for inheritance tax purposes, meaning a single estate will be able to claim no more than \u00a31m in these combined reliefs.",
      "Farming groups have claimed that farmers often also use BPR so any calculation of the impact of the tax changes based solely on APR claims will not capture the full effect on farming estates.",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "Thousands of farmers protest against inheritance tax changes",
      "However, the government has now published figures based on HMRC inheritance tax data which incorporate historical APR and BPR relief claims, and should capture those agricultural estates making use of both reliefs.",
      "These figures suggest that while taking BPR into account as well as APR does push up the number and proportion of estates likely to be affected, it does not fundamentally change the picture.",
      "The data shows that in 2021-22 the number of estates making combined APR and BPR claims where the value of the estate was more than \u00a31.5m was 383, or 22% of all claims.",
      "The number of estates worth more than \u00a31.5m making APR claims solely was 278, or 16% of the total.",
      "Why is it \u00a31.5m and not \u00a31m?",
      "The government\u2019s latest figures break down the impact using the threshold of \u00a31.5m, not \u00a31m, explaining to BBC Verify that this was chosen based on the assumption that an individual estate\u2019s standard inheritance tax reliefs of \u00a3500,000 would be added to their new \u00a31m allowance.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury and HMRC for a breakdown of the figures using \u00a31m as a threshold - which would be consistent with its original calculations showing APR claims only - but it said it hasn't collated those figures.",
      "The CenTax think tank has studied the impact of APR and BPR reliefs.",
      "CenTax\u2019s co-director Arun Advani argues that the government\u2019s estimates of the number of agricultural estates likely to be affected by the capping of both reliefs at \u00a31m combined - up to 520 estates a year - seems reasonable.",
      "\u201cThe data on historic claims are a much more reliable guide to the number of affected estates than surveys of farm sizes,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhile the government's reforms are certainly likely to be difficult for some farmers, particularly given the many other factors weighing down farmer's incomes, numbers claiming tens of thousands will be affected aren't consistent with the evidence.\u201d",
      "David Sturrock from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that the Treasury\u2019s figures were \u201ccredible\u201d and added that including the impact of capping BPR \u201cdoesn\u2019t radically change the picture in terms of estates affected\u201d.",
      "The NFU has pointed out that if 500 estates were affected per year that could amount to 15,000 over 30 years - but this would still be some way short of the 70,000 figure.",
      "Should small estates be excluded from calculations?",
      "The NFU argues that many estates included in the government figures are too small to be considered working farms.",
      "Its case is simple - if you were to exclude these small farms, the percentage of real, working farms affected would be much higher.",
      "It has pointed to separate APR inheritance tax relief claims data from HMRC, via the Treasury, which breaks down estates by size.",
      "This shows that in 2021-22, 474 claims (27% of the 1,730 total) were for estates valued between \u00a30 and \u00a3250,000, and that 398 (23% of the total) were for estates valued at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000.",
      "\u201cVery few viable farms are worth under \u00a31m,\u201d says the NFU president Tom Bradshaw.",
      "That's a reasonable argument.",
      "If estates with a value below \u00a3500,000 were excluded from the APR figures, the share of the total affected each year would automatically rise from the 27% implied by the government\u2019s initial calculations.",
      "The NFU\u2019s analysis suggests only including what it categorises as \u201cworking farms\u201d would increase the share affected from 27% to 49%.",
      "However, the estimated absolute number of affected estates - roughly 500 in each year - would not be affected by that change.",
      "Is there a \u00a33m allowance?",
      "A key question is where the effective financial inheritance tax threshold for estates with agricultural assets kicks in.",
      "Farming groups have suggested the value of any inherited estate with agricultural assets over \u00a31m will be impacted.",
      "This is understandable as this was the threshold figure cited in the Budget.",
      "However, the government has since claimed that the effective threshold for many farmers\u2019 estates to pay inheritance tax could be not \u00a31m, but \u00a33m, because of various inheritance tax reliefs available to estates.",
      "A higher effective threshold would have a major impact on the proportion and number of estates affected.",
      "The government\u2019s claim is based on the fact that the estates of farmers, like the estates of everyone else subject to inheritance tax, are eligible for a standard tax-free allowance, known as a nil-rate band, of \u00a3325,000.",
      "They are are also eligible for the residential nil-rate band of \u00a3175,000. The latter is available to people who are passing on a main residence to a direct descendant, such as children or grandchildren, as part of their estate. Together these two allowances total \u00a3500,000.",
      "This is on top of the \u00a31m tax-free allowance for agricultural estates.",
      "It\u2019s not just the \u00a31.5m allowance for a single individual - for anyone married their spouse has a similar effective allowance. Adding these together - and allowing for the ability of farming couples to share their allowances - does create a potential for some farming estates to pass on \u00a33m entirely free of inheritance tax.",
      "However, importantly, this could only be achieved if each partner passed on \u00a31.5m of their total assets at death sequentially, rather than in one \u00a33m estate upon the death of the second partner.",
      "The ability of estates to push up the threshold to \u00a33m will also depend on individual circumstances. Of course, not every farmer is married, and some might not be passing on a main residence.",
      "However, it\u2019s legitimate to assume that many farming estates would be able to use these allowances, which are used by the rest of the population.",
      "Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that a farming estate can be affected by this inheritance tax change, without the estate necessarily ending up paying more money in tax, because of the need for individuals to spend more time planning their tax arrangements than they did before.",

      "The quarterly cap by regulator Ofgem sets a limit on the cost of each unit of energy, and affects 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "It was always meant to be a backstop, and Ofgem said more options had emerged from suppliers, with a greater choice of fixed-price tariffs for customers.",
      "The best deals are cheaper than tariffs based on the price cap. But, while offering certainty, anyone signing up risks missing out were prices to fall later next year.",
      "Ofgem has admitted that prices are volatile and difficult to predict.",

      "Difficult winter",
      "Energy bills have been high for three years, which charities warn has left many struggling to cope and choosing to go without heating at the coldest time of year.",
      "After two relatively mild winters since energy prices soared, billpayers are braced for a colder period that could stretch their finances.",
      "And over the longer term, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight said high domestic energy prices were likely to be \"the new normal\".",
      "Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the forecasts meant particularly families and people with disabilities faced \u201cimpossible choices\u201d.",
      "\"For bills to remain at this high level... and with an expectation that they'll remain at that level for the foreseeable future, we're just expecting to see people continuing to be really squeezed.\"",
      "The cap means a household bill will typically rise by \u00a31.75 a month.",
      "It is also 10% down on the same period last year, but Ofgem said many billpayers would still be stretched.",
      "\"We understand that the cost of energy remains a challenge for too many households,\" said Tim Jarvis, from the regulator.",
      "\"However, with more tariffs coming into the market, there are ways for customers to bring their bill down so please shop around and look at all the options.\"",
      "What is happening to the energy price cap?",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "What are cold weather payments and who can get them?",
      "Debt building up",
      "While the cost of each unit of gas and electricity is capped, the total bill is not. So, a long, cold winter could see higher energy use and high bills.",
      "Energy companies say they have put extra support in place to help customers cope with the situation, such as emergency credit, hardship funds or striking off some debts or standing charges.",
      "However a period of high prices - which analysts say is likely to continue - means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.7bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",

      "It is set every three months by Ofgem, although the regulator illustrates the change by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "To estimate the effect on an individual's annual costs, billpayers can add 1.2% to their current bill.",
      "Some households will have less support than last winter because the final cost-of-living payment was made to eight million people on means-tested benefits in February.",
      "For pensioners, the previously universal winter fuel payment, worth up to \u00a3300, is now only being paid only to those on low incomes who receive certain benefits.",
      "According to the government's own estimates, an additional 50,000 pensioners will be living in relative poverty next year as a result of cuts to the payment.",
      "However, this fails to take into account any increased uptake of pension credit - which qualifies people for the winter fuel payment.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the UK was \"exposed to the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel markets\", which was why the government was concentrating on generating power in the UK.",
      "He admitted the latest price rise would \"concern\" many families.",

      "Government borrowing was much higher than expected in October, as debt interest payments hit a record high for the month and public sector pay rises contributed to higher spending.",
      "Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax take - stood at \u00a317.4bn last month, the second highest October figure since monthly records began in 1993.",
      "The borrowing figures are the first to be released since Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Budget last month, which outlined higher spending and increased taxes.",
      "However, analysts said the worse-than-expected borrowing figure underlined the difficulties the chancellor faced in keeping public finances under control.",
      "The borrowing figures are the latest piece of challenging data for the government.",
      "Inflation figures released on Wednesday showed prices rising faster than expected, while last week it emerged that the economy barely grew between July and September.",
      "In addition, the chancellor has come under pressure from businesses and the farming community to reverse some of the tax increases announced in the Budget.",
      "Questions have also been raised over Reeves' CV, following claims she had embellished some of her past achievements.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which produced the figures, said government revenue had risen last month, despite the cut in National Insurance rates earlier in 2024.",
      "\"However, with spending on public services, benefits and debt interest costs all up on last year, expenditure rose faster than revenue overall,\" said Jessica Barnaby of the ONS.",
      "Interest payments on government debt hit \u00a39.1bn last month, the highest October figure since monthly records began in 1997.",
      "The ONS figures also showed government spending on pay was up \u00a32.2bn from a year earlier, reflecting some of the impact of the latest public sector pay deals.",
      "When Labour came to power it announced above-inflation backdated pay increases for NHS staff and teachers, and these came into effect in October.",

      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said Labour had inherited a difficult economic situation following the election, and the Budget was aimed at \"fixing the foundations and putting public finances on a sustainable footing\".",
      "\"This government will never play fast and loose with the public finances. Our new robust fiscal rules will deliver stability by getting debt down while prioritising investment to deliver growth.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the scale of borrowing last month was \"a direct result of Labour\u2019s decision to hand out inflation busting pay rises to their union paymasters without any reforms in return\".",

      "This amount is 97.5% of the size of the UK's economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.",
      "At the Budget, Reeves changed the government's public finance rules, which will see it track a wider measure of debt to give it more scope to borrow for investment.",
      "This new measure of debt - public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) -  was at  83.7% of GDP in October, the ONS said.",

      "The reformed Pistols' shows raised money to help save Cook's local venue in London which was facing closure.",
      "\"Bigger bands shouldn't forget how they came through and if they can help out in some way, they should,\" said Matlock. \"We helped Shepherd's Bush Hall, and it led to the Sex Pistols reforming properly.\"",
      "In the late 1970s the Pistols, as the figureheads of the punk movement, were seen by many as public enemy number one, with their assaults on the music industry, the monarchy - and pretty much everything else.",

      "\"Whoever changes what is already there is the 'agent of the change' and has to deal with the consequences. Something needed to be done because it was closing down venues around the country.",

      "\"When I got home and got [phone] reception again, he'd sent me a draft white paper. We had a meeting and he invited me to the House of Commons.\"",
      "Brennan had already backed changes to planning laws to safeguard venues, including a campaign to protect those in Womanby Street in Cardiff.",
      "Brennan said: \"This was an issue I was interested in, so I went over, then realised who it was. I was a big fan of the Sex Pistols and The Clash.",
      "\"Quite a few politicians are into music and a lot of musicians are interested in politics. If people like Bono and Bob Geldof can get involved in politics, why can't politicians get involved with music?",
      "\"The Music Venues Trust tries to prevent the unnecessary closure of grassroots music venues. They come under pressure for all sorts of reasons: bad landlords, complaints about noise or other issues.",
      "\"We did this through a private member's bill in Westminster: The Agent of Change Bill had cross-party support and passed into law.",
      "\"So the principle has been established. But it doesn't mean there aren't still other pressures on venues, from issues like planning to financial viability rates.\"",
      "However, perhaps their friendship was not so unlikely. Brennan, who stood down as an MP in July after 23 years, played in what he called the world's first parliamentary rock band, MP4, and wrote and recorded his own songs.",
      "\"It transpired that Kevin was an accomplished folk musician,\" said Matlock. \"He told me about recording his album and I said 'I can put some bass on it if you like'.\"",
      "Brennan said: \"So I ended up making my little indie folk album The Clown and the Cigarette Girl with a Sex Pistol on bass.",
      "\"We did a launch in Cardiff, a big surprise for the crowd of 150 to see a punk legend at St John's Church in Canton. Then the next night he played with Blondie in front of a few thousand people [in Cardiff].",
      "\"He's a musician\u2019s musician - he just loves to play.",
      "\"I never thought when I became a MP I'd end up playing in a band with a Sex Pistol. Funny how things turn out!\"",
      "Matlock praised Brennan as a \"very good folk musician\" and \"one of the few people in Parliament\" who had talked about the effects of Brexit on touring musicians.",
      "The Pistols' bassist said there was now \"a realisation Brexit hasn't been good for touring musicians. There's been a huge knock-on effect, not just for musicians, but for trucking companies, catering workers, lighting guys. There has to be a better way through it.",
      "\"People like [The Who singer] Roger Daltrey and Johnny Rotten were pro-Brexit. But when they realised it would affect them they signed a petition to try to say we've got to have special rights.\"",
      "He added: \"I haven't spoken to John directly about this, but he knows what I think.\u201d",
      "For his part, Daltrey said in 2021 that he still supported Brexit, but wished the Conservative government at the time had \"made the easing of restrictions for musicians and actors a higher priority\".",
      "On his latest tour, Matlock is purposely picking venues in smaller towns that do not often feature on tour schedules.",
      "So he plays The Tivoli in Buckley, Flintshire, on Thursday, 21 November, and Clwb Crown in Merthyr on Friday 29 November.",
      "The Merthyr date brings flashbacks to a gig the Pistols played a few miles away in Caerphilly almost 48 years ago at the height of their notoriety.",
      "In December 1976 the band had just sworn on teatime TV and many shows on their Anarchy in the UK tour were banned. But although the Caerphilly gig went ahead, they were met by a large group of singing Christians, who picketed fans as they went in, which featured in the Pistols' film The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
      "Matlock said: \"The show was rescheduled from the Anarchy tour. Things got big in the meantime, we went back a few weeks later and there were people saying we were calling up the devil and kids would go to hell if they went to the gig.",
      "\"It was cold and pouring with rain, we were inside and they were all out getting wet. One of the local councillors in more recent years admitted it was all a bit daft, really. Good publicity at the time, though.\"",
      "By next year, Matlock will have been performing live for 50 years, and has no intention of slowing down. He has played with bands like Blondie, The Faces, and Primal Scream as well as the recently reformed Pistols, has written two books about his life in music, and his latest solo LP is Consequences Coming.",
      "He said: \"I still write protest songs. I think consequences have been coming for a long time for some our more self-centred politicians. I still have so much to say.\"",
      "Matlock added: \"I never used to think past the end of the week when I was a teenager. But collectively with the Sex Pistols we really had something.",

    "story": [
      "John Prescott was an old-style political bruiser who played a vital role in the New Labour project.",
      "He scorned what he called \"the beautiful people\" - the men in smart suits with red roses and mobile phones who became the new face of Labour.",
      "Yet he was an important figure in the campaign to sell modernisation to the party and pave the way for Labour to regain power after 18 years in opposition with Tony Blair's historic landslide victory in 1997.",
      "Towards the end of his political career, a series of embarrassments - including an affair and allegations of ministerial impropriety - threatened to tarnish his salt-of-the-earth image.",
      "But as deputy prime minister for 10 years and part of the team that won three successive election victories, his position in Labour history is secure.",

      "Watch: Moment Prescott punched protester who threw egg at him",
      "'You\u2019ve got a voice kid, use it' - how John Prescott inspired Angela Rayner",
      "No one was quite like John Prescott, says Blair",
      "Ship's steward",
      "John Leslie Prescott was born in Prestatyn, then in Flintshire, on 31 May 1938. His father was a railway signalman and his mother came from a mining family.",
      "Although his family left Wales when he was four, he remained proud of his heritage and always considered himself Welsh.",
      "He became a trainee chef on leaving school at 15 and then worked for eight years as a ship's steward on passenger liners, becoming active in the National Union of Seamen.",
      "In 1962, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he got a diploma in economics and politics, and later to Hull University to study for an economics degree.",
      "Active in the merchant sailors' strike of 1966, he served as an official with the National Union of Seamen for two years before his election, in 1970, as MP for Hull East, sponsored by the union.",
      "Cherished principles",
      "John Prescott became a Labour frontbench spokesman in May 1979 and joined the shadow cabinet in 1983, gaining a reputation as a pugnacious and knowledgeable spokesman on transport.",
      "The same year his showman's instincts saw him swim two miles down the River Thames to highlight opposition to Margaret Thatcher's government policy of dumping nuclear waste at sea.",
      "But it was the Labour leader John Smith who finally gave John Prescott political room to breathe, with a key role in selling modernisation to the party and unions.",
      "It was John Smith who kick-started Labour's slow return to power, overturning many of the party's most cherished principles in a drive to make it electable again.",
      "And John Prescott, with his strong union links and no-nonsense approach, offered vital support, not least in the abolition of the union block vote that had been Labour policy for years.",
      "When Tony Blair became leader, following John Smith's untimely death in 1994, he too recognised the importance of keeping John Prescott on board.",
      "The Hull East MP became deputy leader and later deputy prime minister with wide departmental responsibility over transport and the environment.",
      "He pledged to create an integrated transport system and said his success would be measured by a reduction in people needing to use a car.",
      "This caused him considerable embarrassment when, at the 1999 Labour conference, he used his ministerial car - a Jaguar - for a 200-yard journey back to his hotel.",
      "In typical Prescott style, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline's hair would not get blown about.",
      "But the politician, who also owned a Jaguar himself, was soon dubbed \"two Jags\" in the press.",
      "He once described himself as the guard on the Labour train - ready to slow it down if it moved off the rails. Yet his solid working-class credentials added powerful support to Tony Blair and the Labour modernisers.",
      "He campaigned passionately against the Conservative policy of privatising Britain's railways and was reported to have been furious when Labour failed to adopt a policy of renationalisation when returned to power.",
      "Election punch",
      "His policy of creating elected regional assemblies to oversee the new regional development agencies also hit the buffers, when, in a referendum in a pilot area in England's North East, 78% of people rejected the idea.",
      "He also faced opposition over his so-called Pathfinder project, designed to provide thousands of new homes.",
      "As part of the policy, about 200,000 homes in the North of England were demolished, which, critics said, could have been renovated at much less cost.",
      "His passion and burly style of delivery were constant features.",
      "He repeatedly described New Labour's mission as delivering \"traditional values in a modern setting\" - a powerful if somewhat intangible concept.",
      "Mocked by some for mangling his syntax, he often still managed to inject humour into difficult situations - such as when he was criticised for accusing a female French minister of being too tired to understand the intricacies of an environment summit.",
      "\"As to whether I am accused of being a macho man - moi?\" he told the Commons. \"I must say the remark leaves me most gutted.\"",
      "He hit the headlines during the 2001 general election after he was filmed throwing a punch at a member of the public who had thrown an egg at him during a protest in Rhyl, Flintshire.",
      "John Prescott said he had acted in self-defence and police refused to take any further action. Subsequent newspaper polls suggested most people supported his reaction.",
      "Oyster bar",
      "In later days, John Prescott reportedly had to act as a peacemaker between Tony Blair and the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, as speculation about the succession to the leadership ebbed and flowed.",
      "His own comment in a newspaper, that the \"tectonic plates\" in the Labour Party were moving, gave rise to suggestions of manoeuvring within the cabinet.",
      "And when he was seen sharing a car with Gordon Brown and stopping off at a Scottish oyster bar, the rumours that Tony Blair was about to stand down intensified.",
      "However, as his career as an MP neared its end, the headlines surrounding John Prescott concentrated on his private life.",
      "In 2006, he admitted to an affair with his former secretary Tracey Temple, which led to a raft of lurid stories.",
      "In a cabinet reshuffle soon after the revelations emerged, John Prescott was stripped of his department, although kept on as deputy prime minister and allowed to retain his salary and grace-and-favour homes.",
      "But, in a further embarrassment, he felt compelled to give up his country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on its lawns playing croquet with his staff - an image at odds with his down-to-earth reputation.",
      "It was later revealed he had visited the US ranch of businessman Philip Anschutz - whose company took over the running of the Millennium Dome and who was bidding to build Britain's first super-casino.",
      "Critics said there was a conflict of interest. John Prescott, who met Mr Anschutz seven times, failed to declare the visit for 11 months. He eventually said he had gone because he liked cowboy films.",
      "The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee ruled the ministerial code had been broken because the trip had not been declared immediately.",
      "Lording it",
      "Shortly after Tony Blair said he would be stepping down as prime minister, John Prescott announced he would relinquish his role as deputy.",
      "He ended his time in government with no ministerial brief of his own and was seen by many as a peripheral figure.",
      "To the surprise of many of his supporters, he accepted a peerage in 2010 despite reportedly having once said: \"I don't want to be a member of the House of Lords. I will not accept it.\"",
      "He defended the decision because it would give him continued influence over environmental policy and he refused to treat the red benches as an upmarket retirement home, using them as a platform to carry on campaigning.",
      "He continued to serve in the Lords until July of this year, when he was removed for non-attendance - bringing down the curtain on a parliamentary career of more than 50 years.",
      "His most robust interventions in Lords debates involved attacking the government's response to the phone-hacking scandal.",
      "For Lord Prescott, the matter was personal - his lawyers alleged the News of the World had placed him under surveillance, and in 2012 he won a pay out from the paper's parent company, News International.",
      "He was back on the stump again in 2012 when he stood as a candidate in Humberside in the elections for the new office of police and crime commissioner.",
      "He was said to be disappointed when he lost out to a Conservative opponent on the second round of balloting.",
      "Party loyalist",
      "John Prescott remained a Labour loyalist at heart.",
      "While ultimately distancing himself from Tony Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq, he defended his former boss' legacy and was equally supportive of the different leaders that followed him.",
      "He also advised the then-Labour leader Ed Miliband in the run up to the 2015 election.",
      "He was far from a natural bedfellow of Jeremy Corbyn but insisted the left-wing campaigner - who opposed nearly all of what New Labour stood for - had \"proved himself\", and urged dissident MPs to support him.",
      "His son David - who himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament - was even part of Jeremy Corbyn's team.",
      "And speaking at Labour's 2017 conference - the 51st he had attended - he said the party was on the path back to government and had a \"really exciting\" future.",
      "In 2019, he suffered a stroke and was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. But his former Labour colleague, Alan Johnson, said there were \"no signs of him slowing down at all\".",
      "To the very end, he represented a breed apart from many of his contemporaries - a Labour MP who had cut his campaigning teeth in a trades union rather than as a political adviser and who believed political principles had to be married to power.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 13:23:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Keir Starmer says it is his personal mission to defeat the people-smuggling gangs",
    "story": [
      "On a spring day, Hamid Khoshsiar decided to make the perilous journey into the European Union. He was 31 at the time, an Iranian refugee who had been living in Turkey for two years. But in 2019, he felt it was time to go.",
      "Starting out in Igneada, in the north of the country, he walked along a slippery, uneven trail for half a day, through dense forest and sharp shrubbery in the direction of Bulgaria. Eventually he reached the border.",
      "His best option, he decided, was to swim across a small river. The waters were mercifully calm. Packing his scant belongings into plastic bags, he waded in.",
      "\u201cThere was so much adrenaline in my blood,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe only thing that was important to me was safety. All my mind was about that: am I going to find safety or not?\u201d",
      "It would take him 20 hours to reach safety in Bulgaria, where he now lives with refugee status. As for the journey, he says he could have died from dehydration had he not been found by a police patrol. Still, it was the best decision of his life.",
      "\u201cIt was worth it because I didn\u2019t have any other option. I was so lucky.\u201d",
      "Over the past five years, more and more migrants have decided to try their luck following the same path, known as the Eastern Mediterranean route. It starts in Turkey and moves into either Bulgaria or Greece; and then, for many, deeper in Europe.",
      "Whilst other routes - like the path from the north African coast to Italy - have seen a fall, the numbers entering Europe via this Eastern Mediterranean route tripled between 2021 and 2023 and is still rising, according to EU border agency Frontex.",
      "It now stands at well over 60,000 a year. Many are Afghan and a number are Turkish and Syrian. Some, eventually, end up on the shores of Britain.",
      "Since taking power, the Labour government has repeatedly promised to \u201csmash\u201d the smuggling gangs who lead them here.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s strategy focuses heavily on policing. He has promised to treat smugglers like terrorists, disrupting their plans \u201cbefore they act\u201d. On 4 November, the prime minister announced plans to create a new Border Security Command, which the government say will have enhanced powers to trace suspected traffickers and shut down their bank accounts. One hundred additional specialist investigators will be assigned to the National Crime Agency (NCA), one of the UK bodies tasked with cracking down on people smugglers, while the Crown Prosecution Service will deliver charging decisions more quickly in international organised crime cases.",
      "But is it enough? After all, the Conservatives had their own version of Labour\u2019s slogan, promising to \u201cstop the boats\u201d - and yet in the year to June 2024, some 38,784 irregular arrivals were detected - 81% of them arrived in small boats.",
      "So what makes Labour think it will fare differently, and that its police-first strategy will work?",
      "The Today Podcast",
      "Special report: Europe\u2019s frontline against illegal migration",
      "Can you smash the gangs to stop the boats?",
      "Over the last week, as part of a series on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, we traced the path of migrants from Turkey to Bulgaria to the rest of Europe - the \u201cbiggest growth route\u201d for those travelling into Europe, according to the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory - in search of what it will really take to \u201csmash the gangs\u201d.",
      "When we talk about smuggling gangs, we tend to focus on the end of the process, such as the UK's relations with France, and on the movement of people across the English Channel, but our route marks the start of the journey: it\u2019s where migrants first enter Europe.",
      "Along the way,  we spoke to migrants who shared their complicated reasons for putting their lives in the hands of people smugglers. What soon became clear was the sheer magnitude of the government\u2019s task.",
      "Gateway to Europe: the Turkey challenge",
      "The crowded shopping bazaar in the Istanbul district of Esenyurt is popular with the thousands of Syrian refugees who live in the region. \u201cYou can see Syrian shops here,\u201d Husam, a Syrian refugee, told us as he showed us around after Friday prayers. \u201cMany were not here in 2015. You have falafel, shawarma - many shops for Syrian food. It was a comfortable, safe place for Syrians.\u201d But now the mood is darkening.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years it\u2019s not safe any more,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere are groups of racist people who don\u2019t like refugees. On public transportation you cannot speak comfortably in Arabic on your phone. People are attacked [for] speaking Arabic.\u201d",
      "Turkey has more refugees than any other country. It opened its borders to people fleeing the war in Syria in 2011; now there are upwards of three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, according to the UN. But Turks are getting restless. President Recep Erdogan has urged refugees - who he calls \u201cguests\u201d - to go home.",
      "Migrants without papers are being arrested and deported. Even those who have papers face being harassed, and now many who made temporary homes in Turkey want to leave - legally if possible - but, where necessary, they use people smugglers.",
      "All of this is being watched by Westminster. With so many people so desperate to move westwards, one of the British Government\u2019s prime tasks, if it is to keep its promise to reduce illegal arrivals, is to start cracking Turkey\u2019s people-smuggling model. And that starts with social media.",
      "For years, smugglers have used Facebook and other platforms to advertise safe passage between countries, often including prices and package deals such as \u201ckids go free\u201d.",
      "Over a traditional Syrian meat-and-rice dish of maqluba, Ali, a former footballer from Damascus, gets out his phone and shows us social media videos that promote smuggling routes. They are slick and professional, with pictures of boats and people looking joyous as they arrive in Greece.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely I\u2019m thinking about leaving,\u201d Ali admits. \u201cNot just me, all my friends.\u201d",
      "Britain is one of the destinations he has in mind, along with the Netherlands and Germany.",
      "Stemming the flow from Turkey",
      "The exodus from Turkey is not surprising, says Marc Pierini, EU ambassador to Turkey between 2006 and 2011. \u201cSyrian refugees in Turkey have over the past few years become the scapegoat\u2026 A whole xenophobic narrative has been [created] by the authorities.\u201d",
      "Turkey\u2019s poor economy is only adding to the problem, argues Murat Erdo\u011fan, a professor of migration studies at Ankara University, who is no relation to the president. Interest rates were raised to 40% last year amid soaring inflation.",
      "For years, successive European governments have attempted to crack down on the smuggling ring here by giving money and logistical support to Turkish police and coastguard. A 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey - in which Turkey was given aid in return for its help reducing the flow of migrants travelling to Greece on boats - was an early attempt to undermine the smuggling business model.",
      "But Rob Jones, director of operations at the NCA, says cracking down on the trade is complex - and even more difficult than policing the movement of illegal drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s more organic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt relies on a series of informal trusted relationships\u201d.",
      "Smuggling gangs often use hawala - a payment method that avoids formal banking and instead relies on a network of agents to deliver cash across borders. \u201cThat means we don\u2019t have large amounts of cash moving between borders or even electronically, like we do with the drug trade,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also difficult because it utilises ubiquitous social media apps which allow people to be handed between groups at ease. \u201c",
      "In Britain, ministers of successive governments have recognised this as part of the problem, as well as the need to tackle social media advertising. Since 2021, the NCA has worked with Meta, X, TikTok and YouTube to remove posts promoting smuggling services. By this summer, 12,000 posts had been deleted, the agency said.",
      "The newly appointed Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, has told us: \u201cWe will keep chipping away and undermining their business to the point where that is no longer viable and profitable.\u201d",
      "But our experience in Turkey showed us that - to date - it\u2019s still possible to connect with a smuggler at the click of a button.",
      "Crackdown at the border",
      "The NCA has highlighted a particular area that is a \u201ccrucible\u201d for organised immigration crime: the crossing between Turkey and Bulgaria, which marks the EU\u2019s external frontier.",
      "We visited the tiny Bulgarian mountain village of Shtit, a sleepy place with dirt roads and rusting farm machinery - a place that doesn\u2019t seem to hold much geopolitical significance, but that\u2019s right at the border, which is marked by a 4m high fence and razor wire.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sharp and it\u2019s almost impossible to climb with bare hands,\u201d says Hamid, the Iranian refugee who crossed it in 2019. \u201cUsually they\u2019re using ladders, but there\u2019s some places [along the fence] that they\u2019ve already cut.\u201d",
      "Our conversation is interrupted by a passing patrol car. Two uniformed officers warn us not to take photographs of the border; presumably, if shared on social media they can help migrants make the crossing.",
      "Nikolai, a chef in a local restaurant, tells us he has seen a marked increase in security in the area - many of the guards are from Germany and Poland, and are working in Bulgaria as part of the EU\u2019s border force, Frontex.",
      "Certainly, the Bulgarians have made strides in policing their side of the border. In recent years they have installed cameras, drones, and ramped up the number of security staff.",
      "This ring-of-steel-style system has had some success: the number of migrants crossing here has fallen in the last two years, says Atanas Rusev, director of the Security Programme at the Centre for Study of Democracy. But there are gaps.",
      "The porousness of the border is apparent about 32km down the road, at the Kapitan Andreevo crossing, uniting Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey - the busiest such border in Europe. The terrain is mountainous, with parts covered by thick forests making it easy for migrants to go undetected.",
      "\u201cIn order to police you need thousands of people on the ground,\u201d Mr Rusev explains. \u201cYou cannot put a man every five metres - so you have these patrols that are moving across certain sections of the border. Then you have the fence, but the fence is not a big obstacle because you need a simple wooden ladder.\u201d",
      "The smuggling gangs are clever and \u201cknow the terrain very well\u201d, he explains. \u201cIf you think that you can stop these irregular flows just with policing and prosecution and securitising, it\u2019s a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "Fines for carrying inflatable boats",
      "And they\u2019re not just trying to stop people. Many of the rubber inflatable boats used to smuggle migrants across the Channel are manufactured in Turkey and transported over this very border.",
      "One difficulty stopping the boats is that it is legal to carry inflatables across Europe; they might be used for a fishing trip.  But following talks with the UK, the Bulgarians have changed their customs regulations to say that only certain Turkish companies are licensed to export boats.",
      "Anyone found with an unlicensed vessel in the back of their car can face a \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,666) euro fine. To help detect those boats is a dog, Adele, trained by the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency to sniff out rubber. Her harness carries both Bulgarian and UK flags.",
      "I point out to Valerie, the border agent showing us around, that smuggling gangs can make thousands of pounds of profit off each passenger. Perhaps the gangs are happy to risk a \u20ac2,000 fine?",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d comes the answer, \u201cbut we stop some.\u201d",
      "So where does this leave Britain?",
      "Back in Britain, the prime minister has suggested that policing, intelligence and more international cooperation is the answer. Our experience in Bulgaria of the attempt to disrupt the trade in boats being exported from Turkey highlights the benefits of this approach and also its limitations. Even with drones, cameras and security staff, thousands of people stream into the country illegally every year. It's certainly not a promising sign.",
      "And yet the government\u2019s heavy focus on policing and security has paid off in some ways. Earlier this month, Amanj Hasan Zada, who organised cross-Channel smuggling from his home in Lancashire and was feted as \u201cthe best smuggler\u201d, was convicted and given a 17-year sentence.",
      "Why so many prime ministers have failed to cut migration",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "Peter Walsh, head of the Migration Observatory, is more optimistic than some about Labour\u2019s beefed-up security approach, pointing out that it\u2019s possible to reduce the flow of people. But he stresses that the success or failure ultimately depends on global trends in people smuggling, over which UK ministers have little control.",
      "He also fears police might end up in a game of whack-a-mole. \u201cThe people most directly involved in smuggling activity can [be] apprehended - but they can quickly be replaced.\u201d",
      "Which poses a new question. As he puts it: can you apprehend people more quickly than they can be replaced?",
      "Alternative routes",
      "There are alternative strategies to police-first - but each is loaded with its own problems. For example, by giving money to countries such as Syria, it\u2019s possible to tackle what are termed the \u201croot causes\u201d of migration so there\u2019s less need for refugees to flee. The prime minister made a gesture to this strategy in the summer, pledging \u00a384m for education and employment opportunities in Africa and Middle East. But even the most optimistic of humanitarians don\u2019t think this is a solution in the short- or even medium-term, or that \u00a384m is enough to fix the problems.",
      "Then there\u2019s the prospect of bilateral deals. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for the UK would be to strike a generous beach-returns deal with France, says Mr Walsh, in which France agrees to take back migrants who arrive via the Channel and intercept boats. \u201cBut what\u2019s in it for France?\u201d Mr Walsh asks.",
      "Finally there\u2019s the option of offering \u201csafe and legal\u201d routes for refugees to enter Britain, the policy preferred by some charities. But other experts suggest this would amount only to a few thousand people per year - and attempt to seriously ramp up numbers may become politically toxic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be more people that want to arrive than can arrive,\u201c added Mr Walsh. And those people will make it through any means necessary.",
      "Of everything we saw in Turkey and Bulgaria, one memory stays with me that proves this very point. It was at the Harmanli refugee camp, the largest in Bulgaria. There, we met a group of 10 Syrian men who had recently made the crossing from Turkey. Their smugglers knew exactly where they could climb over the fence, they told us.",
      "But what about the hi-tech cameras, the drones, and the extra police, I asked? They just shrugged. It didn\u2019t seem like they\u2019d struggled.",
      "It impressed upon me the enormity of Labour\u2019s task. After all, ministers can throw whatever resources they want at the issue of gangs but if migrants are determined enough, and if the money for gangsters is tempting enough, some will always find a way through.",
      "Mr Walsh is also sceptical of whether people smuggling gangs can be cracked at scale, drawing the comparison of drugs gangs. \u201dThere\u2019s a fair amount of investment that goes into controlling the sale of illicit drugs, yet they continue,\u201d he argues. \u201cSo the idea that you can stamp it out entirely is just not feasible.",
      "\u201cYes you can make a difference, but it\u2019s impossible to reduce it to zero.\u201d",
      "No-one who works with migrants, no-one who works on border security, would ever say the sort of words or phrases routinely in political slogans: \u201cstop the boats\u201d or \u201csmash the gangs\u201d. What they talk about instead is a much more modest ambition of making it harder to cross borders without the right paperwork, reducing the number who do so and disrupting the people smugglers. But they all accept that those who really want to make it from one side of the border to the other will probably eventually succeed.",

    "title": "Chris Mason: What the farmers' protest tells us about their argument with the government",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Why has the inheritance tax for farmers argument got so noisy, so quickly?",
    "story": [
      "The farmers' demonstration was best summed up in two images: real tractors being driven by farmers around Parliament Square, and beside them a collection of toy tractors being pedalled around by their children.",
      "They illustrated the essence of the farmers\u2019 argument: there is a deep-seated cultural expectation that they will pass on their farm to the next generation.",
      "For many, it feels like a deep responsibility that stretches high into their family tree, and so the expectation falls upon them to ensure the very thing their forebears did for them they manage to as well \u2013 hand it down to their sons and daughters.",
      "As a reporter, I love covering protests and marches at Westminster.",
      "They are an essential megaphone in the never-ending conversation of our democracy.",
      "I have been turning up at them with a microphone and camera for 20 years \u2013 to witness and scrutinise those making the most of their much-cherished right to come to London and \u2013 often \u2013 shout at the government.",
      "I love them because people sufficiently passionate about their cause to trek to the capital and then make a public, almost certainly contentious, argument often deserve to be listened to and should be vigorously questioned too.",
      "And, for me, those conversations offer an insight into not just what those protesting think, but why they think it.",
      "This gathering of farmers left me with three thoughts:",
      "Firstly, as we have already explored, there is the huge power of the cultural expectation of handing on a farm to the next generation.",
      "It is not just a business, but an identity, a belonging, a geographical rootedness \u2013 and the prospect of not being able to pass it on generates huge anger and emotion.",
      "That is a big part of the explanation for why this argument has got so noisy, so quickly.",
      "Secondly, contested notions of fairness are so often central to the most contentious political arguments, and this one is no different.",
      "The government argues existing inheritance tax isn\u2019t fair or sustainable \u2013 as everyone else sufficiently well off to pay it is charged 40% and farmers are charged nothing.",
      "Ministers also argue the exemptions have tempted rich folk to buy up farm land \u2013 pushing up its value \u2013 primarily to avoid inheritance tax.",
      "And, as they are at pains to point out over and over again, they insist the vast majority of family farms will be unaffected and those that are will be charged 20%, half the rate charged to anyone else caught within its grasp.",
      "Plus, they say, schools and hospitals desperately need more money.",
      "Others say the farmers are a noisy, well-organised lobby group seeking to shield their often considerable wealth and perpetuate a privilege to the exclusion of others.",
      "And all this brings us to the third big question here: what does it mean to be rich?",
      "Talking to farmers, very quickly our conversation would often involve very big numbers - talk of assets running into a few million pounds.",
      "These are huge figures that point to considerable wealth and yet the farmers insist, for two reasons, they are not rich.",
      "Their annual income is often modest, they point out - and they don\u2019t value their farm in numerical terms, but in emotional ones. The prospect of selling it horrifies them; handing it on is what they seek to do.",
      "The farmers insist they are determined to press on with their campaign.",
      "Ministers insist they are determined to press on with their plans for change.",
      "You may choose to sympathise with the farmers\u2019 arguments or not \u2013 or the government\u2019s arguments, or not \u2013 but the protests offer an insight into what contributes to the view of many of the farmers, and why them backing down doesn\u2019t seem likely any time soon.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 14:13:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Fraught debate revealed the divide between rich and poor as the UN conference sealed a climate finance deal.",
    "story": [
      "COP29 is over, with developing countries complaining that the $300bn (about \u00a3240bn) a year in climate finance they will receive by 2035 is a \"paltry sum\".",
      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",
      "\u201cIt's a paltry sum,\" India's delegate Chandni Raina told other delegates, after the deal had been gavelled through.",
      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",
      "Ultimately, the developing world was compelled to accept it, with many rich countries pointing to next year's arrival of President Donald Trump, a known climate sceptic, and arguing that they would not get a better deal.",
      "But this package is also being criticised as short-sighted from the richer world\u2019s perspective.",
      "The argument runs that if you want to keep the world safe from rising temperatures, then wealthier nations need to help emerging economies cut their emissions, because that is where 75% of the growth in emissions has occurred in the past decade.",
      "New national plans are due to be published next spring to outline how every country will limit their planet warming gases over the next 10 years.",
      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",
      "And at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and distraction, keeping countries united on climate should be critical. The big fight over money re-opened old divisions between rich and poor, with an anger and bitterness I have not seen in years.",
      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",
      "Azerbaijan, like the UAE, has an economy which is built on oil and gas exports, which seems at odds with a process that is meant to be helping the world transition away from coal, oil and gas.",
      "Privately, many senior negotiators spoke of their frustration with what some termed the worst COP in a decade. Half-way through the meeting, several senior climate leaders wrote a public letter saying COP was not fit for purpose and calling for reform.",
      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",
      "The natural successor is China.",
      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",
      "All in all, a move that is being seen as very deft and effective.",
      "\u201cChina is becoming more transparent about its financial support to global south countries,\u201d said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThis should propel the country to play a larger role in the future.\"",
      "'Trump-proofing' the climate",
      "Although he was not there, Trump\u2019s presence was felt across COP.",
      "One common element among the negotiators in Baku was the need to ensure that a second Trump administration would not upend years of careful climate negotiations.",
      "So it was no surprise to see that richer nations wanted to commit to raising funding by 2035. They believe putting that date will allow the US to contribute again once Trump has left office.",
      "Similarly, the drive to increase the contributor base was done with Trump in mind.",
      "Bringing China to the table, even in a voluntary capacity, will be used to show that it is worth engaging in international forums like COP.",
      "\"No-one thinks Trump in the White House will be anything but damaging to the multilateral climate regime,\" said Prof Michael Jacobs, visiting senior fellow at the think tank ODI Global.",
      "\"But this agreement was about trying to limit the damage as much as possible.\u201d",
      "Campaigners become more vocal",
      "One very noticeable trend at COP29 was the sometimes more aggressive stance taken by many environmental NGOs and campaigners.",
      "I witnessed it myself when US climate envoy John Podesta was chased out a meeting area with chants of \u201cshame\u201d ringing in his ears.",
      "Many developing countries rely on these NGOs for support in dealing with complex events like COP.",
      "During the talks, there was a strong push from many of these campaigners for an outright rejection of almost any deal.",
      "Similarly, in the final plenary when all countries accepted the finance text, there were brash cheers when speakers from several nations spoke out against the agreement, after the gavelling.",
      "Will confrontational activism and fraught debate become the new norm at a diplomatic climate conference?",
      "We will have to wait for the next COP to see.",
      "Climate deal too little too late, poorer nations say",

    "summary": "How future talks will play out if another superpower comes to the fore, just as the US steps back",
    "story": [
      "The WhatsApp message was from the chief negotiator of one of the most powerful countries at the COP climate gathering. Could I stop by for a chat, he asked.",
      "As his team hunched over computers eating takeaway pizza, he raged about the obstructionist behaviour of many of the other teams at the conference.",
      "So far, so normal. Others had been saying versions of this all week \u2013 that this was the worst COP ever; that negotiating texts, which are meant to get smaller as deadlines approached, were in fact ballooning; that COP in its current form might be dead in the water\u2026",
      "Looming over it all was the prospect of US president-elect Donald Trump withdrawing the US from the COP process when he takes office for a second time. He has called climate action a \u201cscam\u201d and, at his victory celebration in West Palm Beach earlier this month, vowed to boost US oil production beyond its current record levels, saying, \u201cWe have more liquid gold than any country in the world\u201d.",
      "But there was one positive: China.",
      "\u201cIt's the only bright spot in all of this is,\u201d the chief negotiator told me. Not only was its negotiating style markedly different to previous years, but he also observed that, as he puts it, \u201cChina could be stepping forward.\u201d",
      "Another sign that this may be the case came at the start of the conference, when China made public details of its climate funding. Traditionally, China has released minimal information about its climate policies and plans, so it came as a surprise when, for the first time, officials said they have paid developing countries more than $24 billion for climate action since 2016.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s serious money, almost nobody else is at that level,\u201d one COP insider told me.",
      "It is a \u201cnotable signal\u201d, says Li Shuo, a director of China Climate Hub, \u201cas it\u2019s the first time that the Chinese government has laid out a clear figure in terms of how much they have been providing.\u201d",
      "If these are indeed signs that China plans to take a more central role in the future, just as the US is stepping back, it would mark a tectonic shift in the COP process.",
      "How that tectonic shift could look",
      "Historically, Western countries \u2013 particularly the US and EU \u2013 have provided the momentum, cheered on by smaller climate-vulnerable nations. The difference in the way the talks play out if China steps forward will be marked.",
      "Jonathan Pershing, program director of environment at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, has been to every COP and understands better than most the behind-the-scenes bartering, bullying and brinkmanship that makes or breaks deals at summits. He says that China won\u2019t lead from the front, like the US and Europe.",
      "\u201cThey're more cautious players than that. It may be that they're leading with Chinese characteristics, which is what they might say themselves.\u201d",
      "Starmer will struggle to keep his \u2018smash the gangs\u2019 promise - as I saw firsthand",
      "Trump and Xi Jinping\u2019s \u2018loving\u2019 relationship has soured - can they rebuild it?",
      "'Anointed by God': The Christians who see Trump as their saviour",
      "(This echoes how Deng Xiaoping, president in the early 1980s, described his economic reforms, which catapulted the country\u2019s economic growth into double figures: \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d.)",
      "Pershing suggests that China is likely to help drive the COP process forward by discreetly intervening to unblock disputes. Most of this effort will take place behind closed doors, he believes, but is likely to include urging developing and developed countries to increase their ambition \u2013 and the flow of cash.",
      "However China may not be entirely helpful on some of the challenges that slow the process, such as instances when countries use COP as a stage to champion their own interests.",
      "One of the biggest blockers in Baku was said to be Saudi Arabia, which heads up a group of fossil fuel producing countries that want to slow the transition to renewables. As a big consumer of fossil fuels, China has often thrown its weight behind them in the past, such as by resisting the UK\u2019s effort to get agreement to phase out coal at COP26 in Glasgow.",
      "A new \"unusually cooperative\" style",
      "There have been some other occasions in this year's talks that indicate how China's approach is already shifting.",
      "In the past, it tended to focus on its own interests and as such, it played a dual role in these talks. Sometimes it has aligned with the US and Europe, for example on ambitious targets to boost renewable power or on the reduction of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. On other issues, meanwhile, it has slowed progress.",
      "One such example was COP15, held in Copenhagen in 2009. There had been high hopes that an agreement would be reached to commit countries to deep cuts in carbon emissions. But the conference nearly collapsed when China fought against US pressure to submit to a regime of international monitoring. The final non-binding deal was generally considered a failure.",
      "This year was different, the chief negotiator I spoke to said. He observed that China was being \u201cunusually cooperative\u201d across all the discussions.",
      "Other changes were observed too, some around China's presentation of its own economic status.",
      "It is classed as a developing country in the context of UN climate talks, despite being the world\u2019s second biggest economy, the result of a peculiarity in the COP rules. (This is linked to its economic status in 1992 when the talks process began.) It has also long resisted pressure from developed countries to change its status, meaning it doesn\u2019t have to contribute to the pot that rich countries have agreed to pay to poorer ones. Yet this year some experts noticed a change in the wording used by Chinese negotiators.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting is the language the Chinese used,\u201d says Professor Michael Jacobs, an expert on climate politics at Sheffield University.  \u201cThey described it as \u2018provided and mobilised\u2019 - that\u2019s the term developed countries use for their payments.\u201d",
      "Language matters at climate conferences. Negotiators can spend days discussing whether something \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d happen. So, the Chinese echoing the language of the rich world is significant, Prof Jacobs argues.",
      "\u201cThey used to calibrate everything against what the US did,\u201d he says. When Trump took office in 2016, China stood back from the talks in response. This time is different, according to Prof Jacobs.",
      "\u201cThis looks to me like a claim of leadership.\"",
      "What\u2019s in it for the East?",
      "None of this is driven by \"altruism\" on China\u2019s part,\u201d Prof Jacobs continues.",
      "According to Li Shuo, the shifting economics of renewables explains why China is likely to be a bigger player.",
      "\u201cThe green transformation is very much being led by China - not necessarily the government, but its private sector and companies\u201d. These companies lead the rest of the world by what Li Shuo says is a \u201cvery significant margin\u201d.",
      "Eight out of every ten solar panels are made in China, and it controls some two-thirds of wind turbine production. It is reckoned to produce at least three-quarters of the world\u2019s lithium batteries and more than 60% of the global market for electric vehicles.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that solar panels, EVs and batteries are the \u201cnew trio\u201d at the heart of the Chinese economy.",
      "It is the huge investments China has made in renewable technologies and the massive economies of scale that it has created that have also driven down renewable costs year after year - the challenge it faces now is finding new markets to sell it into.",
      "The developing world is where the demand is set to boom. These countries will account for two-thirds of the renewable market within 10 years, according to a recent report by a group of economists tasked by the UN with calculating the costs of the energy transition.",
      "Pakistan imported 13 gigawatts (GW) of solar panels in the first six months of this year alone, according to research by Bloomberg NEF. To put that in context, the UK has 17GW of installed solar.",
      "Shipping clean tech to emerging economies dovetails with another of China\u2019s policies: its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative,\u201d an effort to develop new trade routes, including roads, railways, ports and airports, to connect with the rest of the world.",
      "China has spent more than a trillion dollars on the project, according to the World Economic Forum. Last week, President Xi opened a new port on the coast of Peru.",
      "Which begins to explain why, as Prof Jacobs sees it, while the US may withdraw, China looks like it might be stepping up. \u201cIt now sees its best interest as encouraging other countries to also cut their emissions by using Chinese technologies and equipment.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, though, regardless of whether this plays, out, there is cause for hope, according to some well-placed observers. Camilla Born, who has been part of the UK\u2019s negotiating team and helped run COP26 in Glasgow, believes that the future talks will be determined by the new economics of energy, not the politics of meetings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about an idea of how to deal with climate change anymore,\u201d she argues. \u201cThis is about investments, about money - it\u2019s people\u2019s jobs, it\u2019s new technologies. The conversations are different.\u201d",
      "It is, after all, the biggest revolution in energy since the start of the industrial revolution. And regardless of which superpower takes the lead, or if the US is out of the game for four years, it\u2019s unlikely that anyone will want to miss out on such a vast market.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Nov 2024 01:22:23 GMT",
    "summary": "These caves were unexplored for thousands of years, protected by swirling mists and terrifying tales.",
    "story": [
      "The couple stands on the edge of the sheer limestone cliff.",
      "More than 100 metres (328ft) beneath them is a lost world of ancient forests, plants and animals. All they can see is leafy tree tops and hear is the echoes of cicadas and birds bouncing off the cliffs.",
      "For thousands of years, this \u201cheavenly pit\u201d or \u201ctiankeng\u201d, in Mandarin, was unexplored.",
      "People feared demons and ghosts hiding in the mists which swirled up from the depths.",
      "But drones and a few brave souls who lowered themselves into places untouched since dinosaurs roamed the Earth have revealed new treasures - and turned China\u2019s sinkholes into a tourist attraction.",
      "Two-thirds of the world\u2019s more than 300 sinkholes are in China, scattered throughout the country\u2019s west - with 30 known tiankeng, Guangxi province in the south has more of of them than anywhere else. Its biggest and most recent find was two years ago: an ancient forest with trees reaching as high as 40m (130ft). These cavities in the earth trap time, preserving unique, delicate ecosystems for centuries. Their discovery, however, has begun to draw tourists and developers, raising fears that these incredible, rare finds could be lost forever.",
      "Off the cliff",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never done this kind of thing before,\u201d says 25-year-old Rui, looking down into the chasm. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool. It will be the first time but not the last time.\u201d",
      "She takes a big breath. Then she and her boyfriend step back - off the edge and into the air.",
      "Fei Ge - the man who had just meticulously checked Rui and Michael\u2019s harnesses before sending them over the cliff - knows better than most the feeling of stepping back over the edge.",
      "He was one of the first explorers. Now in his 50s, he works as a tour guide helping people discover the secrets of Guangxi's sinkholes.",
      "Growing up in a village nearby, Fe had been told to stay away. \u201cWe thought that if humans went into the sinkholes, demons would bring strong winds and heavy rain. We thought ghosts brought the mist and fog.\u201d",
      "Fei Ge - or Brother Fei as he is known - was taught that these sinkholes have their own microclimate. The wind rushes through the tunnels and evaporated water from rivers inside the caves produces the mist.",
      "Eventually Brother Fei's curiosity won and he found a way into a sinkhole as a child.",
      "\u201cEvery tiny stone caused loud noises and echoes,\u201d he said. There was wind, rain and even \u201cmini tornadoes\u201d, he recalled. \u201cAt first, we were afraid.\u201d",
      "But he kept exploring. It was only when he brought scientists to the site that he realised how unique the sinkholes were.",
      "\u201cThe experts were astonished. They found new plants and told us they\u2019ve been doing research for decades and never seen these species. They were very excited. We couldn\u2019t believe that something we had taken for granted nearby was such a treasure.\u201d",
      "As scientists published their finds in journals, and word spread of their discovery, others came to study the sinkholes. Fei says explorers from the UK, France and Germany have come in the last 10 years.",
      "Sinkholes are rare. China - and Guangxi particularly - has so many because of the abundance of limestone. When an underground river slowly dissolves the surrounding limestone rock, it creates a cave that expands upwards towards the ground.",
      "Eventually, the ground collapses, leaving a yawning hole. Its depth and width must measure at least 100m for it to qualify as a sinkhole. Some, like the one found in Guangxi in 2022, are much bigger, stretching 300m into the earth and 150m wide.",
      "For scientists these cavernous pits are a journey back in time, to a place where they can study animals and plants they had thought extinct. They have also found species they had never seen or known, including types of wild orchid, ghostly white cave fish and various spiders and snails.",
      "Protected by sheer cliffs, jagged mountains and limestone caves, these plants and animals have thrived deep in the earth.",
      "Into the cave",
      "There is a delighted shriek as Rui dangles mid-air, before she starts rappelling down.",
      "This is just the start of the adventure for her and Michael. They have more ropework to do, in the belly of the cave.",
      "After a short walk through a maze of stalactites, Michael is lowered into the dark. The guides sweep the area with torches, illuminating the arc above us - a network of caves - and then shine the light into the narrow passages below, where a river once carved through the rock.",
      "That\u2019s where we are headed. The guides have to work hard to move the ropes into position.",
      "\u201cI am not a person that does much exercise,\u201d says Michael, his words echoing in the cave.",
      "This is the highlight of the Shanghai couple\u2019s two-week break in Guangxi, the kind of holiday they had craved during China\u2019s long Covid lockdowns. \u201cThis kind of tourism is more and more familiar on the Chinese internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw it and thought it looked pretty cool. That\u2019s why we wanted to try it.\u201d",
      "Videos of the Guangxi sinkholes have gone viral on social media. What is a fun and daring feat for young people is a source of much-needed revenue in a province that was only recently lifted out of poverty.",
      "There is little farmland in Guangxi\u2019s unusual but stunning terrain, and its mountainous borders make trade with the rest of China and neighbouring Vietnam difficult.",
      "Still, people come for the views. Pristine rivers and the soaring karst peaks of Guilin and Yangshuo in the north draw more than a million Chinese tourists each year. Photographs of mist-covered Guangxi have even made it onto the 20-yuan note.",
      "Yet few have heard of Ping'e village, the nearest settlement to the sinkholes. But that is changing.",
      "Brother Fei says says a steady stream of visitors is changing fortunes for some in Ping\u2019e. \u201cIt used to be very poor. We started developing tourism and it brought lots of benefits. Like when the highways were built. We were really happy knowing we have something so valuable here.\u201d",
      "But there are concerns that tourism revenue could override the demands of scientific research.",
      "About 50km from Ping\u2019e, developers have built what they say is the highest viewing platform, which overlooks Dashiwei, the second-deepest sinkhole in the world. Tourists can peer 500m down into this particular \u201cheavenly pit\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe should better protect such habitats,\u201d says Dr Lina Shen, a leading sinkhole researcher based in China. \u201cSinkholes are paradises for many rare and endangered plant species. We are continuing to make new discoveries.\u201d",
      "By studying sinkholes, scientists also hope to find out how the Earth has changed over tens of thousands of years, and better understand the impact of climate change. At least one sinkhole in Guangxi has already been closed to tourists to protect unique orchid varieties.",
      "\u201cOverdevelopment could cause tremendous damage. We should maintain their original ecological state,\u201d Dr Shen says, adding that the solution lies in striking a balance.",
      "\u201cHot air balloons, drones for aerial photography, and appropriate pathways for observation from a distance could allow tourists to closely yet remotely view sinkholes, while disturbing as few organisms as possible.\u201d",
      "Brother Fei doesn\u2019t disagree, and insists there are \u201cclear rules\u201d to protect the sinkholes and what they hold. To him, they are a prized find that has changed his life. He is now one of Guangxi\u2019s most qualified climbers and a renowned guide for both tourists and scientists, which has made him \u201cvery happy\u201d.",
      "As we walk through acres of lush forest inside the sinkhole, he points to a cliff above us. He tells us to return when the rains do to see the waterfalls that pour down the side. It\u2019s worth coming back for, he assures us.",
      "Rui and Michael are being roped up as they encourage each other to abseil further into the cave. All that is visible beneath them is a narrow chasm, lit up by a torch. It\u2019s all that remains of a river bed, the catalyst in making this sinkhole.",
      "\u201cWe need to balance this joy with protecting this place,\u201d Michael says, looking around him.",
      "He smiles as he is slowly lowered down and disappears into the cave."

    "title": "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:03:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries around the world are building new nuclear power stations.",
    "story": [
      "A decade ago, it seemed as though the global nuclear industry was in an irreversible decline.",
      "Concerns over safety, cost, and what to do with radioactive waste had sapped enthusiasm for a technology once seen as a revolutionary source of abundant cheap energy.",
      "Yet now there is widespread talk of a revival, fuelled by tech giants Microsoft, Google and Amazon all announcing investments in the sector, as well as the growing pressures on wealthy nations to curb their carbon emissions.",
      "But how real is the comeback?",
      "When commercial nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s, governments were seduced by its seemingly unlimited potential.",
      "Nuclear reactors could harness and control the same awesome forces released by atomic bombs - to provide electricity for millions of homes. With a single kilogram of uranium yielding some 20,000 times as much energy as a kilogram of coal, it seemed like the future.",
      "But the technology also inspired public fear. And that fear seemed to be justified by the Chernobyl disaster, which spread radioactive contamination across Europe in early 1986.",
      "It fuelled widespread public and political opposition \u2013 and slowed the growth of the industry.",
      "Another accident, at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan in 2011, re-energised concerns about nuclear safety. Japan itself shut down all of its reactors in the immediate aftermath, and only 12 have since restarted.",
      "Germany decided to phase out nuclear power altogether. Other countries scaled back plans to invest in new power plants, or extend the lives of ageing facilities.",
      "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, this led to the loss of 48GW of electric power generation globally between 2011 and 2020.",
      "But nuclear development did not stop. In China, for example, there were 13 nuclear reactors in 2011. There are now 55, with another 23 under construction.",
      "For Beijing, scrambling to meet rapidly growing electricity demand, nuclear had, and still has, a vital role to play.",
      "Now interest in the sector seems to be growing elsewhere once again. This is partly because developed countries are hunting for ways to meet energy demand, while striving to meet emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement.",
      "With 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record, the pressure to cut carbon emissions is mounting. A renewed focus on energy security, in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also been a factor.",
      "South Korea, for example, recently scrapped plans to phase out its large fleet of nuclear power stations over the next four decades \u2013 and will build more instead.",
      "And France has reversed plans to reduce its own reliance on nuclear energy, which provides 70% of its electricity. Instead, it wants to build up to eight new reactors.",
      "In addition, last week the US government reaffirmed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, or Cop29, held in Azerbaijan, that it intends to triple nuclear power generation by 2050.",
      "The White House had originally pledged to do this on the side lines of last year's conference, Cop28. A total of 31 countries have now agreed to try to triple their use of nuclear power by 2050, including the UK, France and Japan.",
      "Also at Cop29, which ends on Friday, 22 November, the US and UK announced that they would collaborate to speed up the development of new nuclear power technology.",
      "This came after it was agreed in the final statement or \u201cstocktake\u201d of last year's Cop28 that nuclear power should be one of the zero or low emission technologies to be \u201caccelerated\u201d to help combat climate change.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "But hunger for clean power is not just coming from governments. Technology giants are striving to develop more and more applications that use artificial intelligence.",
      "Yet AI relies on data \u2013 and data centres need constant, reliable electricity. According to Barclays Research, data centres account for 3.5% of electricity consumption in the US today, but that figure could rise to more than 9% by the end of the decade.",
      "In September, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal to buy power from Constellation Energy, which will lead to the reopening of the infamous Three Mile Island power station in Pennsylvania \u2013 the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, where a reactor suffered a partial meltdown in 1979.",
      "Despite its tainted public image, another reactor at the plant continued to generate electricity until 2019. Constellation\u2019s chief executive Joe Dominguez described the deal to reopen it as a \"powerful symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable energy resource\".",
      "Other tech giants have taken a different approach. Google plans to buy energy produced from a handful of so-called Small Modular Reactors or SMRs \u2013 a nascent technology intended to make nuclear energy easier and cheaper to deploy. Amazon is also supporting SMR development and construction.",
      "SMRs themselves are being promoted, in part, as a solution to one of the biggest drawbacks facing nuclear power today. In western nations, new power stations have to be built to exacting modern safety standards. This, cobined with their sheer scale, makes them prohibitively expensive and complicated to build.",
      "Hinkley Point C is a good example. Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station since the mid-1990s is being built on a stretch of remote coastline in southwest England.",
      "It is meant to be the first of a batch of new plants to replace the country\u2019s ageing reactor fleet. But the project is running some five years behind schedule and will cost up to \u00a39bn ($11.5bn) more than planned.",
      "It is not an isolated case. The US\u2019s newest reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia opened seven years late, and cost more than $35bn \u2013 well over double their original budget.",
      "SMRs are designed to solve this problem. They will be smaller than traditional reactors, using standardised parts that can be assembled quickly, at sites close to where the power is needed.",
      "But while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "Opinions about nuclear power remain highly polarised. Supporters claim the technology is indispensable if climate targets are to be reached. Among them is Rod Adams, whose Nucleation Capital fund promotes investment in nuclear technology.",
      "\u201cNuclear fission has a seven-decade history showing it is one of the safest power sources available,\" he explains.",
      "\u201cIt is a durable, reliable source of power with low ongoing costs already, but capital costs have been too high in Western countries.\"",
      "Opponents though, insist nuclear power is not the answer.",
      "According to Professor M.V. Ramana of the University of British Columbia, it is \u201ca folly to consider nuclear energy as clean\u201d.  It is, he says, \"one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity. Investing in cheaper low-carbon sources of energy will provide more emissions reductions per dollar.\"",
      "If current trends do herald a new nuclear age, one old problem remains. After 70 years of atomic power, there is still disagreement over what to do with the accumulated radioactive waste - some of which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years.",
      "The answer being pursued by many governments is geological disposal - burying the waste in sealed tunnels deep underground. But only one country, Finland, has actually built such a facility, while environmentalists and anti-nuclear campaigners argue that dumping waste out of sight and out of mind is simply too risky.",
      "Solving that conundrum may be a key factor in dictating whether there really will be a new age of nuclear power.",

    "summary": "Toxic, deadly, poisonous - these words are back in the headlines as Delhi\u2019s pollution spikes again.",
    "story": [
      "Winter has come to Delhi and with it, a familiar sense of gloom. The sky here is grey and there is a thick, visible blanket of smog.",
      "If you stay outdoors for more than a few minutes, you can almost taste ash. You will feel breathless within minutes if you try to run or even walk at a brisk pace in the smog.",
      "Newspapers are back to using words like \"toxic\", \"deadly\" and \"poisonous\" in their main headlines.",
      "Most schools have been shut and people have been advised to stay indoors - though those whose livelihoods depend on working outdoors can\u2019t afford to do so.",
      "Delhi\u2019s air quality score was somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 on Monday and Tuesday, according to different monitoring agencies. The acceptable limit is under than 100.",
      "These scores measure the levels of particulate matter - called PM 2.5 and PM10 - in the air. These tiny particles can enter the lungs and cause a host of diseases.",
      "On social media, people have been expressing shock, disappointment and anguish that it\u2019s all happening again.",
      "Along with the gloom, there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - like we have seen this all many times before in the past 15 years.",
      "I recorded this video of my drive to the office in 2017, when smog had reduced visibility to less than 2m.",
      "On Tuesday, my drive to the office seemed even worse.",
      "And we have covered every twist and turn of this story in the past two decades.",
      "We have reported how pollution is making people sick and reducing their life expectancy reducing their life expectancy.",
      "We have reported on India's Supreme Court ordering the government to take urgent steps to curb pollution every year. The court has done the same this year.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects children the most.",
      "We have written about how politicians blame each other for the problem every year.",
      "We have discussed the root cause of the problem.",
      "We have also talked about solutions - both the ones that marginally worked and the ones that failed miserably.",
      "We have reported on how pollution affects the poorest the most and how many don\u2019t have a choice but to go out and work in the smog.",
      "Covering this story feels like watching (and being in) the same dystopian film every year - following the same characters, plot and script. The outcome is always the same - nothing changes.",
      "The parks are empty again - people, particularly children and the elderly, have been told to stay indoors.",
      "Those who must work - daily-wage labourers, rickshaw pullers, delivery riders - are coughing but still going out.",
      "Hospitals are seeing an increasing number of people coming in with respiratory problems.",
      "And amid all this, we are back to the same question again - why does nothing change?",
      "The simple answer is that solving Delhi's air problem requires monumental efforts and co-ordination.",
      "The sources of the problem are many. One of them is the practice of farmers burning crop remains to clear their fields quickly to sow seeds for the next yield.",
      "This mostly happens in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The smoke from the farm fires engulfs Delhi every winter and hangs low in the atmosphere as wind speeds reduce during winter months.",
      "But farmers can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this because this is the cheapest way of clearing fields.",
      "Different governments have talked about providing machines and financial incentives to stop crop burning, but very little has happened on the ground.",
      "Delhi itself produces a huge chunk of the pollution - emission from vehicles, construction and factories.",
      "Every year, in the winter months, people get angry, journalists write and produce reports, politicians blame each other and courts fume - until we do it all over again the next year.",
      "A public health emergency like this would spark mass protests in most democracies. But the anger in Delhi is mostly limited to social media.",
      "Activists say the reason is that pollution doesn\u2019t cause immediate problems for most people. Ingesting high levels of PM2.5 causes health to deteriorate slowly. A Lancet study found that pollution led to more than 2.3 million premature deaths in India in 2019.",
      "And then there is the class divide. People who can afford to temporarily leave the city do that, those who can buy air purifiers do that, and those who can vent on social media do that.",
      "The rest, who don't have these options, just go about their lives.",
      "The collective angst has so far not resulted in a massive protest and, as the Supreme Court once observed, politicians just \u201cpass the buck\u201d and wait for the season to get over.",
      "Experts say governments at the federal level and in different states need to leave their party politics behind and work together to solve this problem. They need to focus on long-term solutions.",
      "And citizens need to hold politicians accountable and courts have to pass decisive orders months before the pollution worsens.",
      "This year, we are again in the thick of the season and temporary measures have been announced, like banning construction work.",
      "But can these bring Delhi's elusive blue skies back? The evidence from the past few years doesn\u2019t give much hope.",

    "story": [
      "An artificial intelligence (AI) tool which has been trained to tell the difference between grey and red squirrels could be \"an absolute game changer\", conservationists say.",
      "The system, called Squirrel Agent, has been trained on thousands of images of the animals allowing it to tell them apart with 97% accuracy, its developer says.",
      "It can then be used to automatically control access to squirrel feeders - with only reds being allowed into those containing food, and only greys into those where food has been replaced with contraceptive paste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real showcase of what AI can do,\u201d said Emma McClenaghan, co-founder of Genysys Engine, which developed the tool.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working in real time to do a task that we don\u2019t have enough [human] volunteers to do.\u201d",
      "Squirrel Agent is currently being tested in sites around the UK in conjunction with five wildlife charities.",
      "Genysys Engine hopes it will eventually be used much more widely not just with squirrels but with other species which would benefit from sophisticated digital monitoring.",
      "Ian Glendinning, from Northern Red Squirrels - one of the conservation groups involved in the trial - told the BBC that, for the animals he is trying to protect, help from technology was urgently needed.",
      "\u201cWe are in the bar of the last chance saloon, and the landlord has just called last orders,\" he said.",
      "Red peril",
      "Grey squirrels are largely responsible for the huge decline in the numbers of red squirrels.",
      "This is partly because there are so many of them, and also because they can carry a  virus which they have immunity to but is lethal to red squirrels. They arrived in the UK around 200 years ago.",
      "\u201cRed squirrels are hanging on in Scotland and Ireland, and there are some island populations like Anglesey and the Isle of Wight\", explained Mr Glendinning.",
      "\"But mainland England and Wales is in dire straits, and they will become extinct if we are unable to reverse this trend.\"",
      "Efforts to preserve red squirrels are further complicated by the fact that, despite their name, not all red squirrels are red.",
      "There are other markers including their tails, ears, size and weight which can also distinguish them from grey squirrels \u2013 the vastly dominant population - even if they are the same colour.",
      "The detection process is time-consuming for human observers - but Squirrel Agent uses the power of AI to rapidly analyse all those markers and decide with an extremely high level of accuracy which is which.",
      "It can then automatically decide whether to boost their survival chances by allowing them extra food - or reduce their likelihood of reproducing by steering them towards contraceptives.",
      "By a whisker",
      "Genysys Engine says the next step in the evolution of the tech is to go beyond just distinguishing between the types of squirrel and instead identify individual animals.",
      "This will be done, Emma McClenaghan says, by focusing on their whiskers, which are unique to each animal.",
      "\"Whiskers are like a human fingerprints,\" she says.",
      "By distinguishing between each creature\u2019s whisker tips, as well as their base and length, she hopes AI will enable wildlife experts to track and monitor individual members of the population.",
      "\u201cOver time this data will build up, allowing scientists and researchers to start tracking family lines,\u201d she says.",
      "There are already other examples of AI's ability to process huge amounts of data very quickly being useful for conservationists.",
      "For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) used the tech to analyse millions of photographs of a large area of Australia wiped out by bushfires, in order to find places where animals had survived.",

    "story": [
      "Jet engines are one of the most jaw-dropping feats of engineering humans have ever come up with.",
      "But jet engines shouldn\u2019t be possible, says Ben Beake, director of materials research at Micro Materials, an equipment testing company in Wales.",
      "\u201cThe air coming in is hotter than the melting point of the metal underneath \u2013 which is obviously not a good thing,\u201d he explains, pointing out that this air reaches temperatures well above 1,000C.",
      "Designers of jet engines have got around this problem by applying heat-resistant ceramic coatings to the engine blades. And now, researchers are developing yet stronger coatings that allow the engines to run hotter still.",
      "\u201cIf you get it to go hotter, then there\u2019s a massive saving on fuel and CO2,\u201d says Dr Beake. By increasing the temperature by just 30C or so, you might get an 8% fuel saving, he estimates.",
      "This is the power of coatings \u2013 they radically transform the functionality and capabilities of an underlying material. Few people realise how important they are, but these overlays and veneers can supercharge high-performance machines, or ensure that expensive equipment survives the harshest of environments.",
      "Dr Beake and his colleagues are tasked with pushing coatings to their limits, in order to see how robust or effective they really are. His clients don\u2019t always get the results they want. He recalls telling a missile manufacturer, \u201cWe\u2019ve broken your coating,\u201d some years ago. \u201cThey stormed off in a huff,\u201d says Dr Beake.",
      "Besides exposing coatings to high temperatures, Micro Materials also has a \u201cwoodpecker\u201d device, a tiny diamond stylus, which repeatedly taps a coating at random locations to test its durability.",
      "Recently, the firm has worked with UK-based Teer Coatings to test a product that could be applied to satellite components including gears and bearings used in various moving parts.",
      "It is a tricky task, says Xiaoling Zhang, from the company, because the coating must protect such components both pre-launch (when they are exposed to atmospheric humidity at ground level) and also in orbit, against dust particles and radiation in space. However, she claims that the firm has achieved the desired results.",
      "But besides protecting spacecraft, coatings could also stop astronauts from getting sick.",
      "Biofilms \u2013 gloopy accumulations of bacteria inside pipes \u2013 grow faster in low gravity environments, which could be a problem for water supplies or machinery that moves fluid around on space stations or future spacecraft, for example.",
      "\u201cBiofilms are known to cause mechanical failures,\u201d says Kripa Varanasi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d",
      "Prof Varanasi and his colleagues have developed a range of coatings that make surfaces slippery and therefore resistant to the formation of biofilms. Tests of one such coating in an experiment carried out on board the International Space Station found that it worked as intended.",
      "The idea behind the coating is to mix together a solid material and a lubricant. This is then sprayed onto the interior of a pipe or tube, which makes that inner surface extremely slippery.",
      "Prof Varanasi has previously made headlines for developing similar coatings for the insides of toothpaste packets \u2013 so you can get every last bit of toothpaste out. He and his colleagues have commercialised the technology through their spin-out company LiquiGlide.",
      "Slipperiness is, perhaps, an underappreciated attribute. Nuria Espallargas at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and colleagues have developed a silicon carbide-based coating for equipment used in aluminium manufacturing or repair.",
      "It is a sort of non-stick frying pan solution, meaning that layers of molten aluminium do not get stuck on this expensive equipment. The precise functioning of this particular coating is currently something of a mystery, though.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we really don\u2019t know how it works, the mechanism is unknown at the moment,\u201d says Prof Espallargas.",
      "Nonetheless, the coating is available commercially through her spin-out company Seram Coatings. Atlas Machine and Supply, a US firm that makes and repairs industrial machinery, has tried it out.",
      "\u201cThe real benefit lies in extending the life of the tools and improving the quality of the products being produced,\u201d says Jeremy Rydberg, chief innovation officer.",
      "He says that, without the coating, Atlas must rebuild the roller tools it uses to work aluminium every two days. This costs $4.5m annually. But the new coating means that these tools last for a whole week, not just a couple of days, slashing those rebuild costs to around $1.3m per year.",
      "Coatings can do some amazing things, but they don\u2019t always work as intended, notes Andy Hopkinson, managing director at Safinah Group, a firm that often gets called in to investigate when coatings go wrong.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of issues at the moment with car parks, where their passive fire protection system is peeling off,\u201d he says, referring to the fire-resistant paint sometimes applied to concrete structures.",
      "And his company has also found that coatings applied to commercial ships do not always prevent barnacles and other sea life from attaching themselves to the hull. This problem, known as biofouling, increases friction, meaning the ship\u2019s engine must work harder \u2013 and burn more fuel.",
      "Despite the availability of coatings that promise to help, ship owners do not always choose the correct one for their vessel. That choice should depend on where the ship is sailing, how long it is due to be idle rather than in motion, and so on, says Dr Hopkinson.",
      "The cost of fixing issues like this can run into many thousands, or even millions of pounds. \u201cTypically, paint costs between 1 and 2% of the project. The problem is, when it goes wrong, the costs become exponential,\u201d says Mr Hopkinson.",
      "The researchers working in this field, though, say that there are still many opportunities to improve coatings and develop new ones that could drastically improve the performance of machines or infrastructure in the future.",

      "If it hadn't been for the squirrels, George Matthew's attempt to become a cocoa bean producer might have failed.",
      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",
      "\"This complex process involves several stages and the activity of various micro-organisms, which help develop the beans' flavour, aroma, and colour,\" he says.",

      "From bean to bar: How chocolate is made",
      "To raise the quantity and quality of cocoa bean production, the government has introduced several initiatives.",
      "It is investing in schemes to develop hybrid cocoa plants, that are more productive than existing varieties.",
      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",
      "Business is also investing in new cocoa tree vareities.",
      "Dr Minimol J.S., is the head of cocoa research at Kerala Agriculture University and is working with Cadbury to develop hybrid cocoa trees.",
      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",
      "\"We are constantly focussing on improving the post-harvest practices for cocoa farmers in India,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Indian farmers need to be producing higher quality beans.",
      "\"We are not able to compete with international players in the bulk cocoa bean segment,\u201d he says.",
      "While there has been improvement, Indian producers have some way to go.",
      "\"Over the last decade, in the fine-flavour cocoa bean segment, India has started to get noticed... but it will be several years before all Indian fine flavour cocoa beans reach a stage of large-scale international recognition.\"",
      "Back in Kerala, Dr Matthew reflects on his decade as a cocoa farmer.",
      "\"It's a tricky plant,\" he says. \"Last year I had no yield. So no farmer can depend solely on cocoa - one has to plant other trees along with it.\"",

      "China and Russia are more bullish, the West weaker on the world stage.",
      "Wars burn in the Middle East and in Europe, with Donald Trump appearing less interested in bolstering European security.",

      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to give the tubing a miss\u201d two 27-year-old women from Hertfordshire in the UK tell me (they didn\u2019t want to give their names).",

I think if that happened in the UK you would definitely think it was dodgy.\u201d",

    "summary": "Scientists in the Caribbean are turning algae that have been choking beaches into biofuel.",
    "story": [
      "When large swathes of invasive seaweed started washing up on Caribbean beaches in 2011, local residents were perplexed.",
      "Soon, mounds of unsightly sargassum \u2013 carried by currents from the Sargasso Sea and linked to climate change \u2013 were carpeting the region\u2019s prized coastlines, repelling holidaymakers with the pungent stench emitted as it rots.",
      "Precisely how to tackle it was a dilemma of unprecedented proportions for the tiny tourism-reliant islands with limited resources.",
      "In 2018, Barbados\u2019 Prime Minister Mia Mottley declared sargassum a national emergency.",
      "Now, a pioneering group of Caribbean scientists and environmentalists hope to turn the tide on the problem by transforming the troublesome algae into a lucrative biofuel.",
      "They recently launched one of the world\u2019s first vehicles powered by bio-compressed natural gas. The innovative fuel source created at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in Barbados also uses wastewater from local rum distilleries, and dung from the island\u2019s indigenous blackbelly sheep which provides the vital anaerobic bacteria.",
      "The team says any car can be converted to run on the gas via a simple and affordable four-hour installation process, using an easily available kit, at a total cost of around $2,500 (\u00a31,940).",
      "Researchers had initially looked into using sugarcane to reduce reliance on costly, imported fossil fuels and help steer the Caribbean towards its ultimate target of zero emissions.",
      "However, despite Barbados being one of few islands still producing sugarcane, the quantity was deemed insufficient for the team\u2019s ambitious goals, explains the project\u2019s founder Dr Legena Henry.",
      "Sargassum on the other hand, she grimaces, is something \u201cwe will never run out of\u201d.",
      "\u201cTourism has suffered a lot from the seaweed; hotels have been spending millions on tackling it. It\u2019s caused a crisis,\u201d Dr Henry, a renewable energy expert and UWI lecturer, continues.",
      "The idea that it could have a valuable purpose was suggested by one of her students, Brittney McKenzie, who had observed the volume of trucks being deployed to transport sargassum from Barbados\u2019 beaches.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d just spent three weeks researching sugarcane. But I looked at Brittney\u2019s face and she was so excited, I couldn\u2019t break her heart,\u201d Dr Henry recalls.",
      "\u201cWe already had rum distillery waste water so we decided to put that with sargassum and see what happened.\u201d",
      "Brittney was tasked with collecting seaweed from beaches and setting up small scale bioreactors to conduct preliminary research.",
      "\u201cWithin just two weeks we got pretty good results,\u201d Brittney tells the BBC. \u201cIt was turning into something even bigger than we initially thought.\u201d",
      "The team filed a patent on their formula and, in 2019, presented their project to potential investors during a side meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York.",
      "Upon touchdown back in Barbados, Dr Henry\u2019s phone was \u201cbuzzing\u201d with messages of congratulation \u2013 including one from US non-profit Blue Chip Foundation offering $100,000 to get the work off the ground.",
      "Biologist Shamika Spencer was hired to experiment with differing amounts of sargassum and waste water to figure out which combination produced the most biogas.",
      "She says she leapt at the chance to take part.",
      "\u201cSargassum has been plaguing the region for several years,\u201d Ms Spencer, who is from Antigua and Barbuda, explains. \u201cI had always wondered about this new seaweed ruining the beaches in Antigua, and when I came to Barbados to study I noticed it here too.\u201d",
      "The algae do not just threaten tourism. They also pose a threat to human health through the hydrogen sulphide they release as they decomposes, along with native wildlife like critically endangered sea turtle hatchlings which get trapped in thick mats of beached seaweed.",
      "Water pollution and warming seas are credited with the upsurge in sargassum, another cataclysmic result of climate change that the Caribbean has done little to contribute to but often bears the brunt of.",
      "Calls for eco reparations from leaders including Barbados' leader Mia Mottley and Antigua\u2019s Prime Minister Gaston Browne have been clamorous in recent years as the region battles ever-rising sea levels and worsening storms.",
      "While waiting for those to bear fruit, this project represents one example of the Caribbean taking its environmental future into its own hands.",
      "\u201cI realised it was important that after removing the sargassum from beaches, it doesn\u2019t just go to landfills,\u201d Ms Spencer continues.",
      "\u201cBy repurposing it in vehicles you protect tourism and prevent people from inhaling it. When we scale up to fuel more vehicles it will require a very large volume.\u201d",
      "Watching the successful test drive of a biogas-charged Nissan Leaf \u2013 supplied by the Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \u2013 was utterly exhilarating, smiles Dr Henry.",
      "The MIT-educated mechanical engineer knew she was risking her reputation should the venture fail.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep the night before the test drive event,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was putting my whole life\u2019s work on the line.\u201d",
      "Dr Henry and her husband, career data scientist Nigel Henry, created deep tech firm Rum and Sargassum Inc and are on a mission to change the face of energy production in the Caribbean.",
      "Both are originally from leading oil producer Trinidad, studied in the US and were determined to bring their skills back home.",
      "\u201cMy goal is to help build up this region,\u201d Dr Henry says. \u201cWe are now setting up a four-car pilot to demonstrate real life working prototypes to convince funders that this is workable and scalable.\u201d",
      "She estimates it will cost around $2m to display initial commercial activity and $7.5m to reach the point where the company is able to sell gas to 300 taxis in Barbados.",
      "Potential funders include the US Agency for Internationals Development, the European Union and international development banks through debt financing.",
      "The team plans to expand its work by setting up a biogas station to replace its small existing facility.",
      "UWI hopes to introduce other sargassum-based innovations too, such as pest control products.",
      "Ms Spencer says it\u2019s been \"heart-warming\u201d to witness the results of the team\u2019s research.",
      "\u201cJust seeing the actual potential is motivating me to keep working,\u201d she adds.",
      "As for Brittney, five years after her eureka moment, she says she\u2019s still \u201cpinching\u201d herself.",
      "\u201cTo see the car in action was mind-blowing,\u201d she grins. \u201cI would encourage all young scientists to press ahead with their ideas. You never know when you might make the next big discovery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken years of work, plenty of grit and pushing against walls to reach this point,\u201d Dr Henry concurs. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of UWI innovation and is exportable to the wider world, because it\u2019s not just the Caribbean that\u2019s affected; sargassum also impacts parts of West Africa, South America and Florida.",

    "story": [
      "After spending more than 30 years behind bars for killing their parents, Lyle and Erik Menendez have a shot at being released from prison.",
      "The 1989 murder case, which has gripped the US for decades, burst into life again this autumn when Los Angeles's top prosecutor backed the brothers' bid for resentencing.",
      "The move could allow for their immediate release - if approved by a judge and a parole board.",
      "But their path to freedom will face a few hurdles.",
      "The brothers will appear in court by video link on Monday to discuss next steps in their case.",
      "Here's more about what's happening with their bid for resentencing, and two other ways the Menendez brothers could be freed.",
      "What did the Menendez brothers do?",
      "Jose and Kitty Menendez were found dead inside their Beverly Hills mansion after being shot 13 times in August 1989.",
      "Their sons - Erik and Lyle - called police, telling authorities they had got home and found their parents dead.",
      "The brutal nature of the crime led authorities to thinking maybe it was a mob hit.",
      "But the brothers started to draw scrutiny with their behaviour - lavish spending sprees including buying Rolex watches, and gambling and partying.",
      "A confession to their psychologist was their undoing. The doctor\u2019s girlfriend secretly recorded their confession and reported it to authorities.",
      "In March 1990, the brothers were charged by police. They went to trial in 1993 and the brothers admitted to the killings but argued they acted out of self-defence.",
      "They outlined years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse - namely by their father, Jose, a music and film executive in Hollywood.",
      "Lyle and Erik testified that they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative and that they believed their parents were planning to kill them.",
      "Family members testified about abuse they witnessed but none said they saw sexual abuse firsthand.",
      "Prosecutors argued their motive was money - namely their parents' $14m (\u00a310.8m) fortune.",
      "Their first trial ended with a mistrial, but a second trial in 1995 led to them to being convicted of first-degree murder.",
      "Who wants the Menendez brothers released?",
      "Fast forward nearly three decades, and public interest has been renewed, after a successful Netflix drama and docuseries. Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Rosie O\u2019Donnell have publicly supported the brothers\u2019 release.",
      "More than two dozen members of the Menendez family have issued a public plea for Erik and Lyle, now aged 53 and 56, to be released.",
      "Those family members alleged the boys endured horrific sexual abuse at the hands of their father and are not a threat to society.",
      "Kitty Menendez's sister, Joan Anderson VanderMolen, argued \u201cthe whole world wasn\u2019t ready to believe that the boys could be raped, or that young men could be victims of sexual violence\".",
      "She said that now \u201cwe know better\" and \"a jury today would never deliver such a harsh sentence\".",
      "But the family isn't in total agreement.",
      "A lawyer for Kitty Menendez\u2019s brother, Milton Andersen, called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and said their \"actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades\".",
      "\"Jose was shot six times, and Kitty was shot 10 times, including a shot to her face after Erik reloaded.\"",
      "Mr Andersen believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\", according to his lawyer, Kathy Cady.",
      "Resentencing could lead to release",
      "Current Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n agreed to reexamine the case, and in late October, he recommended the brothers be resentenced to a lower penalty that would make them immediately eligible for parole.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n stated his decision was influenced by several factors, including the brothers' rehabilitation efforts during their time in prison.",
      "Court filings from his office highlighted the brothers' educational accomplishments - both have earned multiple degrees - and their contributions to the community, such as Lyle Menendez\u2019s creation of the GreenSpace prison beautification program.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n also noted that with today\u2019s deeper understanding of the impact of sexual and physical abuse on children, he thinks the trial would likely have been approached differently.",
      "But critics of Gasc\u00f3n say he only chose to get involved with the case as a last-ditch effort to help his poll numbers when he was running for re-election.",
      "His loss, to Nathan Hochman, has thrown the case in the air.",
      "The new district attorney promised to be tougher on crime. He takes office on 2 December, and a crucial hearing to examine the Menendez brothers' potential resentencing is slated for 11 December.",
      "The change in leadership at the district attorney's office has raised questions about the future of the resentencing effort.",
      "Mr Hochman said he doesn't want to delay the 11 December resentencing hearing but might have to, so he has adequate time to review the case, which includes reading transcripts of the original trials and both brothers' prison disciplinary records.",
      "He has also questioned the role politics could have played in Mr Gascon\u2019s decision to back their resentencing.",
      "If the judge ultimately approves their resentencing, the case would move forward to a parole board, which would determine whether they can be freed on parole. The panel will read their psychological evaluations, review letters from investigating officers, and hear testimony from surviving family members.",
      "Other routes to freedom?",
      "The case has garnered widespread interest and led the court to announce they'd hold a lottery to determine which members of the public can attend Monday's hearing.",
      "Only 16 seats are available. The county is home to more than 10 million people.",
      "If their bid for resentencing fails, they are pursuing other avenues that could lead to their release, including:",
      "Clemency: the Menendez brothers\u2019 defence attorney Mark Geragos filed a clemency request with Governor Gavin Newsom, opening a second potential path to freedom.",
      "Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother\u2019s convictions.",
      "But the governor has said any decision he makes will be based on what newly-elected district attorney determines after reviewing the case in full.",
      "Habeas Corpus: The Menendez brothers\u2019 last path to freedom hinges on a habeas corpus petition filed last year, which seeks review of new evidence that was not presented at the trial.",
      "It claims their convictions and prison sentences are unconstitutional in light of, what they allege, is newly uncovered evidence that the brothers were the victims of childhood sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez.",
      "This includes allegations from former Menudo member Roy Rossell\u00f3, who claimed in the 2023 docuseries Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed that he was raped by music executive Jose Menendez.",
      "Another piece of evidence is a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin eight months before the murders detailing alleged abuse, which supports his cousin\u2019s trial testimony.",
      "Using the new evidence, the petition seeks to vacate their first-degree murder convictions in pursuit of a lesser charge such as manslaughter, which could result in an early release from prison.",
      "Their life in prison",
      "Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole.",
      "Lyle Menendez married twice. His first marriage, to former model Anna Eriksson in 1996, ended in divorce after she reportedly discovered he was corresponding with other women.",

      "Erik Menendez married Tammi Saccoman in 1999, following a pen-pal relationship that blossomed into a romance. Tammi, who had previously been married, has been outspoken about her commitment to Erik.",
      "In 2005, she published a memoir titled They Said We'd Never Make It, detailing their relationship. Despite the challenges of marrying a man behind bars, Tammi has referred to their marriage as fulfilling, calling it a unique but strong partnership.",

      "Robert F Kennedy Jr has set his sights on changing how Americans eat and drink.",
      "From the dyes in Fruit Loops cereal to seed oils in chicken nuggets, Kennedy - who is President-elect Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) - has long spoken out against ingredients that he says hurt Americans' health.",

      "United by loyalty, Trump's new team have competing agendas",

      "Kennedy \u201cwill help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA\u201d, Colorado\u2019s Democratic Governor Jared Polis wrote on social media this week, welcoming his nomination. After receiving public backlash for praising him, Polis qualified his endorsement, writing on social media that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy\".",
      "Making America Healthy Again",
      "Leading up to the election, Kennedy - a former Democrat - offered several ideas for tackling chronic diseases under his slogan \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d.",
      "He has frequently advocated for eliminating ultra-processed foods - products altered to include added fats, starches and sugars, like frozen pizzas, crisps and sugary breakfast cereals, that are linked to health problems like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.",
      "He has taken aim primarily at school lunches, telling Fox News: \u201cWe have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now.\"",
      "Part of Kennedy's new mandate will include overseeing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has over 18,000 employees.",
      "The agency is in charge of ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and the US food supply, but has come under fire in recent years from some lawmakers and consumer groups, who have accused it of a lack of transparency and action on food safety.",
      "The 70-year-old has pledged to take a sledgehammer to the agency, and fire employees he says are part of a \"corrupt system\".",
      "\u201cThere are entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA \u2026 that have to go, that are not doing their job,\u201d Kennedy told MSNBC this month.",
      "He has also pushed for getting rid of food dyes, including Red No. 3, and other additives banned in other countries.",
      "The former Democrat has also singled out more controversial health issues, including fluoride in drinking water, which he says should be banned altogether, and raw milk, which he believes has health benefits despite the increased risk of bacterial contamination.",
      "He\u2019s also come after seed oils, writing on social media that Americans are being \u201cunknowingly poisoned\u201d by products like canola and sunflower oil that are used in fast foods.",
      "What the evidence says",
      "Several public health experts stand behind Kennedy\u2019s goal to tackle ultra-processed food, which they say the US eats at much higher rates than many other countries.",
      "\u201cIt is just thrilling to hear somebody argue for doing something about chronic disease,\u201d Ms Nestle said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s aim to get rid of certain food additives and dyes also could be beneficial, said Dr Peter Lurie, executive director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit group that advocates for food safety.",
      "The former FDA official said several food dyes, including Red No. 3 - which is banned in California - should also be blocked by the US government because of concerns about carcinogens.",
      "The FDA has pushed back on Kennedy\u2019s claim that the US allows thousands of additives that are banned in the European Union. A spokesperson said it was necessary \"to dig deeper and understand the context behind the numbers\" when comparing regulations in the US and EU, which use different methodologies.",
      "But public health experts and former officials said a number of Kennedy\u2019s goals were not worthwhile - and in some cases, harmful.",
      "For instance, drinking raw milk that has not been pasteurized - a process that helps kill bacteria - can make people sick or even kill them, research has found.",
      "\u201cThere's no evidence of any nutritional benefit of any magnitude that we know that comes from non-pasteurizing of milk,\u201d said Dr Lurie.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposal to remove fluoride from drinking water also could be problematic, because fluoride, in the low levels found in water, has been proven to improve dental health, said University of Michigan nutritional sciences professor Jennifer Garner.",
      "Removing it from the water supply would also be out of his jurisdiction, because fluoride levels are controlled by states.",
      "And his claim that seed oils are helping drive the obesity epidemic is not based in science, either, Dr Lurie said.",
      "\u201cWe see no evidence for that. In fact, they seem like important products to the extent that they substitute for saturated fats\u201d such as butter, he said.",
      "Taking on Big Food",
      "Food reforms, while long part of the public health conversation, could also simply be unrealistic both politically and bureaucratically, some experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal more complicated than he lets on,\u201d said Dr Lurie. \u201cThese are real challenges, and you will encounter industry opposition at every turn.\u201d",
      "For one, the FDA does not have authority over the catch-all of \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d, several former officials told the BBC.",
      "Instead, they said, the process is more complicated. Both the US Department of Agriculture and the FDA regulate the food industry. The FDA does not make the rules - it carries out policies passed by Congress and works to limit unhealthy foods by enforcing limits and labelling on certain nutrients, like sodium and saturated fat.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments \u201cmake for great political rhetoric\u201d, Ms Garner said. \u201cIn my view, I don\u2019t see how that could be feasible without drastic changes in other policy and infrastructure.\u201d",
      "He will also face industry backlash for proposals to ban pesticides and genetically modified organisms commonly used by American farmers, former FDA officials said.",
      "\u201cThe businesses will complain,\u201d said Rosalie Lijinsky, a former FDA official of 33 years.",
      "The industry is used to limited oversight from both Democrats and Republicans - including under Trump's first term - while many of Kennedy\u2019s goals would involve even more rulemaking.",
      "Several food industry groups met with lawmakers before Kennedy\u2019s appointment this month to lobby against him, Politico reported last month.",
      "Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said this week that he planned to meet Kennedy before his confirmation hearing and \u201cspend a lot of time educating him about agriculture\u201d.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s position also puts him at odds with President-elect Trump, a longtime lover of fast food who worked to roll back stricter health requirements for school lunches during his first term.",
      "\u201cYou get some ideas that make a certain amount of sense, but they are exactly the kind to which this administration is hostile,\u201d Dr Lurie said.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Food Industry Association, which represents food retailers, producers and manufacturers, like General Mills, said it looked forward to working with Trump\u2019s team to \u201censure food and drug policy continues to be grounded in science, to reduce regulatory complexity\u201d.",
      "The industry complaints about Kennedy\u2019s agenda do not come as a surprise, said Jeff Hutt, a spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee, which is urging Republican lawmakers to confirm Kennedy.",
      "The goal of the health movement, Mr Hutt said, is \u201cprioritising the wellness of America over corporate profits\u201d.",
      "\u201cEven if the idea of banning ultra-processed food is not possible politically, it's a conversation that we need to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Pathway to change",
      "Kennedy still could work within existing US regulatory frameworks to improve America\u2019s food systems, former officials said.",
      "Ms Nestle said Kennedy could take on ultra-processed foods by altering the US Dietary Guidelines, which set nutritional standards for the industry and federal government programmes, including school lunches and military meals.",
      "\u201cThey have an enormous impact on the food industry,\u201d Ms Nestle said. \u201cThat would make a big difference.\u201d",
      "The guidelines are updated every five years by the US Department of Agriculture and DHHS, which has previously said there is not enough evidence against ultra-processed foods.",
      "Still, officials and nutrition experts raised concerns about the means by which Kennedy has proposed to enact his agenda, including firing the FDA\u2019s nutritionists.",
      "The move would have large ramifications for food safety, said Ms Lijinsky. \u201cIf you lose your top experts, you\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, Ms Garner said it is difficult to disentangle some of Kennedy\u2019s more reasonable food-improvement goals with the false health claims he has spread.",
      "\u201cThere's an opportunity here,\u201d Ms Garner said.",

    "summary": "The US president-elect has emphasised the scale of his win \u2013 but data shows that most voters picked someone else.",
    "story": [
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said his election victory handed him an \u201cunprecedented and powerful\u201d mandate to govern.",
      "He beat Democratic rival Kamala Harris in all seven closely watched swing states, giving him a decisive advantage overall.",
      "Trump\u2019s party has also won both chambers of Congress, giving the returning president considerable power to enact his agenda.",
      "He has broadened his appeal across nearly all groups of voters since his 2020 defeat. And in doing so he pulled off a comeback unmatched by any previously defeated president in modern history.",
      "But the data suggests it was a much closer contest than he and his allies are suggesting.",
      "His communications director Steven Cheung has called it a \"landslide\" victory. Yet it emerged this week that his share of the vote has fallen below 50%, as counting continues.",
      "\"It feels grandiose to me that they're calling it a landslide,\" said Chris Jackson, senior vice-president in the US team of polling firm Ipsos.",
      "The Trump language suggested overwhelming victories, Jackson said, when in fact it was a few hundred-thousand votes in key areas that propelled Trump back to the White House.",
      "That is thanks to America\u2019s electoral college system, which amplifies relatively slender victories in swing states.",
      "Here are three ways to look at his win.",
      "Trump missed majority of voters by a hair",
      "With 76.9 million votes and counting, Trump won what is known as the popular vote, according to the latest tally by the BBC\u2019s US partner, CBS News.",
      "That means he scored more votes than Harris (74.4 million), or any other candidate. No Republican has managed that feat since 2004.",
      "But as vote-tallying continues in some parts of the US, he has now slipped a fraction of a percentage point below 50% in his vote share. He is not expected to make up the gap as counting goes on in places like Democratic-leaning California.",
      "This was also the case in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the presidency despite losing the popular vote - having notched only 46% of the overall ballots cast.",
      "In 2024, Trump\u2019s win of both the popular vote and the presidency can be seen as an improvement on his last victory eight years ago.",
      "But Trump cannot say that he won the outright majority of the presidential votes that were cast in the election overall.",
      "To do so, he would need to have won more than 50%, as all victors have done for the last 20 years - other than Trump in 2016.",
      "For this reason, his claim to have a historic mandate \"may be overwrought\", suggested Chris Jackson of polling firm Ipsos, who said the language of Trump and his supporters was a tactic being used to \"justify the sweeping actions they're planning to take once they have control of the government\".",
      "His electoral college win was resounding",
      "On a different metric, Trump\u2019s win over Harris in 2024 appears more comfortable. He won 312 votes in the US electoral college compared with Harris\u2019s 226.",
      "And this is the number that really matters. The US election is really 50 state-by-state races rather than a single national one.",
      "The winner in any given state wins all of its electoral votes - for example, 19 in swing state Pennsylvania. Both candidates hoped to reach the magic number of 270 electoral votes to earn a majority in the college.",
      "Trump\u2019s 312 is better than Joe Biden's 306 and beats both Republican wins by George W Bush. But it is well shy of the 365 achieved by Barack Obama in 2008 or the 332 Obama won getting re-elected, or the colossal 525 by Ronald Reagan in 1984.",
      "And it is important to remember that the \u201cwinner takes all\u201d mechanic of the electoral college means that relatively slender wins in some critical areas can be amplified into what looks like a much more resounding triumph.",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?",
      "Trump is ahead by just over 230,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the latest numbers from CBS. All three states were the focus of intensive campaigning by both parties ahead of the 5 November vote.",
      "If just over 115,000 voters in that group had instead picked Harris, she would have won those Rust Belt swing states, giving her enough votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.",
      "That might sound like a lot of people but the number is a drop in the ocean of the more-than-150 million votes that were cast nationwide.",
      "In other swing states in the Sun Belt - namely Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina - the margins of victory for Trump were much more comfortable.",

      "There is another measure with which to consider Trump\u2019s win, which is to look at the number of votes he received, although this is a relatively crude measure.",
      "The 76.9 million that he has amassed so far is the second-highest tally in American history.",
      "It is important to remember that the US population, and therefore the electorate, is constantly growing. The more-than-150 million people who voted in the US this year is more than double the number of 74 million who went to the polls in 1964.",

Such support would make him the first treasury secretary to openly champion cryptocurrency, sending a clear signal that Trump is serious about establishing the US as the \"crypto capital of the planet\".",

      "Still basking in the glow of his election victory, the president-elect was flying back to West Palm Beach last Wednesday afternoon after a cordial meeting with President Joe Biden.",
      "That morning Gaetz was not even on the shortlist for the position of America\u2019s top law officer, according to Politico, but Trump had felt underwhelmed by his other options.",
      "A plan hatched on a plane",
      "On so-called Trump Force One that day were Gaetz himself, Elon Musk, Trump\u2019s incoming White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn, reports the New York Times.",
      "Epshteyn reportedly set about convincing Trump that Gaetz should lead the justice department, which had conducted a sex-trafficking investigation into the lawmaker before dropping the matter.",
      "The allegation that Gaetz had sex with a minor, which he denies, was set to dominate and probably torpedo his nomination process.",
      "Losing his first choice is a setback to Trump and shows the reluctance of the Senate in ushering through a man who has no shortage of enemies in Congress.",
      "The woman Trump has picked instead, another Floridian Pam Bondi, would seem to have more allies and a smoother path ahead.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 23:23:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Pressure has been mounting on the ethics committee to release a report on Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general.",
    "story": [
      "A congressional ethics committee has failed to reach an agreement over whether to release a report on alleged sexual misconduct by Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's nominee to lead the US Department of Justice.",
      "The House committee met for two hours behind closed doors on Wednesday, as calls grew for details of its investigation into Gaetz, a former Florida congressman whose nomination to serve as attorney general has proved controversial.",
      "\"There was no consensus on this issue,\" Democratic Representative Susan Wild told reporters, adding that a vote had been taken but the bipartisan committee remained split along party lines.",
      "She said they would meet again on 5 December. It is unclear whether they could release the report into Gaetz, who denies any wrongdoing, before then.",
      "Pressure has mounted on the ethics committee to release its findings, as members of the Senate begin meeting with Gaetz ahead of a hearing when they will vote on whether to confirm him as attorney general.",
      "\"They\u2019ve been going great,\" Gaetz said of the meetings on Wednesday. \"Senators been giving me a lot of good advice. I'm looking forward to a hearing.\"",
      "The ethics committee had been preparing to vote on the report's release before Gaetz's abrupt resignation from the House, which came just after Trump's nomination, the New York Times reported.",
      "His departure cast doubt on whether the report would see the light of day, because having resigned he is no longer under congressional jurisdiction and the committee only investigates House members.",
      "The committee Chairman Michael Guest, a Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that he had \"some reservations\" about releasing the report because it is still going through the review process.",
      "He told CNN the committee would consider releasing it publicly or sending it directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but it remains uncertain whether it will leave the committee at all.",
      "Reporters and members of the media packed the hallway outside the room where members of the committee met on Wednesday. Most lawmakers remained tight-lipped as they passed the gauntlet of journalists on their way out of the meeting.",
      "Speaking to MSNBC afterward, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, a Democrat, said he had faith \"we will get to the right solution\".",
      "Gaetz, 42, is a lawyer who made a name for himself on Capitol Hill and cable news as a right-wing rabble rouser. He is a staunch defender of Trump and led a successful effort to oust Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year.",
      "Some of Gaetz's former House colleagues have voiced support for his nomination, including Speaker Mike Johnson, who called him a \"reformer\" who would \"bring a lot to the table\".",
      "But Gaetz also has been dogged by allegations of impropriety in recent years.",
      "The US justice department previously investigated him for allegations he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and violated sex trafficking laws. But the case was dropped and Gaetz, who denied the allegations, was never charged.",

      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "In June, the ethics committee announced it was investigating several allegations against Gaetz, including that he \u201cengaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favours to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct\u201d.",
      "Two women testified to the committee that Gaetz paid them \"for sex\", their lawyer, Joel Leppard, told CBS this week. One of the women also testified that she witnessed the then-congressman having sex with a minor during a party in 2017, the lawyer said.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says the accusations are politically motivated.",
      "\"Lies were weaponised to try to destroy me,\" Gaetz posted on X on Friday. \"These lies resulted in prosecution, conviction, and prison. For the liars, not me.\"",
      "Trump showed no sign of backing down on his cabinet pick this week.",
      "\"Matt Gaetz will be the next attorney general. He\u2019s the right man for the job and will end the weaponisation of our justice system,\" Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfieffer said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Senators of both parties have spoken in favour of accessing the ethics report.",
      "Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, demanded that the other committee \u201cpreserve and share\u201d the report with his panel.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: This information could be relevant to the question of Mr Gaetz\u2019s confirmation as the next attorney general of the United States, and our constitutional responsibility of advice and consent,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who also sits on the judiciary committee, said: \"I think that if they want a speedy consideration of this nomination, we've got to have as much transparency as we can have.\"",

    "story": [
      "At the epicentre of this devastating family drama is Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a diminutive 72-year-old woman, drugged by her former husband and abused for a decade by dozens of strangers he had recruited online.",
      "Watching her entering the court in Avignon and giving evidence, it was staggering to imagine the amount of abuse her body sustained.",
      "But as other members of her family have taken the stand, it has become painfully clear that no-one has emerged unscathed from the storm unleashed by the actions of the Pelicot patriarch.",
      "The damage to this family is clear. Individually, they have described the destructive force that engulfed them in November 2020 as a \u201ctsunami\u201d that left nothing but ruin in its wake.",
      "Dominique Pelicot was finally caught after an alert security guard caught him filming under women\u2019s skirts.",
      "But it took weeks for police to discover the full truth that ultimately tore his family apart.",
      "Warning: This story contains details some readers may find disturbing",
      "For years, he had been drugging his wife and recruiting men online to rape her while  she was unconscious.",
      "He filmed the abuse and neatly classified each visit in folders on his hard drive. Faced with the evidence, Dominique Pelicot admitted the rape charges against him.",
      "Alongside obscene language describing his videos, he added captions with the men\u2019s names. Fifty other men have been on trial with him and only a handful admit rape. More than 20 others could not be identified and are still at large.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has attended almost all of this trial. She waived her anonymity and allowed the public to see what she had endured.",
      "The videos leave no doubt that the sex acts were not consensual. Ms Pelicot can be seen lying on the bed, snoring, as her husband whispers instructions to various men to touch her, prod her, use her.",
      "Artificial sleep affords her mind a degree of protection, but her body becomes an object.",
      "She was, in her own words, treated \u201clike a rag doll, like a garbage bag\u201c.",
      "\"I am 72 now and I don't know how much time I have left,\u201d she told the court last week.",
      "'You will die lying'",
      "The magnitude of Dominique Pelicot\u2019s betrayal and crimes is such that the aftershocks have rippled far beyond his ex-wife.",
      "The Pelicots\u2019 middle child, Caroline Darian, now 45, screamed her anguish at her father in court as she demanded to know the truth about photos found on his computer. Entitled \u201cMy naked daughter\u201d, the images show her semi-naked and, she says, clearly drugged.",
      "Mr Pelicot has offered various and at times contradictory explanations for the pictures, although he has denied abusing his daughter. \u201cI never touched you,\u201d he pleaded with her.",
      "But his duplicity has been abundantly exposed during this trial, and he has clearly lost the right to be believed by his daughter.",
      "\u201cYou are a liar,\u201d she shouted back at him. \u201cI am sick of your lies, you are alone in your lie, you will die lying.\u201d",
      "Fighting back tears, she accused her father of looking at her \u201cwith incestuous eyes\u201d.",
      "Caroline Darian has told the court she feels she is the trial\u2019s \u201cforgotten victim\u201d as, unlike her mother\u2019s case, there is no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted on her.",
      "She has founded a charity to highlight the dangers of drug-induced assault and published a book in 2022 detailing her family\u2019s trauma. In it, she hinted at a rift with her mother, who she found had dropped off a bundle of warm clothes for her father in jail, weeks after his crimes came to light.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Caroline wrote. \u201cShe was still looking after the person who got her raped for a decade.\u201d",
      "That apparent rift was exploited by a combative defence lawyer who suggested Gis\u00e8le Pelicot had chosen her former husband over her daughter by not demanding the truth about the photos of Caroline. Gis\u00e8le shook her head, but Caroline cracked a slight smile, appearing to acknowledge the lawyer's description.",
      "When Caroline\u2019s brothers David and Florian took the stand they made repeated references to the pain she was going through, urging their father to tell the truth.",
      "Stifling sobs, Florian, 38, the youngest of the family, turned to face Dominique Pelicot sitting in a glass box to his left and said: \u201cIf you have any dignity and humanity \u2013 you don\u2019t have anything left to lose anyway \u2013 tell Caroline the truth.\u201d",
      "He also spoke of his longstanding suspicion he was the product of an affair his mother had in the 1980s, which was compounded by a faint but lifelong feeling that his father loved his siblings more than him.",
      "In a desperate search for answers, he wondered out loud whether he could be the \u201cmotive\u201d for his father\u2019s crimes. He said he would seek out a paternity test, adding it would be a \u201crelief\u201d not to be Dominique Pelicot\u2019s son.",
      "Through tears, Florian painted a desolate picture of what his life had become. His marriage to the mother of his three children, Aurore, has not survived revelations that Dominique Pelicot also surreptitiously took photographs of her.",
      "Despite their separation, this slight, softly-spoken woman has frequently attended the trial and said it had exposed the \u201cbanality\u201d of abuse.",
      "Aurore, herself a survivor of incest, is having to live with the regret of not having listened to her instincts regarding Mr Pelicot. \u201cIf she had, she may have been able to alter the course of events,\u201d her lawyer said.",
      "'My childhood has disappeared'",
      "The eldest of the Pelicot children, David, is a burly man of 50 who bears a striking resemblance to his father.",
      "Taking the stand this week, he described how he had grown closer to Dominique Pelicot when he had himself become a father.",
      "Then, his voice growing more anguished and clutching the stand as if to steady himself, he recalled the harrowing detail the night his mother told him of his father\u2019s arrest. \u201cAll of us know where we were when the tsunami hit,\u201d he said.",
      "Naked photographs of his wife Celine, pregnant with their twin daughters, were also found among Mr Pelicot\u2019s files. She was in the bathroom, snapped with a hidden camera.",
      "His voice heavy with emotion, David described watching his mother, frail and lost, standing on a train platform, her life reduced to her dog and a suitcase.",
      "Recalling the birthday parties his parents used to throw for him and his siblings, to the envy of their friends, he said: \u201cMy childhood has disappeared; it was erased.\u201d",
      "The trauma rippling through this family seems without end. David\u2019s son, now 18, wonders what really happened when Dominique asked him to \u201cplay doctor\u201d as a child.",
      "His young siblings, the family\u2019s lawyer said on Wednesday, \u201cwill have to find their place in a family in which their grandmother, their mother, their brother and their aunts have all been victims of their grandfather.\u201d",
      "Caroline\u2019s young son is still profoundly shaken by the carefully worded revelation, four years ago, that his beloved grandfather hurt his grandmother.",
      "\u201cThis is just a sample of the depth of the suffering caused by a rape in the family,\u201d lawyer St\u00e9phane Babonneau said in his closing arguments.",
      "A verdict is expected on 20 December. Mr Pelicot is facing 20 years in jail \u2013 the maximum sentence for rape in France.",
      "And for the rest of his family the trauma will live on. Because none of them will ever know for certain what he may or may not have done.",
      "In one of the shaky phone videos shown in court, a tall naked man stands in the middle of a dark bedroom. Another man sits on the bed, smiling, next to an unconscious woman lying on her side, lightly snoring.",
      "Behind her, on a chest of drawers, is a photograph, clearly discernible despite the low lighting.",

      "Nigeria has one of the highest birth rates in the world, with women often facing social pressure to conceive and even ostracisation or abuse if they cannot.",
      "Under this pressure, some women go to extremes to realise their dream of motherhood.",
      "For over a year, BBC Africa Eye has been investigating the \u201ccryptic pregnancy\u201d scam.",
      "Scammers posing as doctors or nurses convince women that they have a \u201cmiracle fertility treatment\u201d guaranteed to get them pregnant. The initial \u201ctreatment\u201d usually costs hundreds of dollars and consists of an injection, a drink, or a substance inserted into the vagina.",
      "None of the women or officials we spoke to during our investigation know for sure what is in these drugs. But some women have told us they led to changes in their bodies - such as swollen stomachs - which further convinced them they were pregnant.",
      "Women given the \u201ctreatment\u201d are warned not to visit any conventional doctors or hospitals, as no scan or pregnancy test would detect \u201cthe baby\u201d, which the scammers claim is growing outside the womb.",
      "When it\u2019s time to \u201cdeliver\u201d the baby, women are told labour will only begin once they are induced with a \u201crare and expensive drug\u201d, requiring further payment.",
      "Accounts of how the \u201cdelivery\u201d happens vary, but all are disturbing. Some are sedated only to wake up with a Caesarean-like incision mark. Others say they are given an injection that causes a drowsy, hallucinatory state in which they believe they\u2019re giving birth.",
      "Either way, the women end up with babies they are supposed to have given birth to.",
      "Chioma tells commissioner Obinabo that when her time to \u201cdeliver\u201d came, the so-called doctor injected her in the waist and told her to push. She does not spell out how she ended up with Hope, but says the delivery was \u201cpainful\u201d.",
      "Our team manages to infiltrate one of these secretive \u201cclinics\u201d - connecting with a woman known as \u201cDr Ruth\u201d to her clients -  by posing as a couple who have been trying to conceive for eight years.",
      "This so-called \"Dr Ruth\" runs her clinic every second Saturday of the month in a dilapidated hotel in the town of Ihiala, in the south-eastern Anambra state. Outside her room, dozens of women wait for her in the hotel corridors, some with visibly protruding stomachs.",
      "The whole atmosphere is buzzing with positivity. At one point, huge celebrations erupt inside the room after a woman is told she is pregnant.",
      "When it\u2019s our undercover reporters\u2019 turn to see her, \"Dr Ruth\" tells them the treatment is guaranteed to work.",
      "She offers the woman an injection, claiming it will enable the couple to \u201cselect\u201d the sex of their future baby - a medical impossibility.",
      "After they turn down the injection, \"Dr Ruth\" hands them a sachet of crushed pills as well as some more pills for them to take at home, along with instructions on when to have intercourse.",

      "All of this misinformation helps solidify women\u2019s belief in the scam.",
      "Members of these groups are not only from Nigeria, but also from South Africa, the Caribbean, and the US.",
      "The scammers also sometimes manage, and post in, these groups, enabling them to reach out to women expressing an interest in the \"treatment\".",
      "Once someone expresses readiness to start the scam process, they are invited into more secure WhatsApp groups. There, admins share information about \u201ccryptic clinics\u201d and what the process involves.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m still confused\u2019",
      "Authorities tell us that to complete the \u201ctreatment\u201d, the scammers need new-born babies and to do that they seek out women who are desperate and vulnerable, many of them young and pregnant, in a country where abortion is illegal.",
      "In February 2024, the Anambra state health ministry raided the facility where Chioma \u201cdelivered\u201d Hope.",
      "The BBC obtained footage of the raid, which showed a huge complex made up of two buildings.",
      "In one were rooms containing medical equipment - apparently for clients - while in the other were several pregnant women being kept against their will. Some were as young as 17.",
      "Some tell us they were tricked into going there, unaware their babies would be sold to the scammer\u2019s clients.",
      "Others, like Uju, which is not her real name, felt too scared to tell their family they were pregnant and sought a way out. She said she was offered 800,000 naira ($470; \u00a3380) for the baby.",
      "Asked if she regrets her decision to sell her baby, she says: \u201cI\u2019m still confused.\u201d",

      "But Chioma pleads her case, and the commissioner eventually accepts her explanation that she is a victim herself and that she hadn\u2019t realised what was going on.",
      "On this basis she allows Chioma and Ike to keep the baby - unless the biological parents come forward to claim him.",
      "But unless attitudes towards women, infertility, reproductive rights and adoption change, scams like this will continue to thrive, experts warn.",

      "Many of the rich country voices at the UN's climate conference were amazed that developing nations were unhappy with what on the surface seems a huge settlement. It is an improvement - on the current contribution of $100bn (\u00a379.8bn) a year.",
      "However, the developing world, which had pushed for more, had many genuine issues with the final sum.",
      "A massive deal, but bitter divisions remain",
      "There were complaints it simply was not enough and that it was a mixture of grants and loans. And countries were deeply annoyed by the way the wealthy waited until the last minute to reveal their hand.",

      "\"This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face.\"",

      "A more generous cash settlement at COP29 would undoubtedly have had a positive knock-on effect on those efforts.",

      "COP itself is on the ropes",
      "Shepherding 200 countries to an intricate deal on climate finance was always going to be a tough task. But for hosts Azerbaijan, a country with no real history of involvement in the COP process, it proved to be almost beyond them.",
      "The country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, did not help matters by describing oil and gas as a \"gift from God\". His blunt attacks - accusing \"Western fake news media\", charities and politicians of \"spreading disinformation\" - did not improve matters.",
      "Azerbaijan follows Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as the third authoritarian state in a row to host COP, raising concerns about how host countries are selected.",

      "The quiet ascent of China",
      "With the role of the US in future climate talks in doubt because of Trump, attention shifted to who might become the real climate leader in the expected absence of the US over the next four years.",

      "The world\u2019s largest carbon emitter was largely silent at this year's COP, only showing its hand to give details for the first time on the amount of climate finance it gives to developing countries.",
      "China is still defined by the United Nations as a \"developing\" country, meaning it has no formal obligation to cut greenhouse gas emissions or provide financial help to poorer countries.",
      "However, China has agreed to a formula in the finance deal that would allow its contributions to be counted in the overall fund for climate-vulnerable countries, on a voluntary basis.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 05:30:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Faced with a housing and homelessness crisis, Halifax has set aside city sites for people to live in tents. Not everyone is behind the plan.",
    "story": [
      "As cities across North America grapple with homelessness, one Canadian city has taken a different approach by regulating tent encampments instead of banning them, as it tries to tackle what one official calls the issue \"of the decade\".",
      "Andrew Goodsell has called his small orange tent on a grassy patch in downtown Halifax home for almost a year.",
      "In late October, on a park bench outside his makeshift dwelling, the 38-year-old described life at the homeless encampment where he lives with about a dozen or so others as \u201cdepressing\u201d.",
      "\u201cI wake up in an area I don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Mr Goodsell said, as a stream of cars drove by.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d much rather wake up in a spot where I could take a shower and maybe make myself something to eat. But I\u2019ll still get myself out of bed.\u201d",
      "Mr Goodsell has been without a home on-and-off for a decade.",
      "He once got by with couch surfing or working minimum-wage jobs to pay rent, but with Halifax\u2019s skyrocketing housing costs, he can no longer afford a place to live.",
      "His encampment is one of nine sites chosen by the city as a place where people without housing can lawfully camp outside. The sites were approved this summer as a temporary, but some argue necessary, solution while indoor shelters are at-capacity.",
      "The policy has been adopted by at least one other municipality in Canada and is being considered by others who too are facing a rise in homelessness.",
      "It's in stark contrast to other North American cities where police officers forcibly remove homeless encampments. These so-called \"street sweeps\" have been criticised as violent and ineffective in addressing the housing crisis.",
      "But they have become increasingly popular as homelessness has grown since the pandemic. California has cleared more than 12,000 encampments since 2021, while cities like Fresno, California and Grants Pass, Oregon have passed complete bans on camping in public spaces.",
      "Proponents of banning encampments say that the campsites lead to disorder, and that funding should go to getting people off the streets.",
      "Among detractors of Halifax's approach are some encampment residents themselves, who say they want resources spent on affordable housing instead.",
      "\u201cCanada is one of the richest, most beautiful countries around,\u201d Mr Goodsell said. \u201cWe have so much land, so much resource, but we must be one of the greediest countries out there.\u201d",
      "Although several Canadian cities, including Halifax, have tried to remove homeless encampments in the past, recent court decisions in British Columbia and Ontario have ruled that people without homes can camp outside if there are no appropriate indoor shelters available.",
      "In contrast, the US Supreme Court ruled in June that cities can fine and arrest homeless people, even if there is no shelter for them to go to, paving the way for the outright bans on encampments in California and Oregon.",
      "Another difference is the growing recognition in Canada that previous approaches have failed, says Stepan Wood, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, who has studied the issue.",
      "\u201cThe approach up until a couple years ago had been to clear them out, but it\u2019s now no longer deniable that that doesn\u2019t solve the problem,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Canada's national database estimates that there are 235,000 homeless people across the country in a given year, though experts argue that number is higher.",
      "This figure puts the rate of homelessness in Canada above that of the US and England, according to a comparison of official data. Globally, many cities have seen a rise in homelessness since the pandemic.",
      "In 2018, Halifax - the largest city on Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast with a population of around 518,000 - only had 18 people sleeping rough, said Max Chauvin, the director of housing and homelessness in Halifax. Now it's over 200.",
      "While Halifax has approved nine designated encampment sites, only five are operating. Each has a proposed limit of up to a dozen tents, but most are over capacity.",
      "The city provides the sites with portable toilets, while outreach workers come by weekly to drop off bottled water and check in on people, encampment residents told the BBC.",
      "Sometimes they will bring things that residents need, like a coat, or a warmer sleeping bag for the winter.",
      "Mr Chauvin said the designated encampments are born out of a realisation that the city has run out of options to immediately address its housing crisis.",
      "The city is waiting for the provincial government to ramp up affordable housing construction. Nova Scotia has not built any new public housing units since 1995.",
      "In the meantime, \u201cthe question becomes: 'Where are people going to go?'\u201d Mr Chauvin said.",
      "He believes solving the housing crisis will be \u201cthe item of the decade\u201d for his city and others.",
      "\u201cOne of the largest groups of homelessness we see growing is simply people who don't have enough money to pay rent, and that\u2019s new,\u201d he said, adding that includes seniors, students, and entire families.",
      "Mr Chauvin also points to a lack of accessible healthcare for people with mental and physical illnesses.",
      "Proponents of the designated sites say they prevent the criminalisation of people who are homeless and allow the city to concentrate its outreach services.",
      "Still, Halifax's policy is both provisional and divisive.",
      "It was a focal point of the city\u2019s October mayoral election, where the winner promised to end the expansion of designated encampments and to remove unlawful ones.",
      "Trish Purdy, a city councillor, unsuccessfully fought to remove a proposed designated site in her district, after hearing from constituents who feared it would bring crime and drug use.",
      "She acknowledged that the issue is socially and morally complex, but said she believes allowing people to live in \u201chorrible conditions\u201d is not \u201cempathetic or compassionate\u201d.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure the residents who live by any of the encampments could tell you they didn\u2019t receive any empathy or compassion when the encampments were placed on their doorstep,\u201d Ms Purdy told the BBC.",
      "One such encampment in Dartmouth, a Halifax suburb, sits adjacent to a row of public housing units, where residents complain of needle debris, violence and disputes with those living at the site.",
      "\u201cThis used to be a fun field where the kids can come out and play baseball or kickball,\u201d said Clarissa, a mother of three who declined to give her last name.",
      "\u201cNow we can\u2019t even do that, because we\u2019re too worried about stepping on a needle.\u201d",
      "Clarissa said she and her neighbours were not consulted about the encampment  and believes the site was chosen because their neighbourhood is low-income.",
      "But Ames Mathers, who lives near another encampment, called its residents her neighbours.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really messed up that people are having to live in parks at all as an only option for housing,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a housing crisis, and our province and city are dropping the ball.\u201d",
      "Some encampment residents told the BBC they welcomed knowing they wouldn't be asked to leave at a moment's notice. But many said they themselves didn't always feel safe at the sites.",
      "They also question the government's willingness to find them housing, saying they have received more help from volunteers than officials. They note that multiple high-rise condominiums are under development in Halifax - none of which, they say, are affordable.",
      "\u201cWe would like to be treated like people,\u201d said Samantha Nickerson, who lived with her fiance, Trent Smith, at the same encampment as Mr Goodsell.",
      "\u201cSome of us really are trying hard to get our lives back together and work.\u201d",
      "Ms Nickerson and Mr Smith, who are in their 30s, said they faced violence from other residents and were often verbally harassed by members of the public.",
      "\u201cWe understand that this is an eyesore, and nobody wants it,\u201d Ms Nickerson said.",

      "By mid-November, the couple had been moved to a temporary indoor shelter with the help of volunteers.",
      "Mr Goodsell and a handful of others remain at site, which was recently de-designated over concerns it would be in the way of snow-clearing operations.",
      "He said he has not been offered indoor shelter and does not want to be uprooted to another encampment.",
      "He has outfitted his tent for the coming harsh Canadian winter as he waits for news.",

    "title": "Why Indians are risking it all to chase the American Dream",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:11:49 GMT",
    "summary": "A surge in illegal border crossings by Indians into the US has left many puzzled -what\u2019s going on?",
    "story": [
      "In October, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sent a chartered flight carrying Indian nationals back home, marking a growing trend in deportations to India.",
      "This was no ordinary flight - it was one of multiple large-scale \u201cremoval flights\u201d carried out this year, each typically carrying more than 100 passengers. The flights were returning groups of Indian migrants who \"did not establish a legal basis to remain in the US\".",
      "According to US officials, the latest flight carrying adult men and women was routed to Punjab, close to many deportees' places of origin. No precise breakdown of hometowns was provided.",
      "In the US fiscal year 2024 which ended in September, more than 1,000 Indian nationals had been repatriated by charter and commercial flights, according to Royce Bernstein Murray, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cThat has been part of a steady increase in removals from the US of Indian nationals over the past few years, which corresponds with a general increase in encounters that we have seen with Indian nationals in the last few years as well,\u201d Ms Murray told a media briefing. (Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country\u2019s borders with Mexico or Canada.)",
      "As the US ramps up repatriations of Indian nationals, concerns grow about how President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies will affect them. Trump has already promised the biggest deportation of migrants in history.",
      "Since October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CPB) officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting unauthorised crossings at both the northern and southern land borders.",
      "\u201cThough smaller than the numbers from Latin America and the Caribbean, Indian nationals represent the largest group of migrants from outside the Western Hemisphere encountered by the CPB in the past four years,\u201d say Gil Guerra and Sneha Puri, immigration analysts at Niskanen Center, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "As of 2022, an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were in the US, making them the third-largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. Unauthorised immigrants in all make up 3% of US\u2019s total population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "Looking at the data, Mr Guerra and Ms Puri have identified notable trends in the spike in Indians attempting illegal border crossings.",
      "For one, the migrants are not from the lowest economic strata. But they cannot secure tourist or student visas to the US, often due to lower education or English proficiency.",
      "Instead, they rely on agencies charging up to $100,000 (\u00a379,000), sometimes using long and arduous routes designed to dodge border controls. To afford this, many sell farms or take out loans. Not surprisingly, data from the US immigration courts in 2024 reveals that the majority of Indian migrants were male, aged 18-34.",
      "Second, Canada on the northern border has become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with a visitor visa processing time of 76 days (compared to up to a year for a US visa in India).",
      "The Swanton Sector - covering the states of Vermont and counties in New York and New Hampshire - has experienced a sudden surge in encounters with Indian nationals since early this year, peaking at 2,715 in June, the researchers found.",
      "Earlier, most irregular Indian migrants entered the Americas through the busier southern border with Mexico via El Salvador or Nicaragua, both of which facilitated migration. Until November last year, Indian nationals enjoyed visa-free travel to El Salvador.",
      "\u201cThe US-Canada border is also longer and less guarded than the US-Mexico border. And while it is not necessarily safer, criminal groups do not have the same presence there as they do along the route from South and Central America,\u201d Mr Guerra and Ms Puri say.",
      "Thirdly, much of the migration appears to originate from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, which has traditionally seen people migrating overseas. The other source of origin is Gujarat, the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Punjab, which accounts for a large share of irregular Indian migrants, is facing economic hardships, including high unemployment, farming distress and a looming drug crisis.",
      "Migration has also long been common among Punjabis, with rural youth still eager to move abroad.",
      "A recent study of 120 respondents in Punjab by Navjot Kaur, Gaganpreet Kaur and Lavjit Kaur found that 56% emigrated between ages 18-28, often after secondary education. Many funded their move through non-institutional loans, later sending remittances to their families.",
      "Then there has been a rise in tensions over the separatist Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish an independent homeland for Sikhs. \u201cThis has caused fear from some Sikhs in India about being unfairly targeted by authorities or politicians. These fears may also provide a credible basis for claims of persecution that allows them to seek asylum, whether or not true,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "But pinning down the exact triggers for migration is challenging.",
      "\u201cWhile motivations vary, economic opportunity remains the primary driver, reinforced by social networks and a sense of pride in having family members 'settled' in the US,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "Fourth, researchers found a shift in the family demographics of Indian nationals at the borders.",
      "More families are trying to cross the border. In 2021, single adults were overwhelmingly detained at both borders. Now, family units make up 16-18% of the detentions at both borders.",
      "This has sometimes led to tragic consequences. In January 2022, an Indian family of four - part of a group of 11 people from Gujarat - froze to death just 12m (39ft) from the border in Canada while attempting to enter the US.",
      "Pablo Bose, a migration and urban studies scholar at the University of Vermont, says Indians are trying to cross into the US in larger numbers because of more economic opportunities and \u201cmore ability to enter the informal economies in the US cities\u201d, especially the large ones like New York or Boston.",
      "\u201cFrom everything I know and interviews I have conducted, most of the Indians are not staying in the more rural locations like Vermont or upstate New York but rather heading to the cities as soon as they can,\u201d Mr Bose told the BBC. There, he says, they are entering mostly informal jobs like domestic labour and restaurant work.",
      "Things are likely to become more difficult soon. Veteran immigration official Tom Homan, who will be in charge of the country's borders following Trump's inauguration in January, has said that the northern border with Canada is a priority because illegal migration in the area is a \u201chuge national security issue\u201d.",
      "What happens next is unclear. \u201cIt remains to be seen if Canada would impose similar policies to prevent people migrating into the US from its borders. If that happens, we can expect a decline in detentions of Indians nationals at the border,\u201d says Ms Puri.",
      "Whatever the case, the dreams driving thousands of desperate Indians to seek a better life in the US are unlikely to fade, even as the road ahead becomes more perilous."

      "Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.",
      "In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.",
      "The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.",
      "Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? is back on Monday with a fresh mix of the four versions of the song that have been issued over the years.",
      "But the chorus of disapproval about the track, its stereotypical representation of an entire continent - describing it as a place \"where nothing ever grows; no rain nor rivers flow\" - and the way that recipients of the aid have been viewed as emaciated, helpless figures, has become louder over time.",
      "\"To say: 'Do they know it\u2019s Christmas?\u2019 is funny, it is insulting,\" says Dawit Giorgis, who in 1984 was the Ethiopian official responsible for getting the message out about what was happening in his country.",
      "His incredulity decades on is obvious in his voice and he remembers how he and his colleagues responded to the song.",
      "\"It was so untrue and so distorted. Ethiopia was a Christian country before England\u2026 we knew Christmas before your ancestors,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "But Mr Dawit has no doubt that the philanthropic response to the BBC film, by British journalist Michael Buerk and Kenyan cameraman Mohamed Amin, saved lives.",
      "As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.",

      "He praises the \"young and passionate people\" behind Band Aid - describing them as \"amazing\".",
      "His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.",
      "Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to a recent article in The Conversation about the \"problematic Christmas hit\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a pop song [expletive]\u2026 The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response,\"  he is quoted as saying.",
      "\"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive.\"",
      "He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 \"ceremonies were abandoned\".",
      "In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than \u00a33m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.",
      "He adds that Band Aid\u2019s swift action as a \"first responder\" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.",
      "But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.",
      "In the last week, Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his \"understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed\".",

      "\"I go to Ghana every Christmas\u2026 every December so we know there\u2019s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn\u2019t death in every tear.\"",
      "Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but \"Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it\".",
      "The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.",
      "When growing up \"it was not cool to be African in the UK\u2026 [because of] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me\", the singer said.",
      "Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King\u2019s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.",
      "He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his \"African peers at [a British] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals\".",
      "Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.",

      "In 2017, Sheeran himself won one of their \"Rusty Radiator\" awards for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.",
      "The organisers of the awards said \"the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in\".",
      "University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.",
      "More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.",
      "\"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Prof Girling\u2019s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.",
      "Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money. The professor says that some media outlets will not touch a fundraising story unless a celebrity is involved.",
      "But work by his colleague Martin Scott suggests that big stars can often distract from the central message of a campaign. Whereas the celebrity might benefit, the charity and the understanding of the issue that it is working on lose out.",
      "If a Band Aid-type project were to get off the ground now it would have to be centred on African artists, music journalist Christine Ochefu tells the BBC.",
      "\"The landscape for African artists and African music has changed so much that if there was a new release it would need to come from Afrobeats artists or amapiano artists or Afro-pop artists,\" she argues",
      "\"I don\u2019t think people could get away without thinking about the sentiment and imagery associated with the project and it couldn\u2019t continue the saviour narrative that Band Aid had.\"",
      "As King's College academic Dr Ademolu argues: \"Perhaps it's time to abandon the broken record and start anew - a fresh tune where Africa isn\u2019t just a subject, but a co-author, harmonising its own story.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 02:06:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Nila Ibrahimi won the International Children's Peace Prize for her work giving Afghan girls a voice.",
    "story": [
      "When Nila Ibrahimi set out to build a website telling the stories of Afghan girls, it wasn't just to give them a voice.",
      "The 17-year-old Afghan refugee was also determined to remind her fellow Gen Zs in her adopted country, Canada, that they were similar - they even listened to Taylor Swift just like other teenage girls around the world.",
      "\"I want to make them as real as possible so that other people, especially young people, Gen Z specifically, can put themselves in their shoes,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Nila spoke to the BBC earlier this week, before picking up the International Children\u2019s Peace Prize previously won by education campaigner Malala Yousafzai and climate activist Greta Thunberg.",
      "Nila's is, perhaps, not an easy task. The plight of Afghanistan's women and girls can feel a world away to young people living in Canada, where Nila found a home after fleeing her home country as the Taliban took over three years ago.",
      "In that time, the Taliban have banned teenage girls from education, banned women from travelling long distances without a male chaperone, and now ordered them to keep their voices down in public - effectively silencing half the population.",
      "The Taliban have defended the rulings to the BBC previously by saying they align with religious texts.",
      "\"The differences [between Afghanistan and Canada] are vast, so it makes it hard for them to feel connected,\" acknowledges Nila.",
      "That is why she helped set up HerStory - a place where she and others help share the stories of Afghan women and girls in their own words, both inside and out of the country.",
      "\"So many times we are lost in the differences that we don't see the similarities and that's our goal, to show that to the world.\"",
      "Nila Ibrahim was chosen from 165 nominees as the 20th winner of the prestigious prize.",
      "The award recognises not just the work done on HerStory, but also her passion for standing up for women's rights in Afghanistan.",
      "Nila's first stand for women's rights came in March 2021, when she joined other young Afghan girls in sharing a video of her singing online.",
      "It was a small but powerful protest against a decree by the then-director of education in the Afghan capital, Kabul, who tried to ban girls over 12 singing in public. The attempted order was never implemented.",
      "\"That was when I really understood the importance of performing, the importance of speaking up and talking about these issues,\" explains Nila, who was part of a group called Sound of Afghanistan.",
      "But less than six months later, everything would change - and, aged 14, she would have to flee with her family as the Taliban arrived.",
      "The family - who are part of Afghanistan's Hazara minority - made the difficult journey to Pakistan, where they spent a year before being granted asylum in Canada.",
      "'If we can't speak, why live?' - BBC meets women after new Taliban law",
      "Taliban defends new law that curbs women's freedoms",
      "'We don't live, we're just alive': Afghan girls despair at Taliban school ban",
      "It was, after 12 months without education, a \"breath of fresh air\", she says.",
      "There, Nila was reunited with her friends from the singing group.",
      "She was also invited to speak at events, about her experiences of Afghanistan, allowing her to advocate for all the girls left behind.",
      "People, she says, were surprised at how eloquent she was. But Nila knew there were millions of women and girls in Afghanistan who were just as capable - although with less access to the opportunities she had.",
      "\"So I thought if my potential can surprise these people and they don't know about how educated girls from Afghanistan can be, what if that information was accessible to them?\"",
      "HerStory - the website which grew out of this thought - started in 2023. It features interviews and first person accounts from both refugees and women inside Afghanistan.",
      "The idea is to create a safe space where a group of people who \"grew up with the stories of the first period of Taliban and how horrible the lives of women were at the time\" share their stories - and their \"shock and anger\" at finding themselves in an increasingly similar situation.",
      "The anger is a feeling Nila tries to keep separate from her work.",
      "\"When you see Afghanistan going back in time in 20 years, of course it makes you fear,\" she says.",
      "\"It's a shared feeling. It's a shared experience for girls anywhere.\"",
      "The award, she says, is a chance for Afghan girls to once again remind the world about the restrictions they face on a daily basis - a reminder \"not to forget Afghan girls\".",
      "Marc Dullaert, founder of the KidsRights Foundation, which runs the award, pointed out that a \"staggering\" number of young women were currently being excluded from education.",
      "\"Nila\u2019s inspirational work to provide them with a voice that will be heard across the world makes her a truly worthy winner of this year\u2019s 20th International Peace Prize,\u201d he added.",
      "It is also a reminder that her generation - while young - can make a difference, Nila hopes.",
      "\"I think so many times when we talk about issues and different causes, we talk about it with the very adult like approach of oh, this is very serious,\" she says.",
      "\"The world is a very scary place, but there is an approach that is more Gen Z-like...  and we can take little steps and... do whatever we can.\"",

    "summary": "Chuck Woolery was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

    "story": [
      "Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, \"Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" has died at age 83.",
      "Guthrie announced the death on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records label.",
      "\"This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,\" Guthrie wrote. \"Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.\"",
      "Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. He did not say what was the cause of death.",
      "Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society, among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts.",
      "Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence.",
      "On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash, but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions.",
      "By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice \u2014whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant\u2014 that countless fans have since memorized:",
      "\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\"",
      "Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of popular culture. \"Alice's Restaurant\" was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name.",
      "Alice Brock would write a memoir, \"My Life as a Restaurant,\" and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, \"Mooses Come Walking.\" At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving.",
      "Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband.",
      "Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in \"Alice's Restaurant\" advised: \"You can get anything you want\" at Alice's Restaurant, \"excepting Alice.\"",

      "\"Well, since 'Gladiator' one, I made 17 big movies. I was quite busy,\" Scott said.",

      "A new hero in the arena",
      "Scott brings a fresh take on the same empire fans loved in the first movie.",
      "In the original film, Russell Crowe played Maximus, a general-turned-gladiator battling for honor. This time, the spotlight is on Irish actor Paul Mescal, who stars as a slave fighting for his freedom in the same empire.",
      "Scott, who studied art before becoming a filmmaker, started crafting the sequel's storyboards before the script was even complete.",
      "\"I'm already thinking \u2026 images. I'm drawing as [the writer] is writing. So when I enter on the set, I've already pre-planned everything,\" Scott said. \"It's very efficient because we did 'Gladiator' in 51 days.\"",
      "The sequel opens with an ambitious attack scene involving three full-scale Roman ships.",
      "\"I'm going to make three full-scale real ships,\" Scott said, explaining how they were mounted on massive industrial movers. \"Each trolley is about 100 feet long.\"",
      "While Scott embraces old-school filmmaking, he's also excited about modern tools like CGI.",
      "While Gladiator II features thrilling battles, Scott says the film also explores timeless themes and reflects on the constants of human nature, cruelty and violence.",
      "\"It reminds you that Rome would have Christians walked into that arena and eaten alive. Men, women, and children\u2014for fun,\" he said. \"What on earth was in the minds of Romans in that particular point? And have we come very far away from that? It's extraordinary that's still happening. We don't learn by history.\"",
      "The challenge of a sequel",
      "At 86, Scott admitted it was daunting to follow up on his original masterpiece. \"In a funny kind of way, I feel like I'm in a sport. It is competitive,\" he said. \"You're fighting yourself and your own fear and your own insecurity.\"",
      "When asked about his favorite part of the movie, Scott said, \"I think I'm relieved it is so embraced. And so I'm the favorite as the whole movie. It's pretty good.\"",

    "story": [
      "After years of personal struggles, Grammy winner Shelby Lynne thought her recording career may be over.",
      "But with the help of some friends, the singer-songwriter released her new album, \"Consequences of the Crown,\" earlier this year, which is her 17th studio album.",
      "Lynne's breakout album \"I am Shelby Lynne\" came after a difficult decision to leave Nashville 25 years ago.",
      "Personal struggles",
      "Lynne, now 56, was 19 when she signed a record deal in Nashville. Her first single was a duet with George Jones.",
      "Despite that early success, Lynne's private life was weighed down by a secret and family tragedy. Coming up in Nashville in the late 1980s, Lynne had to hide the fact that she was gay. She also kept her family history in the shadows. In 1986, she lost both her parents when her father shot and killed her mother and then turned the gun on himself.",
      "The only constant and way to cope for Lynne was music.",
      "\"I think that's why I would turn mean as hell \u2026 just protect, protect, protect. I didn't know what trauma was, or PTSD. I just knew I had to sing,\" Lynne said.",
      "Frustrated with Nashville, Lynne moved to California and changed genres. It worked. In 2000, she made the album that still defines her. \"I Am Shelby Lynne,\" widely considered a soul-pop masterpiece, helped her win a Grammy for best new artist.",
      "Lynne says music \"saved me a hundred times,\" but she struggled with commercial success, sobriety and the legacy of her parents.",
      "\"I mean, now I'm at peace with it, because I love them and it allows me to miss them,\" she said. \"It took me just like a gong in the head going, you know, they did the best they could. They did.\"",
      "Return to Nashville",
      "When Lynne left Nashville, she wasn't planning on coming back. However, after years of living in California, she quietly returned to the South in 2018.",
      "\"To be quite honest, I didn't know if Nashville was mad at me,\" she said.",
      "It's in Nashville where Lynne confronted sobriety and accepted help from friends, something she has never found easy to do.",
      "\"I still got the devil in me, but people like Ashley [Monroe] and Karen [Fairchild] and Gena [Johnson] saved me. They saw me when I was here at my worst and I was really just trying to start over,\" she said.",
      "Songwriters Karen Fairchild of \"Little Big Town\" and Ashley Monroe started writing with Lynne upon her return.",
      "It was Fairchild and Monroe that pushed Lynne to make new music.",
      "\"We kept kind of bugging her about it,\" Fairchild said.",
      "\"'We want a Shelby record,'\" Monroe remembered telling Lynne. \"She's like, 'Nobody wants that.' We do.\"",
      "That persistence paid off.",
      "\"I was so nervous because, I mean, I've held her at the very top of all my lists,\" Monroe said.",
      "Their respect was also matched by their intimidation of working with one of their idols.",
      "\"It's like everybody has this reverence for her,\" Fairchild said of Lynne. \"And also like, there's fear\u2026 because she's a force.\"",
      "Fairchild and Monroe met with Lynne at the studio of engineer Gena Johnson to help create the album. Though hesitant about making new music, with a little help from her friends, Lynne eventually saw it all taking shape.",
      "\"It was on 'Butterfly' when she was like, ready to recognize that was a record coming to life,\" Fairchild said.",

    "summary": "CBS News' Anthony Mason joins Paul Simon on a trip to the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss, to explore how researchers are getting closer to finding answers about repairing and preventing hearing loss.",
    "story": [
      "When legendary singer-songwriter\u00a0Paul Simon began to lose his hearing\u00a0nearly four years ago while working on his album, \"Seven Psalms,\" he feared he wouldn't be able to perform again.",
      "\"It was incredibly frustrating. I was very angry at first that this had happened,\" Simon told CBS News senior culture correspondent\u00a0Anthony Mason\u00a0in an interview for \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "He admits one of his biggest fears was giving up what he loves: making music.",
      "\"I guess what I'm most apprehensive about would be if I can't hear well enough to really enjoy the act of making music,\" Simon said.",
      "Since then, he's had dramatic hearing loss, sharing that he now has about 6% hearing in his left ear. But he's learned to make adjustments. He's switched to larger speakers, placing them all around him when he's playing so he can hear better. He's also had to change how and what he plays.",
      "\"I'm going through my repertoire and reducing a lot of the choices that I make to acoustic versions. It's all much quieter. It's not 'You Can Call Me Al.' That's gone. I can't do that one,\" Simon said, chuckling.",
      "Simon is still writing music and he returned to the stage in September for a rare, stripped-down performance at The Soho Sessions in New York.",
      "\"You know Matisse, when he was suffering at the end of his life, when he was in bed, he envisioned all these cut-outs and had a great creative period,\" Simon said. \"So I don't think creativity stops with disability. So far, I haven't experienced that. And I hope not to.\"",
      "Paul Simon's search for answers",
      "At first, doctors told Simon there was nothing they could do about his hearing loss. Then, he learned about the\u00a0Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss\u00a0(SICHL), which includes a team of nearly 100 scientists searching for ways to prevent, repair and replace damaged inner ear tissue.",
      "That's promising news for Simon and millions like him. Hearing loss is on the rise, affecting nearly 1.5 billion people across the globe, according to Stanford Medicine.",
      "Mason recently joined Simon during a visit to the program's facility in Palo Alto, California, sitting in on Simon's exam with Dr. Konstantina Stankovic.",
      "\"Hearing bones are the smallest bones in the body,\" Dr. Stankovic said. \"And then they are connected to the inner ear, which is called the cochlea. And it looks like a snail.\"",
      "The cochlea is so small and fragile it's impossible to biopsy without causing deafness. It's hidden in the hardest bone in the body, located deep in the skull, Dr. Stankovic explained.",
      "What can animals teach us about hearing loss?",
      "Certain animals can recover from hearing loss because their hair cells regenerate. It's the hairs in the ear, called cilia, that transmit sound to the brain.",
      "\"We actually have the same genetic machinery, it's just turned off in people,\" Dr. Stankovic told Mason. \"And the key question is how do you turn it on? And how do you turn it on safely, because cancer is regeneration gone awry.\"",
      "In a lab at the Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss , geneticist Teresa Nicolson is studying zebrafish, which have similar inner ear structures to humans.",
      "Nicolson said they've made a recent, exciting discovery. They were able to rescue hearing in zebrafish with hearing loss mutations using an FDA-approved drug. The hope is it could one day be used in humans.",
      "Down the hall, biophysicist Tony Ricci is conducting an experiment focused on mice.",
      "\"So the hair bundle is the site where most damage happens. So with aging, with noise\u2026we are trying to understand how the bundle \u2013 like it's a machine, right? So how this machine works normally,\" Ricci said.",
      "\"So then when we know what piece's parts are getting broken, we can figure out how do we fix it or how do we replace it,\" he added.",
      "Surgeon and scientist Dr. Alan Cheng is using gene therapy to coax the damaged hair cells in mice to regenerate. He's also studying human cochlea samples from organ donors.",
      "\"We're the only place in the world that can do it, in fact,\" Dr. Cheng said.",
      "The team was surprised to find that damaged human hair cells do begin to regenerate on their own, but only partially. Now they need to find out whether the drug cocktail they've used in mice could work in humans.",
      "For Dr. Cheng, this research is personal.",
      "\"My mom, who has hearing loss, she's been asking how can we regenerate cells for her,\" he said.",
      "\"That's what I've been asking ever since I met you guys,\" Simon added with a smile.",

    "summary": "When it comes to eating healthy, all of us respond to foods differently. The National Institutes of Health's new nutrition study hopes to finally provide Americans a personalized answer to the question: \"What should I eat?\"",
    "story": [
      "It's been said the best meals come from the heart, not from a recipe book. But at this USDA kitchen, there's no pinch of this, dash of that, no dollops or smidgens of anything. Here, nutritionists in white coats painstakingly measure every single ingredient, down to the tenth of a gram.",
      "Sheryn Stover is expected to eat every crumb of her pizza; any tiny morsels she does miss go back to the kitchen, where they're scrutinized like evidence of some dietary crime.",
      "Stover (or participant #8180, as she's known) is one of some 10,000 volunteers enrolled in a $170 million nutrition study run by the National Institutes of Health. \"At 78, not many people get to do studies that are going to affect a great amount of people, and I thought this was a great opportunity to do that,\" she said.",
      "It's called the Nutrition for Precision Health Study. \"When I tell people about the study, the reaction usually is, 'Oh, that's so cool, can I do it?'\" said coordinator Holly Nicastro.",
      "She explained just what \"precise\" precisely means: \"Precision nutrition means tailoring nutrition or dietary guidance to the individual.\"",
      "The government has long offered guidelines to help us eat better. In the 1940s we had the \"Basic 7.\" In the '50s, the \"Basic 4.\" We've had the \"Food Wheel,\" the \"Food Pyramid,\" and currently, \"My Plate.\"",
      "They're all well-intentioned, except they're all based on averages \u2013 what works best for most people, most of the time. But according to Nicastro, there is no one best way to eat. \"We know from virtually every nutrition study ever conducted, we have inner individual variability,\" she said. \"That means we have some people that are going to respond, and some people that aren't. There's no one-size-fits-all.\"",
      "The study's participants, like Stover, are all being drawn from another NIH study program called All Of Us, a massive undertaking to create a database of at least a million people who are volunteering everything from their electronic health records to their DNA. \u00a0It was from that All of Us research that Stover discovered she has the gene that makes some foods taste bitter, which could explain why she ate more of one kind of food than another.",
      "Professor Sai Das, who oversees the study at Tufts University, says the goal of precision nutrition is to drill down even deeper into those individual differences. \"We're moving away from just saying everybody go do this, to being able to say, 'Okay, if you have X, Y and Z characteristics, then you're more likely to respond to a diet, and somebody else that has A, B and C characteristics will be responding to the diet differently,'\" Das said.",
      "It's a big commitment for Stover, who is one of 150 people being paid to live at a handful of test sites around the country for six weeks \u2013 two weeks at a time. It's so precise she can't even go for a walk without a dietary chaperone. \"Well, you could stop and buy candy \u2026 God forbid, you can't do that!\" she laughed.",
      "While she's here, everything from her resting metabolic rate, her body fat percentage, her bone mineral content, even the microbes in her gut (digested by a machine that essentially is a smart toilet paper reading device) are being analyzed for how hers may differ from someone else's.",
      "Nicastro said, \"We really think that what's going on in your poop is going to tell us a lot of information about your health and how you respond to food.\"",
      "Stover says she doesn't mind, except for the odd sounds the machine makes. While she is a live-in participant, thousands of others are participating from their homes, where electronic wearables track all kinds of health data, including special glasses that record everything they eat, activated when someone starts chewing. Artificial intelligence can then be used to determine not only which foods the person is eating, but how many calories are consumed.",
      "This study is expected to be wrapped up by 2027, and because of it, we may indeed know not only to eat more fruits and vegetables, but what combination of foods is really best for us. \u00a0The question that even Holly Nicastro can't answer is, will we listen? \"You can lead a horse to water; you can't make them drink,\" she said. \"We can tailor the interventions all day. But one hypothesis I have is that if the guidance is tailored to the individual, it's going to make that individual more likely to follow it, because this is for me, this was designed for me.\"",

      "The proposed crackdown, which is still in its early stages and will need to get a sign-off from Trump and his transition team, targets a provision in the FDA's regulations on which food additives are considered by the agency to be \"generally recognized as safe,\" or GRAS.",
      "Advisers to Kennedy, Trump's pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, have also floated other approaches to curbing the use of food additives, including working with agricultural producers to change the subsidies and incentives offered by the government for certain kinds of foods Kennedy argues are unhealthy.",
      "\"I think the overall posture of the FDA should be actually a lot of deregulation. I think we should have a golden age of innovation and drug development. Nobody's standing in the way of that,\" Calley Means, a top adviser to Kennedy's transition team, said this month on \"The Liz Wheeler Show.\"",
      "Means said \"corrupt regulatory interpretations\" had broken the regulation of additives under the GRAS process, saying it had become a \"totally rigged system.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to food, when it comes to 'generally recognized as safe,' complete self-policing from this industry, allowing them to put chemicals in our food that are banned in every other country and have hundreds of studies saying are harmful, there needs to be a review,\" Means said.",
      "\"This is a bananas system\"",
      "Advocacy groups and experts have long denounced the FDA's \"loophole\" in its regulation of these food additives, which allows companies to quietly decide which chemicals they deem safe enough to add to their products without going through the agency's oversight.",
      "\"This is a bananas system. This is not the way that new food chemicals should be approved and come into our food supply,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "While companies with new chemicals can choose to go through a \"voluntary\" process to earn a spot on the agency's list of substances that are \"generally recognized as safe,\" making it easier to market foods with the additives, officials acknowledge companies often bypass it.",
      "\"It does undermine the overall credibility of the system when it is possible to get a chemical on the market without prior review by the FDA,\" the agency's top food official, Jim Jones, said at an event hosted by the Alliance for a Stronger FDA earlier this year.",
      "Bill Freese, science director for the Center for Food Safety, cited times companies have decided to go ahead and \"self-certify\" that their food additives were safe, even after failing to earn the sign-off of the FDA's reviewers during the voluntary process.",
      "That has strayed far from the original intent of the provision, Freese said, which was supposed to narrowly \"grandfather in\" foods with a long history of safe use like salt and vinegar.",
      "\"These GRAS exemptions should be limited. The FDA just expanded the loophole until it just literally swallowed the entire statute,\" he said.",
      "Obstacles in Congress and the courts",
      "Making it mandatory for companies to go through the GRAS notification process before using any new food ingredients will likely face hurdles.",
      "Cracking down on food additives would dramatically broaden the FDA's workload. The agency would have to both screen new notifications as well as look back at previously greenlighted chemicals.",
      "FDA officials have long called for Congress to step up funding for oversight of food additives, warning that resources were stretched thin even with the current duties.",
      "One idea to broaden FDA's funding \u2014 attaching fees to applications submitted by food manufacturers, similar to the \"user fees\" programs for medical products \u2014 has also failed to gain traction on Capitol Hill. Kennedy has also been critical of the \"user fees\" approach for drugs, and has called to undo it.",
      "Another obstacle could come through the courts, especially in light of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that curtailed agency power.",
      "Advocacy groups lost a previous federal lawsuit against the FDA trying to require the notifications back in 2021. In that case, the judge found that \"it remains unclear under the statute whether FDA even has the authority to make GRAS notifications mandatory.\"",
      "\"I think there are certainly things within FDA's power to narrow the loophole, to make it harder for companies to take advantage of the GRAS process. But there is some legal precedence saying that this is Congress' problem to fix, so we'll just have to see,\" said Benesh.",
      "While Kennedy's team acknowledges the issue may end up needing to be hashed out through legislation on Capitol Hill, changing the procedure solely through the executive branch is on the table, an adviser said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said he is asking Trump to \"declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease\" as another way to supercharge his authorities amid blowback they expect from the food industry.",
      "\"This is not a monolithic, this is not an all-powerful industry. They can be disrupted. So that's what gives me hope. The voters and President Trump's microphone are on our side,\" Means said.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group representing several large food companies Kennedy has criticized like cereal maker WK Kellogg and soft drink company Coca Cola, said in a statement that keeping consumers \"safe is our number one priority.\"",
      "\"The federal regulatory agencies within HHS operate under a science and risk-based mandate and it is critical that framework remains under the new administration,\" Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of federal affairs for the association, said in a statement.",
      "Gallo has\u00a0previously said the food industry would be open to the FDA taking a more proactive role, in hopes of negating \"the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures that have stepped in to ban some additives.",
      "\"As the largest domestic manufacturing employer, supporting more than 22 million American jobs, we are prepared to work with the confirmed appointee and qualified experts within HHS to support public health, build consumer trust and promote consumer choice,\" Gallo said.",

    "story": [
      "Nationwide rates of emergency room visits for babies with Mycoplasma pneumoniae are on track to surpass rates for school-age children, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, as doctors nationwide are grappling with a surge of \"walking pneumonia\" cases.",
      "The new figures come from the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, which gathers data on pneumonia-associated emergency room visits from U.S. hospitals.",
      "While cases had been higher in school-age kids compared to other age groups, rates in babies have surged in recent weeks, and are now tied with older kids. According to the latest CDC data, for the week ending Nov. 2, 7.6% of emergency department pneumonia cases for babies 0-1 years old and children ages 5-17 years old resulted in Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnoses.",
      "\"These diagnoses dropped a little after August, but remained high through early November. Of note, diagnoses among 0\u20131-year-olds have steadily increased throughout the fall without any subsequent decrease,\" CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, cases largely disappeared. CDC officials had said that this year's wave could be heralding a return to waves of Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases that occurred prior to the pandemic.",
      "But this year's trend has also been unusual, since cases had previously been thought to be common only in school-aged kids, not younger children.",
      "\"While we are seeing right now that it is presenting as a typical respiratory infection, we want to make sure that there isn't something unusual going on with the bacteria itself or the way it's showing up that might give guidance in how to treat and prevent it,\" Dr. Adam Cohen, head of the CDC's pneumonia branch, told Medscape News earlier this month.",
      "According to Reed, while every U.S. region is seeing an increase in Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, the CDC's data suggests that since at least last month \u2014 when several states first began to raise concerns over the surge \u2014 the ERs of three regions specifically are seeing the highest levels of the bacteria.",
      "One is in the South and spans Texas and its neighbors Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The second is in the Midwest and includes Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska. The third is in the Northeast and includes New York and New Jersey.",
      "\"Maybe it's another one of those things that we didn't see, got really suppressed during COVID, and now it's coming back,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, division chief of pediatric infectious disease at Golisano Children's Hospital in New York. \"It just is definitely a really bad year for Mycoplasma.\"",
      "Nayak said that around a quarter of tests from the hospital's microbiology lab have come in positive for the bacteria, which she says is unusually high.",
      "The hospital has also seen an increase in patients needing to be hospitalized for the bacteria and who are battling a range of conditions \u2014 from lung issues to more complicated neurological complications \u2014 though they remain a fraction of overall cases.",
      "\"We've definitely seen more kids on the seriously ill side of the spectrum,\" Nayak said. \"Likely not because the bacteria has changed, but because our rates overall are just higher.\"",
      "She cautioned that while the recent increase has been unusual, there has not been a lot of data tracking the disease, so comparisons to previous waves of the bacteria have been challenging.",
      "\"Our tracking of Mycoplasma infections is suboptimal,\" Nayak said. \"This is not something that is reportable to health departments. It has not, until relatively recently, been closely tracked.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health said that it has also tracked a \"marked increase\" in Mycoplasma pneumoniae based on data from the state's emergency rooms, compared to previous years.",
      "While not all pneumonia cases warrant antibiotics, Nayak said testing can be important to give answers for children and their families battling persistent or serious pneumonia cases, as well as to help make decisions about how to treat the infections.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",
      "Closely watching for human cases",
      "Confirmation of the infected flock in Hawaii follows a detection of the virus in the area from wastewater samples collected by the state earlier this month.",
      "Health officials around the country have been closely watching for signs of H5N1 spreading in their communities amid mounting cases in humans across North America.",
      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",
      "Experts say the virus that infected the teenager does appear to have some worrying mutations, which might explain why the case was more severe.",
      "\"The preliminary sequence from the H5N1 human case in British Columbia has been posted and it is not good news,\" Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, posted on Nov. 16.",
      "Genetic sequencing data from human cases so far in the U.S. have not found any signs of the virus mutating to spread more efficiently between humans or to be significantly more dangerous, the CDC says.",
      "But the agency also recently found evidence that several cases had been asymptomatic and gone undetected during the outbreak so far, prompting stepped up testing recommendations.",

In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",

      "In response to a question about guidance for average consumers, the company wrote: \"Our tool is designed to be user-friendly. Average consumers can easily upload an audio file on our website or use our browser extension to analyze content directly. The tool will provide an analysis to help determine if a video may contain deepfake elements using probabilities, making it accessible even for those unfamiliar with AI technology.\"",

The site offers a free service, but it also has a paid tier, where consumers can adjust settings and calibrations for more in-depth analysis.",
      "While he acknowledges that Attestiv isn't perfect, Vekiarides said that as deepfakes become harder to spot with the naked eye, these kinds of websites are needed as part of the solution.",
      "\"Our tool can determine if something is suspicious, and then you can verify it with your own eyes to say, 'I do think that's suspicious,'\" Vekiarides said.",
      "DeepFake-O-Meter",

      "In an email, the creator of the open platform said a limitation of deepfake detection models is that video compression can lead to sync issues with video and audio and inconsistent mouth movements.",
      "In response to a question about how everyday users can use the tool, the company emailed: \"Currently, the main result shown to users is the probability value of this sample being a generated sample across different detection models. This can be used as a reference if multiple models agree on the same answer with confidence (e.g., over 80% for AI-generated or below 20% for real video).

      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

    "summary": "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza \u2014 also known as bird flu \u2014 is killing layer hens and reducing the nation's egg supply.",
    "story": [
      "Americans planning to do some holiday baking this year may have to scramble to track down a key ingredient.",
      "Some stores around the U.S. are running short of eggs, especially those operating in states that require eggs from cage-free hens, as cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) flare and the virus spreads from wild birds to commercial flocks. More than 40% of the nation's roughly 300 million egg-laying hens are raised in cage-free facilities, but roughly 60% of \"bird flu\" cases recently detected involved cage-free farms.",
      "\"After two months of no outbreaks, we had them recently in Utah, Oregon, California and Washington, and three of those states are exclusively cage-free,\" Emily Metz, chief executive and president of the American Egg Board, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Where we are hearing reports of shortages it's at stores like a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.\"",
      "After a brief respite from bird flu among commercial-egg producers, HPAI struck again starting in mid-October, resulting in the loss of 2.8 million birds. The nation's egg production fell 2.6% last month from a year ago and is projected to be down 1% this year versus 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service recently said in a monthly\u00a0report.",
      "The outbreaks, which began in January of 2022, have affected nearly 110 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, including wild, commercial and backyard flocks in 49 states, according\u00a0to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the first time HPAI, also known as H5N1,\u00a0had been detected in the U.S. since 2016.",
      "The return of bird flu is wiping out poultry populations at commercial facilities in multiple states, most recently striking more than a million egg-laying hens in California's Kern County, where HPAI had been confirmed in 2.2 million egg-laying hens the prior week, according\u00a0to\u00a0the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "More than 790,000 egg layers were also culled last week at a commercial operation in Arizona's Pinal County.",
      "How long do shortages last?",
      "The tighter egg supplies means the U.S. is experiencing \"hyper-localized shortages that are very temporary and intermittent and that are corrected sometimes within a day,\" said Metz, whose board markets and promotes eggs and egg products.",
      "\"There are local areas where supplies aren't quite as strong, so you might see pockets where shelves get picked over,\" said Brent Nelson, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "After HPAI-related shortages drove up egg prices in the spring, the virus is having the same impact this winter. Experts forecast that egg prices could stay elevated for the rest of the year and into 2025.",
      "As with the cost of other commodities, egg prices fluctuate with supply and demand, the latter of which has remained fairly stable over the year, regardless of cost, according to the Farm Bureau's Nelson. The egg board, however, said America's appetite for the protein has grown of late, rising steadily for 20 consecutive quarters.",
      "\"We see egg prices ride the wave as bird flu comes and goes,\" Nelson said. Right now, \"Bird flu infections are by far the biggest factor impacting egg prices.\"",
      "The national average for a dozen eggs is $3.37, up 30% from a year ago but lower than the January 2023 average of $4.82, the economist said. But some regions are seeing even higher prices. In California, white cage-free eggs were selling for about $5.26 a dozen last week \u2014 up nearly 90% from $2.81 during the same time in 2023, according to the USDA.",
      "Despite the price spikes, Nelson and Metz advised consumers against hoarding a perishable product like eggs, emphasizing that shortages typically pass quickly as retailers replenish their supplies.",
      "\"Eggs keep in the fridge really well \u2014 if you need them, go and get them,\" said Nelson.",
      "Added Metz, \"There is a hen for almost every person in the U.S., if they are not in the supermarket today, come back tomorrow.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 15:39:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday said it will consider the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund, agreeing to review a lower court decision that upended the mechanism for funding programs that provide communications services to rural areas, low-income communities and schools, libraries and hospitals.",
      "The dispute is the latest in which the high court will consider the power of federal agencies. Among the issues in the case is whether Congress delegated too much authority to the FCC when it tasked the agency with determining how much telecommunications providers must contribute to the Universal Service Fund. The court also asked the lawyers involved in the case to argue whether it is moot because the challengers did not seek preliminary relief before the lower court.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority has in a string of recent decisions taken aim at federal regulatory power amid efforts by the conservative legal movement to rein in the so-called administrative state. In a major ruling in June, the court overruled a 40-year-old decision that said courts should give agencies leeway in interpreting ambiguous laws passed by Congress if their interpretation is reasonable.",
      "Arguments in this dispute will likely take place early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "The Universal Service Fund was created by Congress in 1996 as part of an overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, which sought to promote competition and get rid of monopolies in the telecommunications industry. Under the revamped law, the FCC created a set of programs supported by the Universal Service Fund that require contributions from telecommunications providers.",
      "Those programs ensure schools, libraries, rural health care facilities and rural and low-income customers have access to telecommunications services, and the FCC uses the money in the fund to subsidize the provision of telephone and broadband services.",
      "Quarterly contributions to the fund are based on projected expenses the programs will incur, as well as projected revenue from telecommunications carriers, a number that is known as the contribution factor. Companies may pass the cost of their contributions on to consumers.",
      "In 1997, the FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private, not-for-profit corporation that administers the fund. The company sends out bills and collects contributions from service providers, and disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "In late 2021, the company proposed each carrier would contribute to the fund 25.2% of its interstate and international telecommunications revenue for the first quarter of November 2022. But a nonprofit called Consumers' Research, telecommunications company, and group of consumers filed a comment challenging the contribution mechanism, arguing Congress had unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC, which in turn redelegated power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. They then sought review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges rejected the group's claim that Congress and then the FCC had unconstitutionally delegated their authority.",
      "But the full complement of judges on the 5th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and in a July decision, sided with the challengers in a 9-7 vote. It found that when carriers seek reimbursements of their fund contributions from consumers, they are levying a \"universal service\" tax on consumers that appears on their phone bills.",
      "The power to tax is a legislative power, and the 5th Circuit's majority found that Congress gave the FCC too much discretion in determining the amount of universal service contributions. It also ruled that the FCC, in turn, \"may have impermissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.\"",
      "\"American telecommunications consumers are subject to a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of that tax is de facto determined by a trade group staffed by industry insiders with no semblance of accountability to the public. And the trade group in turn relies on projections made by its private, for-profit constituent companies, all of which stand to profit from every single tax increase,\" the 5th Circuit found, adding the \"combination of delegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends\" the Constitution.",
      "The 5th Circuit's decision set off a wave of pushback from the telecommunications industry, which warned it would hamper efforts to close the digital divide.",
      "A group of telecommunications trade groups said the ruling \"could put at risk the availability and affordability of essential communications services for millions of rural Americans, low-income consumers, and community anchor institutions.\"",
      "Before the 5th Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court turned down two appeals from Consumers' Research of decisions from the 6th and 11th Circuits that rejected its challenges to the Universal Service Fund. But following the 5th Circuit's decision, the group urged the Supreme Court to reconsider its appeals. The court has not acted on those requests.",

    "summary": "Women report encountering a wide range of biases unrelated to performance or experience that can stunt their careers, new research finds.",
    "story": [
      "It's well-documented that women in the workplace often face biases when seeking leadership roles, but new research is uncovering just how pervasive and wide-ranging those prejudices can be.",
      "In the working world, women leaders report experiencing 30 types of identity factors that discriminate on everything from their body size to marital status, according to new\u00a0research from Wilson College chief information officer Amy Diehl, Westmont College dean Leanne Dzubinski and Clarkson University professor Amber Stephenson published in the peer-reviewed Human Resource Development Quarterly.",
      "The findings stem from the trio's 2023 research into age discrimination. That work, published in the Harvard Business Review, found that women in the workplace\u00a0face bias\u00a0regardless of their age, with their superiors often viewing them as too inexperienced if they are young and too unworthy of promotion if they are older. The new study surveyed more than 900 women in leadership roles in four industries where women comprise a large share of the workforce \u2014 health care, higher education, law and faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"Surprised and shocked\"",
      "\"The way we phrased the question was, 'Tell us about any other identity factors that are impacting your experience'\" in the workforce, Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We thought there would be age and race. We were surprised and shocked when we looked through the data and came up with 30.\"",
      "It's telling that the factors focus on personal qualities like class, marital status and sexual orientation, rather than professional qualifications or skills, underscoring that these biases aren't relevant to whether a woman can perform in the workplace, the researchers said.",
      "\"There is always an excuse masquerading as a reason given for a women about why she's not quite right for any role,\" noted Dzubinski.",

      "Stumbling on the broken rung",
      "While the new research focuses on women in their 40s and 50s who have already reached leadership roles, younger women are more likely to be held back by the so-called broken rung, or when women fail to get a promotion out of entry-level jobs at the same rate as men, research from consulting firm McKinsey and LeanIn, the nonprofit started by former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, has found.",
      "Their research found bias may play a role in stunting women's careers, with young men often promoted on their potential while young women are judged more on their track records.",
      "The new research on bias encountered by women in leadership roles didn't examine how women coped with bias as they climbed the professional ladder, although Diehl noted that women who rise into senior positions tend to \"have a thick skin,\" and might use techniques such as diverting conversations away from identity issues when they arise.",
      "Bias from other women",
      "The researchers focused on four industries where workers are either split equally between men and women or are female-dominated, although the top leadership positions in all these fields are typically held by men. The goal, in short, was also to examine the impact of gender bias in industries not dominated by men.",
      "The women leaders who responded to the survey were college presidents, vice presidents and provosts within higher education; physicians and physician administrators in health care; lawyers and partners within the legal field; and women who hold top leadership roles in faith-based nonprofits.",
      "\"If you have women well represented in the industry, we're still seeing that women are still experiencing various types of bias,\" Stephenson said. \"It's a very real and very embedded situation within any workplace\" regardless of gender composition.",
      "Dzubinski added, \"It used to be the argument that as soon as you get more women in, it would fix itself \u2014 it's not fixing itself.\"",
      "Women can internalize bias and express it against other women in their workplace, while some might believe that there's not enough room at the top for more than a few women, the researchers noted. That can lead to the belief the only way to ascend into leadership roles is if another woman loses her spot, they said.",
      "Can you combat workplace bias?",
      "It's difficult for women to fight such biases, given that others may judge women negatively regardless of their situation, such as whether they are married or unmarried, both of which can trigger prejudices, the research noted.",
      "\"Notice that they are contradictions \u2014 if you are married, that's a problem, or if you aren't married that's a problem,\" Dzubinski told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you put them together you see that they are made up excuses\" to justify why women don't deserve promotions.",
      "While difficult, women should try not to take identity-based criticism personally, Diehl said.",
      "\"It feels very much, 'It's about me,' but it really isn't. It's about larger, systematic gender bias that's trying to force them out of the workplace or into supporting roles, and not leadership roles,\" she said.",
      "Organizations can deal with some of these issues by going over their practices and checking whether these identity factors are playing a role in whether people receive or are denied promotions, the researchers said. Another tool is to use a \"flip it\" strategy, applying the same statement about a woman to a man, such as \"John can't take on this role because he just had a child',\" they noted.",
      "With an onling push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives (DEI) from conservative lawmakers, some companies are dropping their investment in DEI. That could pick up speed under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he'll do more to remove these policies in his next term, while Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's handbook for the next conservative White House, proposes removing all federal rules and programs around DEI.",
      "But rooting out bias can help organizations perform better, the researchers noted.",
      "\"When woman after woman is dealing with all this stuff day after day, it takes time away from them doing their actual job,\" Diehl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hurting the organization in terms of the amount of quality work they can get to.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed Facebook's appeal of a lower court order reviving a shareholder lawsuit brought against the social media giant in light of consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's 2015 misuse of millions of Facebook users' data.",
      "In its first opinion of the term, the high court issued a one-line unsigned decision dismissing Facebook's appeal. The court's ruling indicates it believes it should not have taken up the case, though the Supreme Court did not explain its reasoning.",
      "In tossing the appeal, the Supreme Court leaves in place a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in favor of Facebook shareholders. They had filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Facebook for allegedly misleading them in financial filings about the risks stemming from the massive data breach by Cambridge Analytica.",
      "The case involved what information publicly traded companies must disclose in the \"risk factors\" section of their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and specifically, whether they're obligated to share risks that materialized in the past, even if those events don't present ongoing or future business harm.",
      "The dispute stems from a class action lawsuit that arose out of the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook user data in 2015. Cambridge Analytica had purchased data collected through a personality quiz on Facebook and used it to create psychological profiles of U.S. voters to assist GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "While Cambridge Analytica said in the wake of the scandal that it deleted the data from Facebook, it was reported in 2018 that the firm had lied. Instead, it kept the information and used it to help then-candidate Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016.",
      "Facebook's stock price was not impacted after Cambridge Analytica's misuse of user data was revealed in 2015. But it plummeted in early 2018 after the consulting firm's ongoing misuse of Facebook data for the Trump campaign came to light.",
      "A group of investors who bought Facebook stock between February 2017 and July 2018 swiftly sued the tech giant in federal court, alleging the company's statements in the risk factors section of its 2016 10-K filing were misleading.",
      "In its filing, Facebook warned that \"security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\" The investors alleged the statements were inaccurate because they framed the risk of data misuse by third parties as hypothetical \u2014 even though Cambridge Analytica had improperly used data from Facebook members.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the claims, finding in part that the challenged statements weren't false because \"the Cambridge Analytica scandal was [not] harming Facebook's reputation, business or competitive position\" when the company filed its 2016 risk disclosure.",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled for the shareholders and allowed their case to proceed, finding they adequately alleged Facebook's risk disclosures were misleading because the company \"represented the risk of improper access to or disclosure of Facebook user data as purely hypothetical when that risk had already transpired.\"",
      "Facebook then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the 9th Circuit's decision imposes \"expansive risk-disclosure requirements that will force public companies to inform investors of past incidents that pose no known threat to the business.\"",
      "The company also noted that there is a split among the federal courts of appeals as to what companies have to disclose on their SEC filings. One, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, doesn't require firms to disclose any past events in their risk factors, while other appeals courts require such disclosures only if the company knows the prior events will harm their business.",
      "Facebook said that the 9th Circuit's rule would open the door to lawsuits alleging \"fraud-by-hindsight\" and make risk disclosures burdensome to companies and less useful to investors as they seek to avoid liability.",
      "The Biden administration backed the shareholders in the case, arguing that \"it is plainly misleading to characterize an adverse event that has already materialized as a merely hypothetical future risk.\"",

    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",

Trump's tariffs could cause a typical family's annual grocery budget in 2025 to swell by almost $200 next year, which would amount to an increase of more than 3%, according to Third Way.",
      "\"Prices are absolutely going to rise, because the added costs from increased tariffs will be paid by the consumer,\" Gabe Horwitz, senior vice president for the economic program at Third Way, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those price increases are going to be a lot harder for folks lower down on the income scale.\"",
      "Third Way has been supportive of President Joe Biden's economic policies and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the election.",
      "Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, who is set to be his White House Press secretary, \u00a0disputed the claim that President-elect Trump's policies will boost inflation.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy,\" she said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "To be sure, the timing and magnitude of any new tariffs imposed once Trump takes office is unclear. Brian Peck, adjunct assistant professor of international trade law at USC, recently told CBS News that the new administration could instead use tariffs chiefly as a tool for negotiating leverage in trade talks.",
      "\"If he doesn't like a certain practice or policy initiative, he can use it as leverage to threaten them,\" Peck told CBS News' Carter Evans.",
      "Tariffs are considered a regressive form of taxation, meaning they hit the lowest-income consumers the hardest. That's because low-income families spend a larger share of their budgets on essentials like groceries, versus higher-income earners.",
      "Horwitz and a team of economists put together an approximation of what an average family of four might buy each week at the supermarket, noting that there can be a lot of variation from one family to another. Researchers\u00a0 compared current average prices of\u00a0 groceries with their potential costs if Trump follows through with his proposal for adding tariffs to all imports.",
      "\"We wanted to look specifically at what the tariffs could mean for family budgets,\" Horwitz said.",
      "How much more could groceries cost?",
      "Researchers assumed a weekly trip to the grocery store would include buying coffee, beer, shrimp, beef, bananas, avocados, jam and olive oil.",
      "While these might not be typical purchases for all families, researchers focused on regularly consumed goods for which the U.S. relies heavily on imports, or does not produce domestically at all.",
      "Trump's tariffs would likely cause families to spend at least $3.57 more on such groceries each week, adding up to an additional $185 per year, or an increase of 3.3%, according to the Third Way analysis. The price hikes would apply to each of the eight items on the sample grocery list.",
      "Big-box store prices",
      "Consumers could also end up paying more for items bought less frequently at big-box retail stores like Walmart and Target, Third Way found.",
      "One U.S. company is already responding to the proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden says it plans to import fewer goods made in China to the U.S., and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "\"We have been planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly,\" CEO Edward Rosenfeld told analysts on a recent earnings call. \"We've worked hard over a multiyear period to develop our factory base and our sourcing capability in alternative countries, like Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, etc.\"",
      "Families could end up paying an additional $551 per year at big-box stores, with their spending rising 14% from $3,754 to $4,305, according to Third Way's research.",
      "Big-box store purchases would rise more dramatically in cost because more goods sold at these types of stores are imported from China.",
      "\"If you take Trump at his word, the sheer cost of tariffs for low-income families is astronomical,\" Horwitz said.",
      "Imposing steep new tariffs on other countries could raise economic costs in another way \u2014 by inviting tit-for-tat levies on U.S. exports. Oxford Economics on Thursday forecast that the Trump administration would impose blanket tariffs of 30% on all Chinese imports and that Beijing would retaliate.",
      "\"Tariffs are a two-way street, and the more aggressive tariffs on China will lead to a larger retaliation,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"We assume China will impose 25% tariffs on all U.S. exports, though with exemptions for electronic products.\"",
      "Oxford also expects the U.S. to hit Japan with 10% on metals and cars, leading to reciprocal tariffs on the same U.S. exports.",

      "As of 11:02 a.m. ET, bitcoin traded at $96,747 after rising as high as $98,349 according to CoinDesk.",
      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",

      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:07:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy say the Department of Government Efficiency has targets in mind for cost cutting.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are sharing details about how their newly created Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 which isn't an official government department \u2014 plans to take aim at paring federal spending, with the two writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Wednesday that they are aiming to cut $500 billion in annual spending.",
      "The announcement of DOGE has raised a host of questions, from whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal spending, typically controlled by Congress, as well as the group's powers and how it will operate. Musk and Ramaswamy provided answers to some of those questions in their opinion piece, arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress.",
      "While Musk and Ramaswamy said they \"expect to prevail\" in cutting costs, there have been plenty of examples throughout the decades of efforts aimed at reining in federal spending, which have had only limited results. For instance, President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s tapped businessman J. Peter Grace to recommend reforms, resulting in about 2,500 recommendations for cutting spending, most of which were never implemented.",
      "Musk has suggested slicing $2 trillion in annual federal spending, an amount experts say is unrealistic given that most of the nation's $6.7 trillion in yearly outlays is spent on Social Security, Medicare and the military.",
      "But in the Wednesday opinion piece, Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that their initial aim will be to cut \"the $500 billion plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Where will Musk's DOGE aim to cut federal spending?",
      "Two-thirds of federal spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "But as mentioned above, Musk and Ramaswamy said they'll target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs they believe aren't in line with lawmakers' intentions.",
      "The biggest source of expired authorizations sits with health care for veterans, which cost $119 billion in fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "However, Musk and Ramaswamy didn't single out veterans' health care as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they listed the following areas:",
      "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives $535 million a year\u00a0International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grantsPlanned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",

      "International organizations that receive $1.5 billion in grants",
      "Planned Parenthood and what they describe as \"progressive groups\" that receive almost $300 million per year",
      "Which federal programs don't have authorization?",
      "The programs mentioned by Musk and Ramaswamy are relatively tiny compared with other areas that are unauthorized, such as veterans' health care.",
      "The next biggest sources of expired authorizations, after veterans' health care, include programs that invest in opioid treatment, the State Department and housing assistance. Some smaller programs with expired funding include Head Start, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. The latter provides weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.",
      "According to Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that was developed by the Heritage Foundation to guide the next conservative White House, the NOAA \"should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated.\"",
      "DOGE wants to cut federal workers. Here's how.",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy also underscored that they'll push to cut the ranks of federal employees, saying their efforts could lead to \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.\" The pair didn't enumerate the number of workers they'll seek to push out of the federal workforce.",
      "In 2023, there were more than 2 million federal employees, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group focused on the federal government. Most of those workers are within Veterans Affairs, due to a large number of health care providers for the VA, followed by people enlisted in the armed services, its data shows.",
      "While civil service workers have job protections, Musk and Ramaswamy argued that the president would be legally allowed to enact \"reductions in force\" that don't target specific workers, as well as to make decisions including \"large-scale firings to relocation of federal agencies out of the Washington area.\"",
      "The DOGE would help federal employees \"transition into the private sector,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote. \"The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit.\"",
      "The pair also said they want to require federal workers to be in the office five days a week, a policy change that they predict would \"result in a wave of voluntary terminations.\"",
      "In a Thursday post on X, the social media service owned by Elon Musk, the DOGE wrote, \"Federal government agencies are using, on average, just 12% of the space in their DC headquarters.  The Department of Agriculture, with space for more than 7,400 people, averaged 456 workers each day (6% occupancy).\"",
      "It added, \"Why are American taxpayer dollars being spent to maintain empty buildings?\"",
      "How much do federal workers earn?",
      "Pay varies by department and seniority, with the federal government publishing a General Schedule of basic pay grades for most federal employees. For 2024, the lowest pay grade was about $22,000 in annual earnings, while the highest was about $160,000. Some agencies offer competitive salaries to compete with the private sector. Pay may also vary by location.",
      "Federal employees are located in every state, with 80% located outside the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "Workers at the Administrative Conference of the United States, an independent federal agency charged with identifying improvements for federal agencies to protect public interests, have the highest median salary, at about $242,000, according to federal data. That's followed by employees at the American Battle Monuments Commission, with a median salary of about $228,000.",

      "Around 13,140 had been reported by health departments around this time last year and 12,119 were reported by this time in 2019.",
      "Foodborne illnesses linked to other germs have also climbed across the country in recent years, reports by the CDC's FoodNet system suggest, though improvements in how patients are tested for these germs may help explain some of the increase.",
      "\"Laboratory technology changes and that impacts what we see in the surveillance data. When laboratory testing gets faster, it gets more specific, it gets better in other ways. It makes the data a little bit less comparable,\" Sharon Shea, senior director of food safety at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "Shea, who has also worked as a microbiologist in hospital laboratories as well as public health labs, said other ways that public health departments and doctors respond to foodborne outbreaks have gotten better as well.",
      "Some of that is a time-saving shift towards \"molecular-based\" panel tests that can be run by hospitals and clinical labs for an array of germs, instead of one-off tests for specific pathogens, that were rolled out after 2012.",
      "Labs in the PulseNet network helmed by the CDC have also switched to \"whole genome sequencing,\" Shea said \u2014 a more accurate approach to narrowing down the unique genetic fingerprint that can link different cases together for investigators. Those connections can be crucial for uncovering common foods eaten by sick people in an outbreak.",
      "\"The most preventable, needless deaths\"",
      "Food safety advocates outside the government say the U.S. still has plenty of room for improvement in food safety.",
      "\"It doesn't help to say 'Americans have the safest food in the world' when people are dying from baby carrots,\" said Sarah Sorscher, head of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Sorscher acknowledged that public health departments have gotten better at investigating outbreaks, but cautioned that still only a fraction of foodborne illnesses are solved.",
      "\"Our public health system is getting better at solving outbreaks thanks to advances in whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence, so it may be that we are just seeing more of the iceberg now than we did a few years ago,\" she said.",
      "Staffing shortages and breakdowns in food safety had also led to an artificial dip in the number of recalls and reported illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sorscher said.",
      "\"Our food supply is not as safe as it was even five years ago. Anyone who's gone to the grocery store or rifled through their refrigerator to see which onions and carrots in the produce drawer are the subject of the latest recall knows that,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government relations at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Faber pointed to a previous report tracking a rebound in food recalls after 2020, based on data from the FDA as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Inspections by the FDA of food facilities are falling short of a congressional mandate, the Environmental Working Group has argued. They have also criticized the agency for not requiring testing of irrigation water sprayed on crops, which can pose a contamination risk from nearby animal feeding operations.",
      "\"Not unlike washing your hands or not cutting your vegetables on the same cutting board as your chicken, they're just common sense measures to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. And these are the most preventable, needless deaths imaginable,\" said Faber.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Nov 2024 15:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Some voters are hoping President-elect Donald Trump may send out another stimulus check. Here's what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump in his first term as president sent out two stimulus checks to millions of Americans during the pandemic, part of the federal government's goal of keeping consumers financially afloat during the crisis. Now, some social media posts are claiming that Trump, once he takes office next year, may issue another check \u2014 a likelihood that experts say is extremely slim.",
      "Posts on TikTok are suggesting Trump might issue another round of checks, while on X, some users are questioning if they're in line for a payment.",
      "When the COVID-19 health emergency shuttered the economy in 2020, millions of Americans lost their jobs, sending the jobless rate to almost 15% and causing financial hardship for many. As a result, Trump signed two bills that sent stimulus checks to eligible households, while President Biden authorized a third.",
      "Even though many Americans feel the economy is faring badly, with some pointing to the impact of the pandemic's high inflation, the U.S. isn't anywhere close to the situation of the early 2020s, economists say.",
      "\"Stimulus checks typically only happen when the economy is in really bad shape and consumers need a push to start spending money again,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's not really the case in the present.\"",
      "Is the economy bad enough for a new stimulus check?",
      "While a majority of Americans give the economy poor ratings, economists say that it's in good shape overall, with solid GDP growth, inflation that is inching closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal and a jobless rate of 4.1% \u2014 which is near a 50-year low.",
      "\"Despite some pain points and general 'bad vibes' expressed by some people, the economy is currently in remarkably good shape and consumer spending is relatively strong,\" Channel said.",
      "Even so, many inflation-weary consumers say they haven't yet seen the benefit of that growth. The November 5 presidential election was viewed as a mandate from voters for a new economic direction.",
      "Could Trump issue a stimulus check?",
      "While some consumers might believe that Trump or Biden alone was responsible for sending out stimulus checks \u2014 perhaps because Trump put his name on the memo line of the first check \u2014 the payments were part of three bills passed by Congress, which were then sent to the sitting president for his signature.",
      "\"A president can't unilaterally issue stimulus checks, and the ones sent out during his last administration were largely the result of a push from Democrats in the House and Senate,\" Channel noted. \"Though Trump ultimately did sign the bill that sent stimulus checks to Americans, he isn't solely responsible for them.\"",
      "In other words, there would first need to be legislation passed by Congress to authorize another stimulus check, something that currently isn't on the horizon.",
      "Would a stimulus check impact inflation?",
      "With the Federal Reserve still aiming to pare inflation to a 2% annual rate \u2014 it stood at 2.6% last month \u2014 policymakers are likely to be cautious about any actions that could reignite inflation. Some economists have pointed to the surge in federal spending during the pandemic as\u00a0helping to create the conditions that led to the hottest inflation in 40 years.",
      "\"Because inflation is still such a big concern at the moment, the last thing a reasonable government would want to do is further stimulate consumer demand with stimulus checks because doing so would unnecessarily risk causing a resurgence in inflation,\" Channel noted.",
      "That being said, Trump's economic policies, including adding tariffs to imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could cause an inflation bump of as much of 1 percentage point, economists have said. That would push inflation to a range of about 3.6%, which Wall Street cautions could cause the Fed to hold off on further rate cuts.",
      "Could the IRS issue stimulus checks in 2024?",
      "The IRS sent the three rounds of pandemic stimulus checks after they were authorized by Congress and signed into law by Trump and Biden. In other words, without Congress' approval, the IRS won't be sending any stimulus checks in 2024.",
      "Currently there is no legislation in the works for stimulus spending, and such legislation is also considered extremely unlikely to occur in 2025. Instead, Trump and Republican lawmakers are likely to focus on tax legislation to extend the tax cuts in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, as well as tackling other spending issues, experts say.",

    "story": [
      "Thanksgiving dinner ingredients will cost more this year compared with last, even as food inflation cools. Fortunately, there's one simple way to save money without skimping on staple dishes for the food-driven holiday: store brands.",
      "Buying store-brand items versus national brand products is an age-old technique for saving money. And although there are instances of store-brand goods costing more than their name-brand counterparts, they can still save consumers money overall, new research from Wells Fargo\u00a0shows.",
      "How much can I save on store brands?",
      "\"Food inflation has slowed dramatically, but it's still not cheaper than a year ago, so that's a bone of contention from consumers,\" Wells Fargo chief agricultural economist Dr. Michael Swanson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, grocery stores can undercut national brand prices by selling their own version of products from tissues to baked beans. Stores allege their products are equally good, but because they don't market them, they can sell them at a relative discount.",
      "\"The whole premise is that store brand represents a value to you. What store brand is supposed to bring is the same quality, same product, without all the marketing,\" Swanson said. \"Brands explain why you should eat theirs and not someone else's, whereas stores don't spend money and are supposed to pass the savings along to us, the consumers.\"",
      "This year, a store-brand Thanksgiving menu for 10 people, including turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie will cost consumers $73. That same menu made with name-brand products, will cost $90 this year, or $17 more, according to the Wells Fargo report.",
      "The $73 price tag is up 2.7% from last year.",
      "Keep your eye on all items \u2014 not just the turkey",
      "Grocers tend to run promotions on turkeys around Thanksgiving, given that they're such a seasonal purchase \u2014 the two-week window before the Thanksgiving holiday is when grocers make the bulk of their whole turkey sales.",
      "But buyers beware: Some retailers can lure you into the store with a deal on a turkey, only to sell you other items at high prices.",
      "\"Retailers will feature discounts on turkey to get you into store so that, while you're there, you'll pick up everything else,\" Swanson said. \"Make sure you don't just go in for the turkey and not pay attention to prices of other things on the shopping list, which can add up to a lot of money.\"",
      "Store-brand stuffing mixes are still priced high, but are an opportunity for savings nevertheless. Name-brand stuffing is up 9% compared with the same period last year, and store-brand stuffing is up 3%.",

Personal bankruptcies were up\u00a016% in October from a year ago, as more Americans are seeking debt relief. But those struggling to stay financially afloat should consider the option sooner rather than later, advise experts who study when and why people file.",
      "\"When a consumer feels financial pressure, the last thing on their mind is seeking bankruptcy protection,\" said Michael Hunter, vice president, business development, at Epiq Aacer, a provider of bankruptcy information and partner to the American Bankruptcy Institute, or ABI. Most people don't file until 18 to 24 months after they've incurred financial hardship, Hunter said.",
      "Researchers, over decades of interviewing thousands of people who've declared personal bankruptcy, have found that about two-thirds of individual filers struggle with paying their debts for up to five years before seeking help.",
      "\"The common response is people are struggling with their debt for more than two years\" before seeking a legal remedy, Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"People misunderstand bankruptcy and wait too long to see a bankruptcy lawyer. Most people would benefit by going earlier,\" said Lawless, a co-principal investigator in the Consumer Bankruptcy\u00a0Project, launched in 1981 by a group of academics including Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a law school professor at the time.",
      "When to file for bankruptcy",
      "Because of the stigma and shame that Americans attach to bankruptcy, people turn to it as a last resort \u2014 oftentimes after they have plowed through retirement funds and other assets that would be have been shielded from creditors by filing for debt relief.",
      "\"If you are raiding pension or other retirement assets, that is a red flag,\" said Lawless, noting those funds are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Borrowing money to cover current expenses is another warning sign, he offered.",
      "\"It makes sense to file if a creditor is going to be able to take away something you need,\" said Pamela Foohey, a professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens. \"If a person is dealing with a wage garnishment that is harming their lives, or if a lender is threatening to repossess your car. If there's no other way to get a car that will fit your budget, filing could be a way to keep your car, or keep your house.\"",
      "Otherwise the broad answer is to first address how they might solve the cause of their financial distress before filing for bankruptcy. \"It doesn't help to find a better-paying job if after bankruptcy more is going out than coming in,\" said Lawless.",
      "\"If you lost your job, file after you found a new job; if you have a health crisis, you file after you've gotten better to discharge all of the medical debt that you've racked up,\" said Foohey.",
      "If someone undergoes a change in their family situation, whether it's a divorce or the birth of twins, she advises that they first figure out how they're going to manage going forward on a budget\u00a0after the debt is discharged.",
      "\"Bankruptcy does one thing, it gets rid of debt. It doesn't find you a job, it doesn't put money in your pocket,\" said Lawless.",
      "Also, legally speaking, once debt is discharged or a financial repayment plan is approved by a judge, it will be another 5 to 8 years before one can file again.",
      "Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13",
      "It costs about $1,500 to file Chapter 7, and most attorneys require that their fees be paid upfront. Chapter 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy, where one's nonexempt property and assets \u2014 possessions not protected by bankruptcy \u2014 are turned over to a trustee, and debt is discharged in 3 to 6 months. According to Lawless, 95% of Chapter 7 don't have any assets to turn over.",
      "With a Chapter 13, payments can be spread out, however the overall cost is a lot more.",
      "Having to hire and pay an attorney several thousands dollars is also a daunting prospect for those in financial turmoil, but Lawless said a lawyer is a better option than filing for bankruptcy yourself or looking to consumer credit counseling \u2014 a service that is typically for-profit and has a long history of problems.",
      "\"In Chapter 13, attorneys can allow for nothing upfront, put all their fees in the repayment plan, and on average charge $4,500,\" Foohey said.",
      "According to Foohey, only about a third of those who file Chapter 13 make it to the end and have their debts discharged. \"Not everyone wants the discharge, but to reset their relationship with their mortgage holder,\" she said.",
      "A Chapter 13 involves committing to a 3- to 5-year repayment plan. However, many filers that enter the agreements don't complete them, Lawless relayed. \"Homeowners will file 13 so they don't lose their home. It's among the tools used to get caught up on mortgage payments,\" he said.",
      "Attorneys charge far less for Chapter 7, as it's a less-complicated process than a Chapter 13. The latter is used for, but a bad idea, to pay for one's bankruptcy.",
      "\"In 7, you have to pay for your bankruptcy upfront. In Chapter 13 you pay your attorney in that 3- to 5-year plan,\" said Lawless. \"If you're using 13 to pay your attorney feels that is generally the wrong choice.\"",
      "In Lawless' view, \"the number one thing Congress should do is make it possible to pay your Chapter 7 attorney over time, so we don't have people filing Chapter 13 when they don't need to.\"",
      "Return to pre-COVID numbers",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but dropped off a cliff during the pandemic, thanks to government aid.",
      "\"It was very consistent from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 pretty flat, and then the pandemic hit. A lot of us thought volumes would surge,\" said Epiq's Hunter. But there was forbearance for student loans, cars and mortgages, he noted.",
      "\"Banks were extending olive branches, and we saw bankruptcies plummet to less than half of pre-pandemic levels,\" he said.",
      "\"There was a lot of money sloshing around,\" said Lawless, citing government stimulus programs and other aid. \"People paid down their debt,\" he stated.",
      "Now, with those financial lifelines largely unplugged, U.S. households are tacking more debt onto household balance sheets. \"The biggest surprise is bankruptcy filings haven't gone up even more,\" said Lawless, who expects a return to pre-COVID levels.",
      "Nonbusiness bankruptcy filings fell to under 400,000 before edging back up to 434,000 in 2023, according to statistics published by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. With two months left in 2024, personal bankruptcy filings stood at 405,132 at the end of October.",
      "\"We're still pretty far away from the filing numbers of 2019,\" said Foohey. \"There was a drastic drop at the time of the pandemic that continued for several years, which is now returning to pre-pandemic levels.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 18:09:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Brendan Carr wrote Project 2025's chapter on overhauling the Federal Communications Commission. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, will oversee the agency that regulates U.S. internet access and communications networks such as TV and radio. Carr believes it's an institution ripe for change,\u00a0 according to the chapter he wrote in Project 2025 about the FCC.",
      "Carr will be stepping into the role of FCC Chair after serving as one of its five commissioners since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the role during his first administration. Prior to that, Carr served as the agency's general counsel.",
      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will nominate former White House aide Brooke Rollins to be his agriculture secretary, the last of his picks to lead executive agencies and another choice from within his established circle of advisers and allies.",
      "The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025. Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Biden's agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition.",
      "Rollins, who graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as his former domestic policy chief. She is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration.",
      "Rollins, 52, previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation.",
      "Rollins' pick completes Trump's selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just two and a half weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the Small Business Administration.",
      "Trump didn't offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump's tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.",
      "President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The USDA oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation's food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the agency sets standards for school meals.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has vowed to strip ultraprocessed foods from school lunches and to stop allowing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries from using food stamps to buy soda, candy or other so-called junk foods. But it would be the USDA, not HHS, that would be responsible for enacting those changes.",

    "story": [
      "By phone from her office, just steps from Main Street, the mayor of Brevard, North Carolina, shared the pain of the local businesses down the street.",
      "For example, the hand-crafted gift shop called \"Local Color\" is accustomed to thousands of dollars in sales during an average weekend, Mayor Maureen Copelof said. But during one weekend after Hurricane Helene, \"All they sold was one bar of soap.\"",
      "The nearby seafood restaurant was so inundated with water from the hurricane floods, Copelof said the owner initially told her, \"I'm not even sure if I should try to rebuild.\"",
      "Brevard was among the dozens of North Carolina communities devastated by Hurricane Helene. But the crisis has morphed in October and November, into a painful and uncertain wait for federal aid that seems to have stalled.",
      "\"These businesses and these home owners are desperate and I am worried,\" Copelof told CBS News.\u00a0 \"October is our biggest month for tourism, and sales were down 50 to 75%.\"",
      "Helene ransacked western North Carolina on Sept. 27, leaving a path of devastation, death and an economic calamity from which the state will need years to recover.",
      "A standoff in Congress has indefinitely delayed efforts to replenish the U.S. Small Business Administration's disaster loan fund, which offers emergency loans to help homeowners and businesses rebuild damaged properties.\u00a0 The loans are also used to help upgrade homes and businesses to prevent against future storm damage.\u00a0 The money can also be used to help offset the loss of sales during business closures.",
      "Despite warnings from the Biden administration that the federal fund for the loans would be fully exhausted by October, Congress departed Washington before Election Day without passing legislation to replenish the fund. And upon its return from its recess last week, the Senate held a hearing to discuss plans for future funding of the loan program. But no legislation has been drafted, nor has a date been set to vote on any measure to restore the money.",
      "\"There's always a concern about Congress moving sluggishly,\" Sen. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican, told CBS News, \"But I'm talking to my colleagues in the Senate to make sure this emergency funding goes through and that it is spent appropriately.\"",
      "When asked how soon the funding will be needed for the communities impacted by Hurricane Helene, Budd responded, \"It was needed yesterday.\"",
      "\"These aren't just numbers on paper, it's real money.\u00a0 It's our livelihoods,\" said Mike Hawkins, who owns the Pisgah Fish Camp restaurant in Brevard, North Carolina.\u00a0 The building was damaged so severely that it can't be occupied.",
      "Hawkins has shuttered the business until at least January or February. The restaurant suffered nearly $300,000 in damaged equipment, including its refrigeration units and fryers, which is a uniquely painful loss for a restaurant that's partly famous for its onion rings.",
      "\"Small businesses have such little margin for error,\" Hawkins told CBS News.",
      "In the meantime, the backlog of applications for emergency loans has skyrocketed in recent weeks, according to a CBS News review.\u00a0 A federal official said 12,000 disaster loans have been prepared for approval and funding, totaling approximately $1 billion in help. The Small Business Administration is also processing an additional 60,000 applications nationwide, as the impasse over funding in Congress continues.",
      "A Congressional aide told CBS News approximately 40% of the pending applications are in North Carolina.",
      "The loan applications have been submitted by disaster victims, including homeowners and small businesses, in communities nationwide. Victims of hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other emergencies have sought aid, but Congressional aides told CBS News the historic and widespread devastation from Hurricane Helene has dramatically increased the number of victims who have sought the loans.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat who chaired a hearing last week on the crisis, said \"this is one of the longest times in my memory that we have gone without Congress providing disaster funding. That is unacceptable. It is well past time we get aid out to the many people in need, after the many disasters we have faced over the past two years.\"",
      "In testimony to the Senate panel, U.S. Small Business administrator Isabel Guzman said the agency \"provides support for those who don't have insurance or are underinsured.\"",
      "\"With delays, this further impacts them,\" she added.",
      "In North Carolina alone, the damage from Helene is sweeping and historic in scope. A report from Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said at least 151,000 homes and 500,000 small businesses suffered damage.",
      "\"We are now 54 days past Helene's initial impact,\" Tillis said. \"Many in the mainstream media and outside world may have moved on and returned to business as usual, but for my constituents in Western North Carolina: Life is now measured in the time before and after Hurricane Helene.\"",
      "Due to Washington's inaction, some of the communities who are awaiting the emergency loans are launching local fundraisers to offer temporary help to impacted businesses.\tIn Brevard, the popular local band Steep Canyon Rangers staged a fundraising concert along the city's main street on a late October evening.\tIn folding chairs, crowds blanketed the street.",
      "Tickets were free, and attendees were asked to donate to a charity formed to help fund the storm-impacted community members.",

      "Washington \u2014 Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, said Sunday that the upcoming months will be \"really critical\" in determining the \"next phase\" of the war in Ukraine as the president-elect is expected to work to force a negotiated settlement when he enters office.",
      "McMaster, a CBS News contributor, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Russia and Ukraine are both incentivized to make \"as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in\" as the two countries seek leverage in negotiations.",
      "With an eye toward strengthening Ukraine's standing before President-elect Donald Trump returns to office in the new year, the Biden administration agreed in recent days to provide anti-personnel land mines for use, while lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made longer range missiles to strike within Russian territory. The moves come as Ukraine marked more than 1,000 days since Russia's invasion in February 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, many of Trump's key selection for top posts in his administration \u2014 Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Sens. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and JD Vance for Vice President \u2014 haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine, or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "McMaster said the dynamic is \"a real problem\" and delivers a \"psychological blow to the Ukrainians.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts, and it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail,\" he said. \"And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.\"",
      "McMaster said he's hopeful that Trump's picks, and the president-elect himself, will \"begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.\" He cited the North Korean soldiers fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II, the efforts China is taking to \"sustain Russia's war-making machine,\" and the drones and missiles Iran has provided as part of the broader picture.",
      "\"So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world,\" McMaster said.",
      "On Trump's selections for top national security and defense posts, McMaster stressed the importance of the Senate's advice and consent role in making sure \"the best people are in those positions.\"",
      "McMaster outlined that based on his experience, Trump listens to advice and learns from those around him. And he argued that the nominees for director of national intelligence and defense secretary should be asked key questions like how they will \"reconcile peace through strength,\" and what they think \"motivates, drives and constrains\" Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump has tapped former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, who has been criticized for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries. McMaster said Sunday that Gabbard has a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" about what motivates Putin.",
      "More broadly, McMaster said he \"can't understand\" the Republicans who \"tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points,\" saying \"they've got to disabuse themselves of this strange affection for Vladimir Putin.\"",
      "Meanwhile, when asked about Trump's recent selection of Sebastian Gorka as senior director for counterterrorism and deputy assistant to the president, McMaster said he doesn't think Gorka is a good person to advise the president-elect on national security. But he noted that \"the president, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly.\"",

      "NIKOLE KILLION (voice-over): After Saturday lunch with one of the senators who will vote on his Cabinet picks, president-elect Donald Trump announced former domestic policy adviser Brooke Rollins for agriculture secretary.",
      "One of his most highly anticipated selections was Scott Bessent for Treasury. If confirmed, the 62-year-old investor would be the first openly gay secretary to lead it and responsible for quarterbacking Mr. Trump's proposed policies on taxes and tariffs.",
      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: A new CBS News poll shows a majority of Americans support imposing tariffs on imported goods, and more have an optimistic view of the economy since the election.",
      "Mr. Trump selected a pair of doctors to lead health agencies. Former Congressman David Weldon has promoted debunked anti-vaccine views and is being tapped to lead the Centers for Disease Control. Food and Drug Administration pick Martin Makary critiqued vaccine mandates during the COVID pandemic.",
      "And Project 2025 architect Russ Vought plans to reprise his role as White House budget director, despite Trump's disavowal of the conservative policy blueprint.",
      "PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Project 2025.",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Our polling also finds many of the president-elect's well- known designees have more support than opposition, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth.",
      "The former FOX News host picked to lead the Pentagon is drawing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault in a 2017 police report.",
      "Did you sexually assault a woman in Monterey, California?",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I have \u2013 as far as the media is concerned, I will keep this very simple. The matter was fully investigated. And I was completely cleared. And that's where I'm going to leave it.",
      "(End VT)",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: While president-elect Trump has filled out most of his Cabinet, a few economic positions remain up for grabs, including U.S. trade representative and small business administrator \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Nikole Killion in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training.",
      "I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline.",
      "Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK Jr. at HHS secretary, Dave Weldon to CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65, and yet the Biden administration and Rochelle Walensky actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your 6-month-old, and the American public is rejecting this.",
      "Only about 20 percent of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster, because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's vaccination rates in other \u2013 other vaccines as well, not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles. There are concerns about other\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Right, but people have to believe it. Exactly.",
      "But people are doubting because they're being told that. I will give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines.",
      "But, like, when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just \u2013 my baby is new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months?",
      "So, really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country.",
      "I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees, from what I heard. You \u2013 you have been \u2013 I'm sorry. Did you want to say\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though.",
      "But you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57 percent of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters.",
      "The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40 percent say the U.S. military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard, and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I'm 100 percent supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people.",
      "Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say all-points bulletin, all in, but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",
      "And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, if he's going to resist that, it will go all the way to the Supreme Court.",
      "And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of the state of Illinois. She sits on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",
      "So it's about, are they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War with Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House.",
      "Good morning, and welcome back.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER (Retired, Former White House National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you.",
      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The 2024 election was historic for several reasons. Among them, the first openly transgender person was elected to the United States Congress. She joins us now from the state she will be representing, Delaware. Democratic Representative-elect Sarah McBride.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Thank you for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting given how polarized, how angry and divided this country is that people choose to serve and to run. You told my colleague, Scott MacFarlane, that it was your personal experience as a caregiver for your husband during his bout with terminal cancer that inspired you to run. Do you expect that health care policy will be the focus of your work here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I certainly am glad to be back here in Delaware after two weeks of orientation and to have the privilege of serving the state that I love in Congress.",
      "I ran to bring down costs facing workers, retirees, and their families. That means bringing down the cost of health care, but also housing and childcare and everyday expenses like gas and groceries.",
      "I did run for office after my experience as a caregiver to my husband, Andy, during his battle with cancer. And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",
      "And I ran for office because I do not believe that in the wealthiest, most developed nation on earth, that that time and that ability to get care should be a matter of luck. I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Paid leave is something that Mr. Trump has - has paid lip service to. We'll see in the new Congress if it comes up.",
      "We see in our CBS polling that 86 percent of voters feel congressional Democrats should find common ground with Mr. Trump and Republicans.",
      "Do you feel you can?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I said throughout this campaign that I will work with anyone who's willing to work with me to help Delawareans, to lower cost facing my constituents. There are opportunities for us to find common ground. But it's also clear that this administration, as it begins to fill its appointments with Project 2025 authors, that a lot of the policies that this president will pursue will likely hurt my constituents and raise prices.",
      "And so, where I need to fight back, I will. But where I can find common ground, I will certainly seek it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: That's when I've done during my time in the general assembly where nearly every bill I passed, passed with bipartisan support.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): A man is a man, and a woman is a woman. And a man cannot become a woman. That said, I also believe - that's what scripture teaches, what I just said. But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe are you are being treated with dignity by your colleagues?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: I didn't run for the United States House of Representatives to talk about what bathroom I use. I didn't run to talk about myself. I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.",
      "And I look forward to working with any colleague who's ready to work and ready to be serious about the issues that matter because, at the end of the day, how I'm being treated does not matter. What matters is how the American people are being treated, and whether we're actually focused on the issues that matter to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of your fellow congressional Democrats, including Tom Suozzi and Seth Moulton, have also recently spoken about their feelings, looking back at the last election, and said Democrats should be more open about saying whether they object to transgender athletes playing in girls' sports. Those were the specific examples they brought up.",
      "How would you respond to your soon-to-be Democratic colleagues on those? Do you understand why some parents, for example, feel uncomfortable or frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Look, I think this country is still entering into a conversation about who trans people are, the full diversity of the community. And I've had conversations with colleagues in the Democratic caucus already that span diversity of thought about how the party should engage on a whole host of issues.",
      "But I think we are all united that every single American deserves equal rights, I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean spirited but really an attempt to misdirect. Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. It is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time - every single time we hear them say the word trans, look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors while privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Look what they're doing undermining workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: And here's also what we have to be clear about, because I think the last week has been a prime example of this. Every bit of time and energy that is used to divert the attention of the federal government to go after trans people is time and energy that is not focused on addressing the cost of living for our constituents. And we have clear that there is a real cost for the American worker every time they focus on this.",

President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn, he does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So who will those people be? I think, for the new Secretary of Defense, the nominated Director of National Intelligence, they- they ought to be asked, or- what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on- on the nominee for- for the- for- for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made, and I think, as a result, almost green lighted the invasion, the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022. What are the consequences if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds, globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile, or help President Trump reconcile, peace through strength? And what you see in some elements of the Republican Party, which replicate the far left, oftentimes, toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries, as- as- as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about how- how Putin really felt aggrieved, and that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's- that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated, and in direct contravention to what U.S. intelligence has concluded. I also want to ask about someone you--",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: This is what- this is what I can't understand, Margaret. There's so- there's some people in the Republican Party these days which kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points. I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a kind of a defender of Western civilization, just the shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who- who is- who is not going to stop in his effort to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of reestablishing the Russian Empire. And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do. And the only thing that stops it, really, is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin. Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the Senior Director for Counterterrorism, Deputy Assistant to the President. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LT. GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But, you know, I think that- that the President, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly, soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Time stamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 24, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of democratic control, the Senate and the White House has a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by the end of December, pass the defense bil l-the NDAA- and extension to the farm bill. And I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding- emergency Relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The President has now submitted a $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief, and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone. Is that right?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This- that's part of the Emergency Relief Fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike will support disaster relief. We've always had the philosophy\" all for one and one for all\" when Americans get hit by these disasters, I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon, and as you know, a new commander-in-chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies. But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as Secretary of State, for example. Or this new choice to be labor secretary?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is this is what the vetting process is all about. The hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations, and I take that responsibility very seriously. I have been troubled by some talk that President-elect Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new Republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do it and run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out. Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done, and I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7 of last year and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the President had effectively used US leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely, and then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months, the President will finally make more effective use of American leverage to at the very least uphold American law, to insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza and they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you take a nuanced and specific stand on that upholding, US law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department is reviewing 500 incidents where US weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel is doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be greenlit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the President of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by secretaries Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500 as you said. And we haven't gotten the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process, because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen US weapons used in violation of international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM-20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that US weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed US officials on this privately, they've said, \"What do you want us to do? You want us to put in a halt for a few weeks and then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point?\" How do you respond to that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The President had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level- at the senior level, who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a cease fire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet, President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Why?--",
      "SEN. VAN HALLEN: \u2013for his obstruction on this, even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the President of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean, he's been ignored on other things too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the Palestinian Authority--",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts, and yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books. So this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course, we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position. Thank you. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, of the state of Illinois. She sits on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning, thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become Attorney General. This was after he had met with senators, and CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green light. I'm glad that they held the line on him. I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected. But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of defense, since you sit in this advisory role on armed services, I don't have to tell you, but for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now. Thousands of them in front line combat roles. You were one of them in 2004 when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG and you sustained severe injuries. Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving.",
      "[ PETE HEGSETH SOT ]",
      "PETE HEGSETH: I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "[ END SOT ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on armed services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong. Our military could not go to war without the 220,000 plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal. And let me just make one thing clear, the women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in special forces or the COs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong. We don't. The ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing. And so he's just flat out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is. He was a pretty low ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately, unqualified for the position. Remember that the Pentagon is 3 million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And frankly, women actually make our military more effective. And I've personally found that I brought many insights to my job. When I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer, that came from my own personal background, that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all male unit, and my gender didn't have- wasn't a problem. I just adapted, and we continue to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex. I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as, \"rape: victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events. Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullen said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\" Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, that's- that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year. I hope that we will, but I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and- and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma. It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "This past week, your committee did review a number of military promotions, nearly 1000 of them, and one name that seems to have been left off the list, despite the Pentagon's recommendation, was Lieutenant General Christopher Donahue. He was- he became known as the last U.S. service person to leave Afghanistan back in 2021, a key role there. Sources tell CBS that it is your Republican senator colleague, Senator Mullen, who stood in the way of this. I'm told it's out of a desire to hold those accountable for Afghanistan. What do you make of this? And is there a chance it could move?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH",
      "Well, if he is fully qualified for the move and for the promotion, he should come before the committee, the whole committee, not one member of the committee, and we should consider him. Remember that I wrote the legislation that created the Afghan War Commission. So we are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan. And that was a bipartisan commission. We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened to- in Afghanistan. It's, you know, you're not going to get a full picture by holding one person's promotion up. Frankly, he needs to come before the full committee, and we need to decide, and it's not Markwayne Mullen's decision whether or not one promotion comes before the committee.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, I ask because there are concerns about whether there will be generals held to account by Mr. Trump, as he said, he thinks others should be fired for Afghanistan. But to move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel. Your colleague, Senator Van Hollen, said, it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position, and in fact, I have co-signed many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world. My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions, they don't actually have binding effect. And frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now, and I am deeply concerned that resolution, that doesn't actually do anything, might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience, but I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza, and you know, I've co-signed many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration. With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary, former Congresswoman Lori Chavez DeRemer. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as- as pro- union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Absolutely, I- you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins, over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back. I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump. So it's about were they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: Thank you",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is set to chair the Homeland Security Committee next year, and he sits on the Health Committee. Welcome back to \"Face The Nation,\" Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are a doctor by training. I want to ask you about some of these health picks. I know that you personally said that you have vaccinated all of your children, but vaccination rates in this country, as you know, are on the decline. Are you at all concerned that elevating individuals who have been publicly critical of some particular vaccines, RFK jr. at HHS Secretary, Dave Weldon, the CDC director, that any of that will erode trust in vaccination?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I think all of us can agree that there's an increase of vaccine hesitancy. I think it comes from people not believing what the government is telling them. The fact that the CDC committee for vaccines and the FDA committee for vaccines said for COVID boosters that you should take a booster if you're over 65 and yet the Biden administration, Rochelle Walensky, actually politicized that, didn't follow the signs and said you should boost your six-month-old. And the American public is rejecting this. Only about 20% of the American public of all ages is taking the COVID booster because the government hasn't been honest with us. That dishonesty has led to vaccine hesitancy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Well its vaccination rates in other- other vaccines as well not just COVID vaccines. There's concern about measles\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013Right but people have to believe it, right exactly, but people are doubting because they're being told that. I'll give you an example. Look, I think vaccines, smallpox, the story of smallpox vaccine, polio vaccine, are some of the most miraculous discoveries in all of medicine. And I'm not against vaccines, but like when my kids were little, the hepatitis B vaccine, they still want to give it to them as a newborn. I just- my babies new and just, you know, come into the world, and you can see how a lot of reasonable people say, Why do I have to do it as a newborn? Could I come back in three months or six months? So really, it's about choice. It's about getting rid of mandates. It's about letting people participate, but it's also about the government being honest. What are the risks and what are the benefits? And they haven't been honest on COVID, because healthy children do not die from COVID, do not get seriously sick, and there's no proof that the vaccine has any medical benefit for healthy children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well we want to move on to other topics, sir, but we will continue to cover vaccination in this country. I think what you said there is that you're supportive of all those health nominees. From what I heard you, you have been- I'm sorry, did you want to say?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I was just going to say, yes, I am supportive,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SEN. PAUL: But I wouldn't describe them as the problem with vaccine hesitancy. I would describe the government misinformation as the problem with vaccine hesitancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Messengers matter, though, but you have raised concerns in your role on Homeland Security about the implementation of some of the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. His mass deportation vow is very popular. Our CBS polling shows 57% of voters like the idea, but how it is implemented matters a lot to voters. The vast majority prefer that federal law enforcement or immigration agencies carry them out. Just 40% say the US military should be involved. The stated Trump plan is to use the military, military assets, deputize the National Guard and have them act as immigration agents. Do you believe that is lawful?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, I'm 100% supportive of going after the 15,000 murderers, the 13,000 sexual assault perpetrators, rapists, all these people. Let's send them on their way to prison or back home to another prison. So I would say All-points bulletin, all in but you don't do it with the Army because it's illegal. We've, we've had a distrust of putting the army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to Judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific. And so I'm for removing these people, but I would do it through the normal process of domestic policing. Now, I would say that the mayor of Denver, if he's going to resist federal law, which there's a longstanding history of the supremacy of federal law, he's going to resist that it will go all the way to the Supreme Court. And I would suspect that he would be removed from office. I don't know whether or not there'd be a criminal prosecution for someone resisting federal law, but he will lose. And people need to realize that what he is- what he is offering, is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government. Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and really, I think will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40 year period of time. The. What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up. There are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially. How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS Secretary Kristi Noem?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image. But I will tell you, but just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen, and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol. And they have a list now of 15,000 I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list. You put these people on an All-points bulletin. These are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on. And they would go out and seek those people that we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes, that should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them, in all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from. So I think if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching carrying semi automatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right",
      "SEN. PAUL: Object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard. That specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors. I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or army. I think there's a lot of FBI, there's a lot of border patrol agents. There's a better way to do it, and it needs to be individualized. That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor. Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SEN.\u00a0 PAUL: You know, I've heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive. I don't like tariffs, but then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel, there are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel. So yeah, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people. I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against best and because it's also the President's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade. It's part of one of the booms of post-war and post-industrial revolution. These amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail. As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget. Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, in 2017 I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go, it's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue that you have to have spending cuts. So, I've always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I've also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut- cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector. I think that's a good idea, but if you do it. I would cut spending, and there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force, that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86% prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64% polled by us, think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington. Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Yes, and I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit. And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013yes",
      "SEN. PAUL: and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: \u2013And so I think that the people are, and would be, overwhelmingly in favor",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK\u2013",
      "SEN. PAUL: -Of someone who's going to base hiring on merit not on racial characteristics.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said that Pete Hegseth is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said Sunday that Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary is \"flat-out wrong\" in his view that women should not serve in the military in combat roles.",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform,\" Duckworth said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.\"",
      "Trump tapped Hegseth, a former Fox News host and Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as his pick to head the Defense Department earlier this month. The 44-year-old has drawn criticism for his stance on women in combat roles, along with his level of experience.",
      "Duckworth, who in 2004 deployed to Iraq as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot and sustained severe injuries when her helicopter was hit by an RPG, outlined that women who serve in combat roles have met the same standards as men, passing rigorous testing. She said Hegseth's position \"just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is,\" while arguing that he's \"inordinately unqualified for the position.\"",
      "\"Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform,\" Duckworth said. She added that having women in the military \"does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.\"",
      "Hegseth has also drawn scrutiny amid recently unearthed details about an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017. Hegseth denies the allegation and characterized the incident as a consensual encounter. The Monterey County district attorney's office declined to file charges as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" His lawyer has acknowledged that Hegseth paid a confidential financial settlement to the woman out of concern that the allegation would jeopardize his employment.",
      "Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, said it's \"really troubling\" that Trump would nominate someone who \"has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him.\"",
      "\"This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense,\" she added.",
      "The comments come after Trump announced a slew of picks for top posts in his administration in recent days. Meanwhile, one pick \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general \u2014 has already withdrawn his name from consideration after he faced intense scrutiny amid a House Ethics Committee investigation and a tenuous path to Senate confirmation.",
      "While Duckworth acknowledged that she's glad her Senate Republicans \"held the line\" on Gaetz and also elected Sen. John Thune as leader over a candidate favored by many in Trump's orbit, she said she's \"deeply concerned\" her Republican colleagues will green light Trump's nominees.",
      "\"From what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump,\" Duckworth said.",
      "But Duckworth didn't rule out supporting some of the nominees herself during the Senate confirmation process, pledged to evaluate each candidate based on their ability to do the job, and their willingness to put the needs of the American people before \"a retribution campaign for Mr. Trump.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a CBS News poll released on Sunday found that 33% of Americans say Hegseth is a \"good choice\" for defense secretary, including 64% of Trump voters. But 39% of Americans said they hadn't heard enough yet about the pick. More broadly, Americans generally say they want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said he believes that Hegseth can run the massive Defense Department, despite his lack of experience managing a large organization. Though he did not address Hegseth's comments about women in combat roles, Paul said he believes the \"vast majority of people\" support leaders who are picked based on merit, citing Hegseth's criticism of the Pentagon for what he says has been a move away from merit-based hiring and toward hiring based on \"racial characteristics.\"",

      "The promotion of a three-star general who was part of the 2021\u00a0U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan\u00a0has been paused by Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, three sources familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News Saturday.",
      "Lt. Gen. Christopher Donahue was slated to be promoted to a four-star rank and take command of the U.S. Army in Europe. However, he was not included in a batch of nearly 1,000 promotions that moved through the Senate Armed Services Committee this week despite receiving a Pentagon recommendation.",
      "Mullin has put a hold on the promotion. The intention is to allow for the new Republican-controlled Congress and President-elect Donald Trump to weigh in on the promotion given Donahue's involvement in the Afghanistan withdrawal, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "Behind the scenes, there is an effort underway by the Army and other allies to convince Congress to move forward and lift the hold, which appears to be politically motivated, sources said.",
      "During\u00a0the campaign, Trump frequently mentioned his surprise that no officers were consequently fired by President Biden for the chaotic withdrawal.",
      "Military officers execute U.S. policy but do not create it. It was the Trump administration that in February 2020\u00a0brokered the deal\u00a0with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but it was Mr. Biden\u00a0who decided\u00a0to execute that withdrawal despite the Taliban breaking the terms of that U.S. agreement.",
      "Donahue was the last U.S. soldier to exit Afghanistan in 2021. The U.S. evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its withdrawal, during which dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were killed\u00a0in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul.",

      "CBS News has reached out to Mullin's office but did not receive a response. It is not clear whether Trump is aware of the hold.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that if Donahue is \"fully qualified\" for the promotion, he should come before the full Armed Services Committee, rather than allow one senator to hold it up.",
      "\"We are actually undergoing, right now, an active, multi-year review of what happened in Afghanistan, and that was a bipartisan commission,\" Duckworth said. \"We passed that law in a bipartisan way, and I hope the committee will be allowed to move forward with reviewing what happened in Afghanistan.

      "Trump's handling of his presidential transition gets approval from most Americans overall and brings near-universal approval from his voters, along with a net-positive response about his selections for Cabinet posts, in particular, Sen. Marco Rubio, who is Trump's pick to be secretary of state.",
      "After inflation and the economy so dominated the election, Americans are more inclined to think his administration will bring down prices for food and groceries rather than raise them, and his voters overwhelmingly say that. Going into the election, his backers expected that, too.",
      "In a similar vein, Trump's election already has some Republicans' views of the economy improving.",
      "Overall, Republicans today are more excited about what Trump will do as president now than they were in 2016 when he was first elected.",
      "Democrats say they feel more scared about what Trump might do than they did in 2016, and a large majority of Democrats think as president he will threaten their rights and freedoms. But at the same time, there seems to be a sense of exhaustion, as fewer than half of Democrats feel motivated to oppose Trump right now.",
      "Americans, and Democrats specifically, do think the Biden administration should work with the incoming Trump administration to ensure a smooth transition, and that congressional Democrats should work with Donald Trump on issues where they find common ground.",
      "Trump and the economy",
      "After winning comes expectations. There's a net optimism about the incoming administration's effect on food and grocery prices, especially among Trump's voters. That comes as most Americans continue to say prices are currently rising. And inflation was a big factor in Trump winning in the first place.",
      "It may be no surprise then that among many potential items for the incoming administration, Americans say plans to lower prices ought to be the top priority.",
      "The percentage of Republicans who call the U.S. economy good, while still low, has gone up, as the percentage who call it very bad has dropped. That pushes voters' overall evaluation of the economy slightly higher than it's been this year \u2014 and further spotlights how much partisanship, along with optimism, always plays into these evaluations.",

      "Trump's current selections for agency heads and Cabinet picks get rated overwhelmingly as good choices from Trump's voters, and are net-positive as selections among Americans who have heard enough about them to say. (Many have not heard enough yet.)",
      "As a general rule, Americans want Trump to appoint people who'll speak their minds and who have experience in the field or agency they'll run. But in addition to those qualities, Republicans also want people who'll be loyal to Trump.",

      "On another economic front, Trump's voters overwhelmingly favor the idea of tariffs: most of them don't believe that will make prices higher. (For the third who believe tariffs will raise prices but support them anyhow, this is presumably a cost they're willing to bear.)",

      "\"I think it's worked wonderfully,\" Harris recalled in 2004, when he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Boston. \"It's made the selection much more legitimate and democratic.\"",
      "\"The Democratic Party was not democratic, and many of the delegations were pretty much boss-controlled or -dominated. And in the South, there was terrible discrimination against African Americans,\" he said.",
      "Harris ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, quitting after poor showings in early contests, including a fourth-place win in New Hampshire. The more moderate Jimmy Carter went on to win the presidency.",
      "Harris moved to New Mexico that year and became a political science professor at the University of New Mexico. He wrote and edited more than a dozen books, mostly on politics and Congress. In 1999 he broadened his writings with a mystery set in Depression-era Oklahoma.",
      "Throughout his political career, Harris was a leading liberal voice for civil rights and anti-poverty programs to help minorities and the disadvantaged. Along with his first wife, LaDonna, a Comanche, he also was active in Native American issues.",
      "\"I've always called myself a populist or progressive,\" Harris said in a 1998 interview. \"I'm against concentrated power. I don't like the power of money in politics. I think we ought to have programs for the middle class and working class.\"",
      "\"Today 'populism' is often a dirty word because of how certain leaders wield power,\" Heinrich said in his statement Saturday. \"But Fred represented a different brand of populism \u2014 one that was never mean or exclusionary. Instead, Fred focused his work and attention on regular people who are often overlooked by the political class.\"",
      "Harris was a member of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, the so-called Kerner Commission, appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the urban riots of the late 1960s.",
      "The commission's groundbreaking report in 1968 declared, \"our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\"",

      "\"That resonates with people...the notion of the average person against the elite,\" Ornstein said. \"Fred Harris had a real ability to articulate those concerns, particularly of the downtrodden.\"",
      "In 1968, Harris served as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey. He and others pressed Humphrey to use the convention to break with Johnson on the Vietnam War. But Humphrey waited to do so until late in the campaign, and narrowly lost to Republican Richard Nixon.",
      "\"That was the worst year of my life, '68. We had Dr. Martin Luther King killed. We had my Senate seatmate Robert Kennedy killed and then we had this terrible convention,\" Harris said in 1996.",

      "After assuming the Democratic Party leadership post, Harris appointed commissions that recommended reforms in the procedures for selecting delegates and presidential nominees. While lauding the greater openness and diversity, he said there had been a side effect: \"It's much to the good. But the one result of it is that conventions today are ratifying conventions. So it's hard to make them interesting.\"",
      "\"My own thought is they ought to be shortened to a couple of days. But they are still worth having, I think, as a way to adopt a platform, as a kind of pep rally, as a way to get people together in a kind of coalition-building,\" he said.",

      "He worked part-time as a janitor and printer's assistant to help for his education at University of Oklahoma. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1952, majoring in political science and history. He received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1954, and then moved to Lawton to practice.",
      "In 1956, he won election to the Oklahoma state Senate and served for eight years. In 1964, he launched his career in national politics in the race to replace Sen. Robert S. Kerr, who died in January 1963.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated a critic of COVID-19 health measures to lead the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump nominated Dr. Marty Makary Friday to lead the Food and Drug Administration, selecting a surgeon and author who opposed vaccine mandates and some other public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Makary, a Johns Hopkins University professor, is the latest in a string of Trump nominees who have declared the U.S. health system to be \"broken\" and in need of a shakeup.",
      "Makary has criticized in books and articles the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.",
      "\"I'm a part of a generation that says, 'We as a medical generation have made some mistakes, we've done things that resulted in a loss of the public trust and we need to be open and honest about our problems if we're going to fix it,'\" Markey\u00a0said\u00a0in a 2012 interview with \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Trump announced the nomination in a statement Friday night, saying Makary would \"restore FDA to the gold standard of scientific research, and cut the bureaucratic red tape at the agency to make sure Americans get the medical cures and treatments they deserve.\" Makary will have to be confirmed by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Headquartered in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the 18,000 employees of the FDA are responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and medical devices as well as a swath of other consumer goods, including food, cosmetics and vaping products. Altogether those products represent an estimated 20% of U.S. consumer spending annually, or $2.6 trillion.",
      "Makary gained prominence on Fox News and other conservative outlets for his contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic. He questioned the need for masking and, though he was not opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, Makary had concerns about vaccinations in young children.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that COVID-19 vaccinations prevented more than 686,000 U.S. deaths in 2020 and 2021 alone. While children faced much lower rates of hospitalization and death from the virus, medical societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that vaccinations significantly reduced severe disease in the age group.",
      "Trained as a surgeon and cancer specialist, Makary was part of a vocal group of physicians calling for greater emphasis on herd immunity to stop the virus, or the idea that mass infections would quickly lead to population-level protection.",
      "In a February 2021 Wall Street Journal piece, he wrote that \"COVID will be mostly gone by April, allowing Americans to resume normal life.\" That summer the delta variant of the virus ripped through the U.S., followed by omicron in the winter, leading to hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.",
      "If Makary is confirmed and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also confirmed as Trump's pick to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, Makary would likely report to Kennedy. Makary does not share Kennedy's discredited views on vaccines, but he has a similar distrust of the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Makary has lamented that drugmakers used misleading data to urge doctors to prescribe OxyContin and other opioids as low-risk, non-addictive pain relievers. That marketing was permitted under FDA-approved labeling from the 1990s, suggesting the drugs were safe for common ailments like back pain.",
      "In more recent years, the FDA has come under fire for approving drugs for Alzheimer's, ALS and other conditions based on incomplete data that failed to show meaningful benefits for patients.",
      "A push toward greater scrutiny of drug safety and effectiveness would be a major reversal at FDA, which for decades has focused on speedier drug approvals. That trend has been fueled by industry lobbying and fees paid by drugmakers to help the FDA hire additional reviewers.",
      "Kennedy has proposed ending those payments, which would require billions in new funding from the federal budget.",
      "Other administration priorities would likely run into similar roadblocks. For instance, Kennedy wants to bar drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar market that supports many TV and cable networks. The Supreme Court and other conservative judges would likely overturn such a ban on First Amendment grounds that protect commercial speech, experts note.",
      "Makary would also inherit a number of ongoing projects at the FDA kicked off by outgoing Commissioner Robert Califf, including the reorganization of the agency's food division and plans to regulate artificial intelligence in medical technology.",
      "In the event of other controversial initiatives under Trump, career staffers may simply drag the work out until a new administration comes to power.",
      "\"The bureaucracy can wait anybody out, and that's an attitude I think you'll hear a lot,\" said Wayne Pines, a former FDA official under Republican and Democratic administrations.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 19:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds.",
      "Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.",
      "\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Scott Bessent.",
      "What is Bessent's educational and work history?",
      "Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine.",
      "\"And he even offered \u2014 which was key for me \u2014 a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication.",
      "Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund\u00a0 Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.",
      "What are Bessent's political and economic views?",
      "In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.",
      "\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"",
      "Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"",
      "Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "What about Bessent's ties with Soros?",
      "The relationship between a one-time Soros prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.",
      "But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth.",
      "While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.",
      "What about Bessent's personal life?",
      "Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children.",
      "\"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.",
      "Politics also runs in his family, as former Rep. John Jenrette was his uncle and is also known for serving a prison sentence for his role in 1980s Abscam scandal, South Carolina's Post and Courier reported.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:04:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump's new lawyers will have to decide how to handle hot-button issues before the high court this term, including cases on treatments for transgender youth and on ghost guns.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court convenes for arguments in December, the justices will hear from the top lawyer for the Biden administration, who will urge them to strike down laws in nearly half the states that ban hormone treatments for transgender minors.",
      "In January, President-elect Donald Trump's new lawyers at the Justice Department will have to decide if the federal government still believes those laws are unconstitutional.",
      "How to handle ongoing cases before the Supreme Court is always one of the most consequential questions for a new presidential administration. It's a big task. Of the 45 cases that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear for its current term, which began in October, the United States is party to 21 of them, including the case over certain treatments for transgender youth. In many others, the Biden administration has outlined its view of the legal issues.",
      "In most of those cases, the Justice Department takes a predictable, even nonpartisan approach, such as by routinely defending federal criminal prosecutions on appeal.",
      "But other cases involve judgment calls that reflect the new administration's policy preferences.",
      "In addition to the transgender case, many others touch on hot-button issues: the Biden administration supported a federal regulation of ghost guns, which are weapons that people can buy in pieces and put together at home; it opposed a lower court's ban on a Texas law that requires people who access pornographic websites to prove they are adults; and it defended the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize flavored e-cigarette products for sale.",
      "But Trump's lawyers can flip these positions. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in 2022, \"a new administration is of course as a general matter entitled to do that.\"",
      "How does it work? That depends.",
      "If the United States lost the case in the lower court, the new lawyers can simply dismiss the appeal.",
      "The Biden administration took this approach in a prominent 2020 abortion case over Trump's decision to bar federally funded health clinics from making abortion referrals. When a lower court struck down the policy, Trump's lawyers brought it to the Supreme Court, which agreed to consider the issue.. But after President Biden took office in early 2021, his legal team dropped the appeal and the case was removed from the Supreme Court's calendar.",
      "The Trump administration will now have to decide whether to withdraw its appeal in the transgender case. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, a Biden appointee who argues on behalf of the government before the Supreme Court, has argued that state laws that keep minors from taking hormones \"discriminate[] based on transgender status.\" Trump, who campaigned on getting \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools,\" is unlikely to see the issue the same way.",
      "But Trump's lawyers may consider staying the course if it looks like the Supreme Court disagrees with the Biden administration's position at oral argument early next month. This prospect seems likely because the ACLU is poised to pursue the case if the government drops out, making withdrawal by the new Trump administration potentially futile.",
      "The Trump administration's approach to the ghost-guns case is also unclear. At oral argument in October, the justices indicated that they had no issue with the Biden administration's regulations on these do-it-yourself weapons, buoying the spirits of gun-control advocates. If the Trump administration opposes the regulations on ghost guns, which subject these weapons to the same requirements as firearms sold commercially, it could dismiss the case, which would keep intact a lower court ruling that blocked the rule.",
      "In contrast, if another party is appealing a case that the U.S. won in the lower court, the approach of Trump's lawyers may depend on different factors.",
      "One factor is how far the case has progressed. In January 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a criminal-sentencing case. But before the parties submitted briefs outlining their arguments in the case, the Biden administration told the Supreme Court that \"following the change in administration, the Department of Justice began a process of reviewing the government's interpretation of\" the law and reversed course. The Supreme Court then appointed an outside lawyer to argue the Trump administration's previous position.",
      "And regardless, the Supreme Court's caseload may change if Trump rolls back Mr. Biden's policies. In 2017, Trump, in his first term, dropped former President Barack Obama's policy for bathroom use for transgender students right before a Republican challenge to the guidance landed at the Supreme Court, which brought an end to the case.",
      "Trump's new lawyers will have to make strategic choices against this backdrop.",
      "Some may involve how to portray the government's interests. The Supreme Court sometimes asks Justice Department lawyers to explain how a pending ruling might affect the government. Several of these kinds of requests are outstanding, including a Honolulu challenge that seeks to hold oil and gas companies accountable for the effects of emissions on the climate.",
      "And some choices might not even result in any change to the Supreme Court's current docket. One of the administration's jobs is to ask the high court to review upcoming cases. Trump's new lawyers may withdraw \u2014 or simply never pursue \u2014 certain appeals that the Biden administration teed up.",

      "The adult male was found on Nov. 1 on Ocean Beach sand dunes in the town of Denmark in temperate southwest Australia \u2014 about 2,200 miles north of the icy waters off the Antarctic coast, the Western Australia state government said. He was released from a Parks and Wildlife Service boat on Wednesday.",
      "The boat traveled for several hours from the state's most southerly city of Albany before the penguin was released into the Southern Ocean, but the government didn't give the distance in its statement.",
      "He had been cared for by registered wildlife caregiver Carol Biddulph, who named him Gus after the first Roman emperor Augustus.",
      "\"I really didn't know whether he was going to make it to begin with because he was so undernourished,\" Biddulph said in video recorded before the bird's release, shared by the government on Friday.",
      "\"I'll miss Gus. It's been an incredible few weeks, something I wouldn't have missed,\" she added.",
      "Biddulph said she had found from caring for other species of lone penguins that mirrors were an important part of their rehabilitation by providing a comforting sense of company.",
      "\"He absolutely loves his big mirror and I think that has been crucial in his well-being. They're social birds and he stands next to the mirror most of the time,\" she said.",
      "Gus gained weight in her care, from 47 pounds when he was found to 54 pounds. He is 39 inches tall. A healthy male emperor penguin can weigh more than 100 pounds.",
      "The largest penguin species has never been reported in Australia before, University of Western Australia research fellow Belinda Cannell said, though some had reached New Zealand, nearly all of which is farther south than Western Australia.",

      "Emperor penguins have been known to cover up to 1,000 miles on foraging journeys that last up to a month, the government said.",
      "They are among the species directly threatened by the rising temperature of the oceans and seas across the world. According to The World Wildlife Foundation, about three-quarters of the world's breeding colonies of emperor penguins are vulnerable to fluctuations in the annual sea\u00a0ice cover in the Antarctic, which have become far more erratic due to climate change.",

    "summary": "A volcano erupted in southern Iceland, near the town of Grindav\u00edk and the Blue Lagoon spa, marking the region's seventh eruption in a year.",
    "story": [
      "A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland flared again late Wednesday night, marking the region's seventh eruption in just one year.",
      "Lava burst from a crack in the ground before midnight local time, originating in a spot where there has been a resurgence of volcanic activity. It happened quickly and sent a molten stream traveling toward the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's most famous tourist attraction. It's a geothermal spa set in a lava field just outside the town of Grindav\u00edk that draws nearly a million visitors each year.",
      "Tourists were evacuated from the Blue Lagoon, Iceland's national broadcaster R\u00daV\u00a0reported. Some can be seen venturing startlingly close to the magma, in an apparent effort to capture the eruption on their phones, in a video published by the broadcaster. Response crews ushered them to safety before the magma roiled farther over the area, covering a section of the parking lot adjacent to the Blue Lagoon as well as a critical pipeline that funnels hot water from a geothermal power station, called Svartsengi, into the spa and around the peninsula.",
      "Striking aerial footage of the situation also published by R\u00daV showed the expanse of the eruption. Fiery magma blankets the ground in the video, and thick smoke rises from it into the air.",
      "People were evacuated from about 50 homes Wednesday in Grindav\u00edk, a small fishing town on Iceland's southern peninsula, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The agency said it was unclear exactly which volcano was erupting, but noted the lava came from the same area experiencing volcanic activity.\u00a0Grindav\u00edk is some 30 miles south of Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland's capital city. Icelandic officials have not reported issues in the capital caused by the eruption.",
      "Officials said Thursday that volcanic activity was ongoing, with seismic monitors indicating the magma had spread over at least 7 square kilometers of land, slightly less than 4 1/2 square miles. The Njar\u00f0v\u00edk pipeline could still function Thursday beneath the magma, said the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Magma had crossed the road into Grindav\u00edk when the office shared its most recent update, but the eruption's peak had seemingly passed by then and the fissure from which it originated had shortened, according to measurements taken by the National Police Commissioner's special forces unit.",
      "Earthquakes in the area caused the ground to split and triggered the volcano, the office said. Iceland is situated on top of a rift between two tectonic plates, which makes the island nation vulnerable to\u00a0earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which have rocked portions of the country and displaced residents in recent years.",
      "It was the seventh time Iceland's Reykjanes peninsula experienced a volcanic eruption since December 2023, with multiple previous flares breaking out over the summer. Officials said the latest eruption was less severe than the last one, which happened in August and resulted in multiple ground fissures as well as a subsequent 4.1-magnitude earthquake. The August incident came just two months after an eruption continued spewing lava for more than three weeks.",
      "At the time, a regional police chief told Icelandic media that most of Grindav\u00edk's 4,000 residents had evacuated from their homes the prior November when the spell of volcanic activity started to kick up. While some had returned part-time to the town, few were comfortable staying overnight, the police chief said. Those who had returned were successfully evacuated.",
      "Before the Mount Fagradalsfjall eruption in March 2021, the Reykjanes peninsula had not seen volcanic activity in roughly 800 years. Since then, seismologists have carefully observed the reawakening of a long-dormant fault line running under the landscape.",

      "Once the pine cones are collected, they're brought to a network of nurseries, where the seeds are extracted and grown into seedlings. One million seedlings will plant about 4,500 acres of new forest.",
      "But the program alone is not enough to restore the forest, said Brian Reatini, a geneticist with the U.S. Forest Service. He says they're short about 200,000 acres \u2014 and that's just in one part of Oregon.",
      "The warming environment also means fewer seedlings will likely grow to maturity, which takes about 20 years.",
      "\"It's become much more arid, hotter and dryer. One of the consequences of that, it can push trees towards the edge of what they can physiologically tolerate,\" Reatini said.",
      "To help combat that problem, they're sourcing seeds from more \"drought tolerant\" tree species.",
      "The demand for stock now requires all hands on deck. Logging companies like Collins Pine are helping the Forest Service source pine cones and clear scorched land for replanting.",
      "\"Fire and ecology and insects and disease \u2014 it doesn't care about a property line. So if we're able to replant our little block of land, but we're surrounded by untreated, burned forest land, eventually that's just gonna become a brush field and it will burn again and threaten our land again,\" said Galen Smith, the company's vice president of resources.",
      "Neighbors are helping neighbors in a program the Forest Service hopes to expand to other impacted states.",
      "When he looks at the seedlings, Kittler said he sees \"the forests that will be walked through by our children and our children's children.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed new protections for giraffes, saying their populations are threatened by poaching, habitat loss and climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Giraffe populations are in trouble \u2014 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday proposed listing three subspecies of the tall animals as endangered and two species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their populations have been declining because of poaching, habitat loss and climate change, officials said. While giraffes are not native to the U.S., listing them under the act would still provide protections to giraffe populations.",
      "The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1973, establishes protections for fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Under the act, federal agencies are required to ensure their actions are unlikely to jeopardize listed species, according to the agency.",
      "\"Federal protections for giraffes will help protect a vulnerable species, foster biodiversity, support ecosystem health, combat wildlife trafficking, and promote sustainable economic practices,\" USFWS Director Martha Williams said in a press release. \"This action supports giraffe conservation while ensuring the United States does not contribute further to their decline.\"",
      "Specifically, officials said the listing would help giraffes by reducing the illegal hunting and trade of giraffes by requiring permits for import into the U.S. Trade is not the primary factor behind population decline, but it is playing a role, USFWS said. Their hair and tails have long been used in traditional medicine, the agency added, and in recent years giraffes have also been targeted by hunters for bushmeat.",
      "Listing them under the Endangered Species Act would also increase funding for species conservation in range countries and for research efforts to address conservation. It would also provide some limited financial support for developing and managing programs to conserve giraffes, the USFWS said.",
      "Giraffe subspecies from across Africa are at risk, according to the agency. The service proposed listing West African, Kordofan and Nubian giraffes as endangered. It also proposed listing Masai and reticulated giraffes as threatened.",
      "The West African, Kordofan and Nubian \u2014 all subspecies of the northern giraffe \u2014 have seen their population fall around 77% since 1985, according to federal officials. There are around 5,900 left, including only about 690 West African giraffes remain.",
      "The vast majority of reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, and their population is estimated at 15,985, according to USFWS. There are around 45,400 Masai giraffes \u2014 an amount roughly equivalent to 67% of their population in the 1970s.",
      "Giraffes feed on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits, so human population growth and habitat loss can hurt the species. Instances of drought have also led to increased human-wildlife conflicts.",
      "The proposed rule to list the giraffe species has a 90-day comment period.",

      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in\u00a0fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",
      "Daisy Grandlinard was among the parents who accompanied a group of children to see the whale Monday. As they drew closer, they could smell it, she said.",
      "\"It was really interesting for the kids to be able to feel it, touch the bottom because it kind of had tracks on it, like a sled almost. And just to see the size of it, that was pretty cool,\" she said. \"We had already studied whales a couple of weeks ago, so it was fun to see one in person and say, 'Oh, that's what the baleen looks like in real life,' and 'Where is the blow hole?'\"",
      "Biologists hoped to complete their work Tuesday, untether the carcass and \"let the tide push it or move it,\" Mahoney said. \"Whatever it does or doesn't do \u2014 we don't know.\"",
      "According to NOAA, the whaling industry killed nearly 725,000 fin whales in the mid-1900's in the Southern Hemisphere alone. Today, the major threat to the species comes from vessel strikes.",
      "Other fin whales have washed ashore along the Western U.S. this year. In August, a large fin whale washed ashore in Southern California and died before rescuers could get to the scene, CBS Los Angeles reported. Officials said the whale, which was not fully grown, was believed to be in poor health due to visible bumps on its skin and a thin build.",

      "With President-elect Donald Trump and newly-minted\u00a0efficiency czar\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful rocket on its sixth test flight Tuesday, an up-and-down trip to space by a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate a variety of safety and performance upgrades.",
      "Shattering the afternoon calm with an ear-splitting roar, the huge 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket blasted off from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville at 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "With its 33 Raptor engines gulping 40,000 pounds of liquid oxygen and methane fuel per second, the Super Heavy-Starship majestically climbed away to the east over the Gulf of Mexico atop a brilliant plume of white-hot flame and a churning cloud of exhaust.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, after pushing the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the Starship's six Raptor engines ignited to continue the climb to space while the Super Heavy booster fell away, reversed course and began flying back to the launch site.",
      "The flight plan called for the Super Heavy to fly back to its launch pad for capture by a giant set of mechanical arms. But an issue of some sort, either with the rocket or the capture mechanism on the pad, prompted flight controllers to order a diversion to splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "As it was, the final descent appeared normal and well controlled as the rocket restarted three Raptors to slow is rate of fall before settling to a vertical, low-speed splashdown just off shore Boca Chica while the Starship upper stage continued on into space.",
      "The International Space Station was passing 260 miles above eastern Mexico at the moment of liftoff.",
      "\"We just saw Starship launch,\" astronaut Sunita Williams radioed. \"Pretty awesome! We're getting pictures.\" Crewmate Don Pettit told flight controllers in Houston \"it looked pretty cool from orbit. We're downloading them now.\"",
      "Trump attends the SpaceX Starship launch",
      "Trump flew to Texas earlier in the afternoon and watched the launch and booster recovery with Musk. During a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump urged Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "His reaction to watching the giant rocket take off and land was not immediately known.",
      "Ahead of the launch, Trump\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "As with the rocket's fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight was to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster executed the return-to-launch-site mid-air capture or, as it turned out, a safe ocean splashdown.",
      "But this time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines was successfully restarted in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also were testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its website, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "Spectacular video from cameras mounted on the Starship showed a sheath of super-hot plasma engulfing the vehicle as it rapidly slowed in a blaze of atmospheric friction.",
      "And even though it was using an older-generation heat shield and flying in a deliberately more difficult-to-control orientation, the Starship executed a picture-perfect splashdown, firing three Raptors to slow down for a vertical descent into the ocean.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

      "In total, these five online tools correctly identified the tested videos nearly 75% of the time. The I-Team reached out to the companies with the results; their responses are below.",
      "Deepware",
      "Deepware, a website that's free to use, initially failed to flag two of the fake videos the I-Team tested. In an email, the company said the clips used were too short and that for the best results, videos uploaded should be between 30 seconds and one minute. Deepware correctly identified all videos that were longer. According to the company, its detection rate is considered good for the industry at 70%.",
      "The frequently asked questions section of Deepware's website states: \"Deepfakes are not a solved problem yet. Our results indicate the likelihood of a specific video being a deepfake or not.\"",

    "summary": "Daisy's mission is two-fold: To waste scammers' time so they can't speak to real people and to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant.",
    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Nov 2024 19:47:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed breakup calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department calls for Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions designed to prevent its Android smartphone software from favoring its search engine.",
      "The recommended penalties underscore how severely regulators operating under President Biden believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded Google as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day.",
      "If Mehta embraces the Justice Department's recommendations, Google will almost certainly appeal the punishments, prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years.",
      "Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices.",
      "Regulators also want Google to share data it collects from people's queries with its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant.",
      "The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year \u2014 a moneymaking machine that has given Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\"The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"",
      "It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division.",
      "Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged business deals from getting done during the past four years.",
      "Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on the alternative penalties he might have in mind. \"What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,\" Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies.",
      "Gaetz, a firebrand for Trump, faces a tough confirmation hearing.",
      "This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties.",
      "But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and \u2014 by extension \u2014 Mehta's ruling.",
      "Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling.",
      "It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and Android should be unbundled from the company's other services.",
      "Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition.",
      "However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.",

      "Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.",
      "Here's what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \"digital alternative\" to traditional money \u2014 but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "Trump's election win boosts crypto",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies,\u00a0pledged during his campaign\u00a0against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve.\" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.",
      "Spot bitcoin ETFs",
      "Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.",
      "A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.\u00a0 Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency\u00a0exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.",
      "Inflows into spot ETFs, \"have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,\" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.",
      "Bitcoin volatility",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "How bitcoin mining works",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \"mining,\" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Cryptocurrency is making lots of noise, literally",

      "The FCC may not be a household name to most Americans, but the agency enforces communications laws, runs programs to help communities gain access to high-speed internet and regulates communications services, including satellite internet access, among other tasks. But under Carr, the agency may pivot to some new priorities during Trump's next term, with a renewed focus on battling big technology companies and Chinese-based telecom firms.",
      "\"The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving four main goals,\" including \"reining in Big Tech,\" Carr wrote in his chapter on the FCC in Project 2025, a policy blueprint published by the Heritage Foundation.",
      "Here's what to know about Carr's priorities.",
      "How might the FCC deal with tech giants?",
      "In Project 2025, Carr highlighted what he believes is a need for a new approach to dealing with tech giants such as Google, Meta and others.",
      "\"Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information we consume to the places we shop,\" Carr wrote in the document. \"These corporate behemoths are not merely exercising market power, they are abusing dominant positions.\"",
      "The FCC should restrict immunity from Section 230, part of a law that says tech companies aren't liable if a user posts something libelous, as well as tamp down the businesses' ability to \"censor protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections,\" he wrote.",
      "Carr also wants tech companies to be more transparent about their algorithm changes and their decisions to block or demonetize users.",
      "What are Carr's views on Elon Musk?",
      "Carr has built an alliance with billionaire Musk, the world's wealthiest person who backed Trump's campaign and whose Starlink satellite internet service could benefit from access to federal cash.",
      "In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, Carr pointed to Musk as an example of how the federal government doesn't treat people fairly, noting that a grant of almost $900 million to Musk's Starlink was \"revoked unlawfully.\" Last year, the FCC said it rejected the grant because of lack of proof that Starlink would be able to provide service to hundreds of thousands of rural properties.",
      "\"It is time for the American government to not give people different treatment based on their last name,\" Carr told Fox News. \"Everybody will get a fair shake from the government going forward.\"",
      "What about his views on TikTok and Chinese businesses?",
      "In his Project 2025 chapter, Carr singled out TikTok and other Chinese-owned businesses as potential threats to U.S. security.",
      "\"As law enforcement officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to America's national security,\" Carr wrote. \"It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans.\"",
      "That would align his views along those with the Biden administration, with the president\u00a0signing a law in April that would require TikTok to be sold or else banned from the U.S.",
      "Carr also wrote that he believes the FCC needs to do more to monitor and restrict Chinese telecom and tech businesses from operating within the U.S.",
      "What does Carr say about broadcasters?",
      "Carr has taken aim at some broadcasters, including CBS News, echoing Trump's claims that they engage in political bias. For instance, Carr singled out NBC for including Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit before the election.",
      "\"This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule,\" Carr wrote on X on November 2. \"The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\"",
      "After Trump announced Carr's pick, Carr said on X that he will ensure the FCC \"will enforce\" laws that call on broadcasters \"to operate in the public interest.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly called to strip major broadcasters such as ABC, NBC and CBS of their licenses. During the 2024 campaign, Trump\u00a0sued CBS News\u00a0over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Harris, alleging the network used \"deceitful\" editing of her responses. CBS News has called the president-elect's claims \"completely without merit\" and added it intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "What do supporters and critics say about Carr?",
      "Trump praised Carr as \"a warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement announcing his selection. Fellow FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks, a Democrat, described Carr as \"a dedicated public servant and a recognized leader on the many issues before the Commission today.\"",
      "But some critics have flagged some of Carr's stances, with the nonpartisan public interest group Free Press describing his relationship with Musk as well as his stance on broadcasters as problematic.",
      "\"While styling himself as a free-speech champion, Carr refused to stand up when Trump threatened to take away the broadcast licenses of TV stations for daring to fact check him during the campaign,\" Free Press Action Co-CEO Craig Aaron said in a statement. \"This alone should be disqualifying.\"",
      "Free Press and Fight for the Future, an advocacy group focused on digital rights, both have cited concerns about net neutrality, a policy that ensures internet service providers treat all websites and online content equally. Net neutrality was overturned during the first Trump administration, but was restored during Biden's term.",
      "\"Trump's nomination of Brendan Carr, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, to head the FCC is more than just a reversal of popular policies like net neutrality,\" said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, said in an email. \"Carr has made clear he actually wants the FCC to get more involved in policing online speech.\"",

    "summary": "The death of music star Liam Payne has thrust \"pink cocaine,\" sometimes also called Tusi, into the national spotlight. The National Drug Early Warning System predicted its rise back in 2023.",
    "story": [
      "The death of music star Liam Payne.  Sex trafficking allegations against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. A deadly car crash involving an Instagram model. Many Americans have only recently learned of the drug known as \"pink cocaine\" from a deluge of celebrity horror stories. Joseph Palamar, an associate professor of population health at NYU Langone, would say they are late to the party.",
      "\"A lot of people just think it's this new powder that's going around,\" Palamar said. \"It's a pretty pink powder, and everyone's starting to use it, when it really started increasing was around mid-2023.\"",
      "\"The chatter increases before a lot of poisonings occur\"",
      "When Palamar first heard of pink cocaine, his team immediately scoured posts on Reddit as part of his research for the National Drug Early Warning System. The organization specializes in narcotics surveillance and collects data on drugs that could rise in popularity and lethality.",
      "\"We've looked at other drugs, and what we found ... is that a lot of times the chatter increases before a lot of poisonings occur,\" said Palamar.",
      "Palamar explained there's a whole community called \"Psychonauts,\" in which people use novel drugs or induce \"altered states of consciousness\" and post about their experiences. For drug use, Palamar equated it to a diary to alert people to the effects of drugs.",
      "Standing in front of a chart that resembles a stock rally on Wall Street, Palamar explained how each Reddit post about pink cocaine represents a data point he uses to better predict drug trends and warn the public.",
      "\"When we detect a trend, we alert everybody we could possibly think of,\" he said. \"We alert departments of health, academics, people who use. We want to spread our information pretty widely in order to prevent use. It's concerning because it's already high, and it's increasing. We already have dozens of people talking about it per day.\"",
      "The warning system first issued an alert on pink cocaine in February 2023, when researchers noticed a spike in chatter from Redditors. That chatter nearly doubled to more than 30 posts per day by the summer.",
      "\"It appears that the chatter on average is now higher,\" Palamar said. \"It's more consistent. We don't have dips as low as previous years.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Reddit for a comment on the research. A spokesperson said its policies ban the buying or selling drugs, and most conversations on its message boards are warning other Reddit users about pink cocaine.",
      "Similar trends emerged with carfentanyl, a synthetic opioid 100 times more potent than its lethal sister-drug fentanyl. Nearly 80,000 Americans have died from poisonings linked to carfentanyl in the past two years, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse.",
      "\"Don't play with this stuff... It's a powerful substance.\"",
      "One pink cocaine user, who takes the drug at least once a month, agreed to speak with CBS News without revealing her identity. She said she tests each batch for fentanyl but admits she doesn't otherwise know the contents of the drug mixtures she's buying.",
      "\"You don't know what is in it every time.\" she said. \"You don't know what is inside ... there are the ingredients that make you dance. There are ingredients that can make you feel more chill. There are ingredients can make you feel more trippy.\"",
      "Those unknowns \u2014 about the substance and the high \u2014 pushed Frank Tarantino, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Agency in New York, to issue an urgent warning to CBS News New York.",
      "\"When people are seeking pink cocaine and they think they're buying pink cocaine, they're actually buying a drug that's laced with fentanyl and they have no idea and they're overdosing and dying,\" Tarantino said.",
      "The anonymous user who spoke to CBS News said she has found fentanyl in her own supply.",
      "\"I gave it back,\" she said. \"It's dangerous.\"",
      "Pink cocaine is not cocaine",
      "Pink cocaine is often confused for real cocaine. Tusi, the other street name for the substance, is often confused for the synthetic psychedelic 2C-B. It's neither.",
      "Pink cocaine is a combination of other drugs. It is pink in color due to the addition of food coloring, and sometimes strawberry or other flavoring, according to the National Capital Poison Center.",
      "Officials said it is most commonly used by young people in the club scene. Pink cocaine is usually either ingested in pill form or snorted as a powder. Rarely, it is injected.",
      "An analysis by CBS News found 99.5% of pink powder seized by the Drug Enforcement Agency is a mixture of ketamine and other drugs, which can include fentanyl, according to DEA data from nearly 1,000 seizures.",

    "story": [
      "A couple from Connecticut faces charges for allegedly taking part in an intricate retail theft operation targeting the apparel company Lululemon that may have amounted to $1 million worth of stolen items, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "The couple, Jadion Anthony Richards, 44, and Akwele Nickeisha Lawes-Richards, 45, were arrested Nov. 14 in Woodbury, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Richards and Lawes-Richards have been charged with one count each of organized retail theft, which is a felony, the Ramsey County Attorney's Office said. They are from Danbury, Connecticut.",
      "The alleged operation impacted Lululemon stores in multiple states, including Minnesota.",
      "\"Because of the outstanding work of the Roseville Police investigators \u2014 including their new Retail Crime Unit \u2014 as well as other law enforcement agencies, these individuals accused of this massive retail theft operation have been caught,\" a spokesperson for the attorney's office said in a statement on Nov. 18. \"We will do everything in our power to hold these defendants accountable and continue to work with our law enforcement partners and retail merchants to put a stop to retail theft in our community.\"",
      "Both Richards and Lawes-Richards have posted bond as of Sunday and agreed to the terms of a court-ordered conditional release, according to the county attorney. For Richards, the court had set bail at $100,000 with conditional release, including weekly check-ins, or $600,000 with unconditional release. For Lawes-Richards, bail was set at $30,000 with conditional release and weekly check-ins or $200,000 with unconditional release. They are scheduled to appear again in court Dec. 16.",
      "Prosecutors had asked for $1 million bond to be placed on each half of the couple, the attorney's office said.",
      "Richards and Lawes-Richards are accused by authorities of orchestrating a convoluted retail theft scheme that dates back to at least September. Their joint arrests came one day after the couple allegedly set off store alarms while trying to leave a Lululemon in Roseville, Minnesota, and an organized retail crime investigator, identified in charging documents by the initials R.P., recognized them.",
      "The couple were allowed to leave the Roseville store. But the investigator later told an officer who responded to the incident that Richards and Lawes-Richards were seasoned shoplifters, who apparently stole close to $5,000 worth of Lululemon items just that day and were potentially \"responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in loss to the store across the country,\" according to the complaint. That number was eventually estimated by an investigator for the brand   to be even higher, with the criminal complaint placing it at as much as $1 million.",
      "Richards and Lawes-Richards allegedly involved other individuals in their shoplifting pursuits, but none were identified by name in the complaint. Authorities said they were able to successfully pull off the thefts by distracting store employees and later committing fraudulent returns with the stolen items at different Lululemon stores.",
      "\"Between October 29, 2024 and October 30, 2024, RP documented eight theft incidents in Colorado involving Richards and Lawes-Richards and an unidentified woman,\" authorities wrote in the complaint, describing an example of how the operation would allegedly unfold.",
      "\"The group worked together using specific organized retail crime tactics such as blocking and distraction of associates to commit large thefts,\" the complaint said. \"They selected coats and jackets and held them up as if they were looking at them in a manner that blocked the view of staff and other guests while they selected and concealed items. They removed security sensors using a tool of some sort at multiple stores.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser to Donald Trump, said Sunday that the upcoming months will be \"really critical\" in determining the \"next phase\" of the war in Ukraine as the president-elect is expected to work to force a negotiated settlement when he enters office.",
      "McMaster, a CBS News contributor, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that Russia and Ukraine are both incentivized to make \"as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in\" as the two countries seek leverage in negotiations.",
      "With an eye toward strengthening Ukraine's standing before President-elect Donald Trump returns to office in the new year, the Biden administration agreed in recent days to provide anti-personnel land mines for use, while lifting restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-made longer range missiles to strike within Russian territory. The moves come as Ukraine marked more than 1,000 days since Russia's invasion in February 2022.",
      "Meanwhile, many of Trump's key selection for top posts in his administration \u2014 Rep. Mike Waltz for national security adviser and Sens. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and JD Vance for Vice President \u2014 haven't been supportive of providing continued assistance to Ukraine, or have advocated for a negotiated end to the war.",
      "McMaster said the dynamic is \"a real problem\" and delivers a \"psychological blow to the Ukrainians.\"",
      "\"Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts, and it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail,\" he said. \"And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.\"",
      "McMaster said he's hopeful that Trump's picks, and the president-elect himself, will \"begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.\" He cited the North Korean soldiers fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II, the efforts China is taking to \"sustain Russia's war-making machine,\" and the drones and missiles Iran has provided as part of the broader picture.",
      "\"So I think what's happened is so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine, and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world,\" McMaster said.",
      "On Trump's selections for top national security and defense posts, McMaster stressed the importance of the Senate's advice and consent role in making sure \"the best people are in those positions.\"",
      "McMaster outlined that based on his experience, Trump listens to advice and learns from those around him. And he argued that the nominees for director of national intelligence and defense secretary should be asked key questions like how they will \"reconcile peace through strength,\" and what they think \"motivates, drives and constrains\" Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump has tapped former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, who has been criticized for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries. McMaster said Sunday that Gabbard has a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" about what motivates Putin.",
      "More broadly, McMaster said he \"can't understand\" the Republicans who \"tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points,\" saying \"they've got to disabuse themselves of this strange affection for Vladimir Putin.\"",
      "Meanwhile, when asked about Trump's recent selection of Sebastian Gorka as senior director for counterterrorism and deputy assistant to the president, McMaster said he doesn't think Gorka is a good person to advise the president-elect on national security. But he noted that \"the president, others who are working with him, will probably determine that pretty quickly.\"",

And we've \u2013 we've had a distrust of putting the Army into our streets, because the police have a difficult job, but the police understand the Fourth Amendment. They have to go to judges. They have to get warrants. It has to be specific.",

And people need to realize that what he is - - what he is offering is a form of insurrection, where the states resist the federal government.",
      "Most people objected to that and rejected that long ago. So I think the mayor of Denver is on the wrong side of history, and, really, I think, will face legal ramifications if he doesn't obey the federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just context on those numbers you rattled off in terms of criminals, those numbers from ICE are accurate figures, but they're over a 40-year period of time.",
      "What we know now about the immigration authorities who would have to be charged with rounding these individuals up, there are just 6,000 agents, 41,000 detention beds to carry out the assignment of rounding up millions of undocumented people, potentially.",
      "How do you suggest they implement it? And if this is a red line for you in terms of using the military, would you vote no on the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image.",
      "But I will tell you that, just in the last week, with the belief that a new administration will change things, there were four or five criminals arrested in the last week. And what would happen and I think what will happen under Donald Trump's administration is, I don't recommend to use the Army, but I would use the FBI, I would use ICE, I would use Border Patrol.",
      "And they have a list now of 15,000. I don't care if it came in over 40 years or 10 years. If you've got a list, you put these people on an all- points bulletin, these are the kind of people that are dangerous and that everybody needs to be the watch on, and they would go out and seek those people.",
      "That \u2013 we have about 30,000 very dangerous people already convicted of crimes. That should be the first priority for all of this. Let's go find those people. But it's not about detaining them. In all likelihood, they should be going to a jail, either a jail here or in the country they came from.",
      "So I think, if we did that, there will be a lot of unity. If they send the Army into New York, and you have 10,000 troops marching, carrying semiautomatic weapons, I think it's a terrible image, and I will oppose that. But it's not that I oppose removing people. I just\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 object to what has been against the law for over 100 years, and that's using the Army.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But deputizing the National Guard, that specifically is the proposal. You also oppose that?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think it's the best way to do it. It's less clear whether that's legal or illegal. Typically, it has to be done at the behest of the governors.",
      "I still don't like a militarization of police, whether it's National Guard or Army. I think there's a lot of FBI.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: There's a lot of Border Patrol agents. There's a better way to do it. And it needs to be individualized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: That doesn't mean I'm any less serious about getting it done. It just needs to be done according to the law and consistent with our traditions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You've made clear you are a fiscal conservative. I want to ask you about the choice just made to select hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as the treasury secretary. He had a long financial career. He served as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros' funds. He's been a political donor.",
      "Elon Musk came out publicly against him, calling him business as usual. Do you favor Mr. Bessent in the role as Treasury secretary?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I have heard good things about him. I haven't made a decision. I lean towards being supportive.",
      "I don't like tariffs, but, then again, I don't like the president promoting tariffs. I think tariffs are a tax on the consumer, and they ignore things like with steel. There are 80 workers working in steel-buying industry for every worker making steel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, yes, you can protect certain industries, but it's at the expense of other people.",
      "I don't believe that will be enough for me to want to vote against Bessent, because it's also the president's position as well. I will be vocal in saying that I think tariffs are bad and that international trade actually saves every consumer about $7,000 a year. So, everybody in our country is $7,000 richer because of international trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's part of one of the booms of postwar and post- Industrial Revolution. This amazing international trade has made us all richer, and we need to talk about the statistics and facts concerning the benefits of trade.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood on the nuances and specifics there, but that is primarily how Donald Trump is promising to pay for all the things he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "As you know, the federal debt is past $36 trillion as of this week. His proposals to lift taxes off of tips, overtime, Medicare, Social Security, give tax credits, that could add as much as $8 trillion more to the deficit, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.",
      "Do you actually expect Republicans to take up these proposals?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, in 2017, I voted for a tax reduction package that they said would add to the debt, but I also forced my colleagues to vote for pay-as-you-go. It's a policy that's in our law, and they have to waive it, which means that if a tax cut causes a reduction and causes an increase in the debt because of reduced revenue, that you have to have spending cuts.",
      "So, I have always been in favor of the tax cuts, but I have also been in favor of the spending cuts. The same will occur with this. If we do cut spend \u2013 cut taxes, which I think helps the economy, you leave money in the hands of the productive private sector, I think that's a good idea. But if you do it, I would cut spending.",
      "And there will be procedural blockade or procedural votes that I will force that says that we should also cut spending as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that the vast majority of Americans, 86 percent, prefer people with experience running the agencies, and 64 percent polled by us think it's important to appoint people with that experience in Washington.",
      "Given that, for example, the Pentagon pick hasn't ever managed a large corporation or held a high rank in the military, do you think he can run the Pentagon?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "And I think the vast majority of people, if you poll them, will say that they don't think people should be picked based on religion or gender or sexuality. They want people to be picked on merit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And one of one of Pete Hegseth's criticisms of our Pentagon is that we've gone away from merit\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 and gone more towards racial characteristics.",
      "And so I think that the people are and would be overwhelmingly in favor\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 of someone who's going to base hiring on merit, not on racial characteristics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of the state of Illinois. She sits on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois): Good morning. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, former Congressman Matt Gaetz took himself out of the running this week to become attorney general.",
      "This was after he had met with senators. And CBS has reported that as many as 15 Republicans opposed him. Does that suggest to you that your Republican colleagues in the Senate will hold the line, or are you still concerned they will just green-light anyone Trump nominates?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I'm deeply concerned that they will green- light. I'm glad that they held the line on him.",
      "I'm also glad that they voted the way they did for the Republican leader, but that was in the secret ballot when they elected Senator Thune. And, you know, Mr. Trump's main choice for that position was not selected.",
      "But from what I'm hearing from my Republican colleagues on everything from defense secretary to other posts, it sounds like they are ready to roll over for Mr. Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that point of Defense, since you sit in this advisory role on Armed Services, I don't have to tell you, but, for our audience, there are over 200,000 American women who serve in active duty service right now, thousands of them in front-line combat roles.",
      "You were one of them in 2004, when your Black Hawk helicopter you were piloting was shot at by an RPG, and you sustained severe injuries.",
      "Here is what Mr. Trump's pick for defense secretary said about women serving:",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary Nominee): I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your colleagues who sit with you on Armed Services believe that Mr. Hegseth's statement there is an issue that he needs to perhaps retract?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think they need to, because he's wrong.",
      "Our military could not go to war without the 220,000-plus women who serve in uniform. The women in our military does make us more effective, does make us more lethal.",
      "And let me just make one thing clear. The women who are in those very particular roles, whether it's in Special Forces or the SEALs or the infantry, they meet the same standards as the men. And so he's been out there saying that, you know, women are not as strong, we don't \u2013 the ones who are in those roles have met the same standards as the men and have passed the very rigorous testing.",
      "And so he's just flat-out wrong. Our military could not go to war without the women who wear this uniform. And, frankly, America's daughters are just as capable of defending liberty and freedom as her sons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Having served in combat yourself, what do you think of the idea that women make fighting more complicated? That was specifically what he focused on.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, it just shows his lack of understanding of where our military is.",
      "He was a pretty low-ranking guy in the military, and he never had a command position. He was a platoon leader, I think, once or twice, but he never even commanded a company. And so this is a man who is inordinately unqualified for the position.",
      "Remember that the Pentagon is three million servicemen and women and civilians. It is over a $900 billion budget. He's never, you know, run anything anywhere near to that size. And, frankly, women actually make our military more effective.",
      "And I have personally found that I brought many insights to my job when I was a company commander, when I was a logistics officer that came from my own personal background that made things better. I took better care of my men, for example, in my unit. I was often the only woman in an all-male unit, and my gender didn't have \u2013 wasn't a problem.",
      "I just adapted, and we continued to perform the mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The question of character has also come up in regard to this leadership role. Mr. Hegseth has acknowledged that he paid a woman back in 2017 to quiet her accusations of sexual assault. He claims it was consensual sex.",
      "I'm sure you read that Monterey police report, as we did here. It refers to the offense code as \u2013 quote \u2013 \"rape, victim unconscious of the nature of the act.\" It details both the accuser's and Hegseth's version of events.",
      "Here's what Senator Markwayne Mullin said it shows: \"two people flirting with each other.\"",
      "Is the committee going to speak with the victim to ask if this was a misunderstanding?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, that's \u2013 that will be the decision of the Republican chairman of the committee next year.",
      "I hope that we will. But I suspect that they, again, will roll over for Mr. Trump. Frankly, I will make \u2013 raise those questions. Remember that we've just fought over a decade of fights and \u2013 and overhauled the military and its treatment of military sexual trauma.",
      "It's frankly an insult and really troubling that Mr. Trump would nominate someone who has admitted that he's paid off a victim who has claimed rape allegations against him. This is not the kind of person you want to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To move to a vote you took this past week, you said you have disgust at the brutal tactics used by the Netanyahu government in Gaza, but you voted against all three resolutions of disapproval this past week that would have paused very specific offensive weapons shipments to Israel.",
      "Your colleague Senator Van Hollen said it's just about getting Israel to comply with U.S. law. How do you respond to that? Why shouldn't they be held to the same standards as other recipients of U.S. aid?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I respect Senator Van Hollen's position. And, in fact, I have cosigned many of the letters that he's led that has called on Israel to comply with humanitarian standards across the world.",
      "My decision comes from my military experience, the fact that many of these rounds were not going to be delivered for a couple of years, the fact that, you know, these are resolutions. They don't actually have binding effect. And, frankly, for me, my decision came from the fact that we have tens of thousands of US troops in harm's way right now.",
      "And I am deeply concerned that a resolution that doesn't actually do anything might embolden the Houthis and the Iranian regime and Hamas to further target and \u2013 American troops abroad. So I respect Chris. He and I are good friends. We were freshmen in the Senate together, but we come at this from slightly different angles, mine from 23 years of military experience.",
      "But I do share his concern about the brutal way that Israel has acted in Gaza. And, you know, I have cosigned many of his letters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our polling shows that there is a desire among the American people to see Democrats and Republicans work together in this future Trump administration.",
      "With that in mind, I'm looking at some of these nominees, including Trump's pick for labor secretary. She is drawing praise from unions because she is perceived as \u2013 as pro-union. Could you see yourself supporting her or any of the other nominees?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Absolutely.",
      "I \u2013 you know, what I would need to do is have a chance to sit down and talk with each one of these nominees, and listen to them and hear what they have to say. I think Congressman Collins over at VA, he's the nominee for VA, is another person I can talk with. In fact, I worked with him when I was in the House a few years back.",
      "I am going to evaluate each one of these candidates based on their ability to do the job and their willingness to put the needs of the American people first and not be on a retribution campaign and a \u2013 for Mr. Trump.",
      "So it's about, are they willing to be independent and do the job that they are being nominated to do, and are they competent and qualified for the position?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, we appreciate your time this morning.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're now joined by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): It's great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in these final days of Democratic control of the Senate and the White House, there's a long to-do list. Congress has to fund the government by end of December, pass the defense bill, the NDAA, an extension to the farm bill, and I know Democrats want to confirm as many judges as possible. What's top of your list?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, all of those are on the list. Top of my list is also the disaster relief funding. Emergency relief. We had big parts of the country hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. In my state of Maryland, we had the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. So, we've always taken the approach that the whole country will be there to help fellow Americans in need. The president has now submitted $100 billion emergency disaster relief plan that includes funding for the Key Bridge. So, I hope that we will get that done by the end of the year. People need that relief and they need it now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about $8 billion for the bridge alone, is that right?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Not for the bridge alone. This is - that's part of the emergency relief fund that includes approximately $2 billion for the bridge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And you're relatively confident that this can be delivered on?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I hope that all of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, will support disaster relief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've always had the philosophy, all for one and one for all when Americans get hit by these disasters. I hope we will stick with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we also are looking at a new Congress very soon and, as you know, a new commander in chief. Republicans will have the majority in the Senate with 53 seats, so they don't really need Democratic votes to confirm many of the picks that Mr. Trump has been making to run agencies.",
      "But from what you've seen to date, are you in favor of any of them, your colleague, Marco Rubio, as secretary of State, for example, or this new choice to be Labor secretary?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, my view is, this is what the vetting process is all about, the hearing process. The Senate, of course, under the Constitution, has the job of advising and consenting on nominations. And I take that responsibility very seriously.",
      "I've been troubled by some talk that President-elect Donald Trump wants to short circuit that constitutional approach using this recess appointment device, and it will be really important that the new republican leader in the Senate uphold the Senate's prerogatives under the Constitution and not try to do an end run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned to see how that plays out.",
      "Let's turn to the Middle East. You said that President Biden's inaction to halt the horrific humanitarian situation inside of Gaza is a stain on his administration, that it's shameful. Is there anything in these final weeks that could be done to erase that stain?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think there are things that can be done. And I should emphasize that I supported President Biden's decision to travel to Israel in the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks of October 7th of last year, and stand with the people of Israel as they confront this threat. But I also wish the president had effectively used U.S. leverage to essentially assert his own positions. We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage. So, I do hope in these closing months the president will finally make more effective use of American leverage to, at the very least, uphold American law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To insist that the Netanyahu government allows humanitarian aid into Gaza, and that they use our weapons in a manner consistent with the laws of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you take a nuanced and specific stand on that, upholding U.S. law. This is often characterized, though, as being for or against helping Israel. There were 19 senators, you were one of them, who voted this past week to pause specific shipments on three different groups of weapons, offensive weapons, to Israel. You said the State Department's reviewing 500 incidents where U.S. weapons were used and caused unnecessary civilian harm. The State Department has said Israel's doing things to fix the situation, which is why weapons continue to be green lit. Are you suggesting that's a lie?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm suggesting that the president of the United States is not fully complying with American law on this question. If you look at the letter that was sent by Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken to Israeli authorities in October, you look at that final paragraph, you'll see that they're complaining about the fact that there is no effective mechanism right now for getting to the bottom of claims of civilian harm. The State Department has, as I said, about 500, as you said, and we haven't gotten to the bottom of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Because the process is broken, and I would argue that there's not been the will to fix the process because a lot of people don't want the process to produce the obvious answer, which is, there have been many cases where we've seen U.S. weapons used in violation of the international humanitarian law. In fact, if you go back to the NSM 20 report earlier this year, the Biden administration said specifically that there was a high likelihood that U.S. weapons were being used in violation of international law, and yet they've done nothing in the intervening period to enforce that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed U.S. officials on this privately, they've said, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to put in a halt for a few weeks? And then Donald Trump reverses it. What's the point? How do you respond?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the point is, they should have been doing this for a much longer period of time. The president had ample opportunities over the last year. There are many people in the administration, senior level - at the senior level who told me that this war was going to come to an end back in January. You know, I've met with hostage families on numerous occasions who have been calling out Prime Minister Netanyahu for not agreeing to a ceasefire and a return of their loved ones. Minister Gallant, the defense minister of Israel, was fired because he wanted to prioritize the return of hostages, and yet President Biden has never called out Prime Minister Netanyahu.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: For his obstruction on this. Even though those families I've met with are calling him out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even post-election, why do you think he won't do that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I really don't know. I just don't know why the president of the United States has not been willing to make more effective use of American leverage to assert his own stated objectives. I mean he's been ignored on other things, too, right? He wants the PA to be the nucleus of governance in a post-war Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Palestinian Authority.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: He wants a two-state solution. Prime Minister Netanyahu has not only ignored those, he's gone out there and bragged about how he's blocking President Biden's efforts. And yet the blank check just keeps on coming. So, what my colleagues and I are saying is, let's just pause these transfers of offensive weapons, certain ones, until Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government come into compliance with American law. These are American laws on the books.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, this is not about whether we support Israel or not. Of course we support Israel. It's about whether our support is used in a manner consistent with American law and American values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for explaining your position.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration. His latest book is \"At War with Ourselves,\" which chronicles his time at the White House.",
      "Good morning, and welcome back.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER (Retired, Former White House National Security Adviser): Good morning, Margaret. Happy Thanksgiving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy early Thanksgiving to you.",
      "I want to ask you about the geopolitical threat picture right now that the next commander in chief will be walking into the Oval Office and facing. In these final weeks of the Biden administration, Ukraine has started using U.S.-made ATACMS, a type of longer range missile, to strike within Russian territory. President Biden also approved anti-personnel land mines. The aim is to get them on stronger footing before Trump takes office.",
      "Can these weapons quickly make a difference?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: They can make a difference, Margaret. Really it made no sense to not allow the Ukrainians to fire those missiles at the bases that Russia was using to continue their onslaught against the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian infrastructure. And so, it's another one of these example how the Biden administration has taken this halting approach to providing weapons and then permissions to use weapons.",
      "And so, I think it's - it's important because both sides right now are incentivized to make as many gains on the battlefield as they can before the new Trump administration comes in. And you see Russia throwing troops into Ukrainian defenses. I mean, they're taking - you know, they're taking tens of thousands of casualties a month. I think it's really an unsustainable rate. And what the Ukrainians are doing now is trying to protect themselves from the onslaught, inflict as many casualties as they can, and they're trading some - some space for time and the opportunity to cause more attrition on Russian forces.",
      "So, the next couple of months, I think, are really critical in terms of the - you know, how - what is the next phase in the war in Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, President Zelenskyy said just yesterday that he's sure Vladimir Putin is trying to, quote, \"push us out by January 20th,\" and try to demonstrate that he has the upper hand. He's not saying that, you know, just as an observation. He is looking at the national security adviser, Mike Waltz. He's looking at the possible next secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who has voted against Ukraine aid. The vice president-elect is against helping Ukraine. Can Ukraine get the upper hand here, and are these top advisers going to be persuadable?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is a real problem, Margaret. You know, I think what you're seeing is, this delivers a psychological blow to the Ukrainians. Ukrainians are struggling to generate the manpower that they need and to sustain their defensive efforts. And that's - it's important that they get the weapons they need and the training that they need, but also they have to have the confidence that they can prevail. And any sort of messages that we might reduce our aid are quite damaging to them from a moral perspective.",
      "I think he'll - and what I hope is that those who President Trump has nominated, and President Trump himself will begin to see the quite obvious connections between the war in Ukraine and this axis of aggressors that are doing everything they can to tear down the existing international order.",
      "I mean, heck, Margaret, I mean North Korean soldiers are fighting on European soil in the first major war in Europe since World War II. Look at what China's doing to sustain Russia's war-making machine with the cash Vladimir Putin needs but also with the equipment and the hardware necessary to build these missiles that are continuing this onslaught. Iran. Iran is providing the drones and missiles. North Korea's also providing, you know, eight million rounds of artillery. So, I think what's happened is, so many people have taken such a myopic view of Ukraine and they've misunderstood Putin's intentions and how consequential the war is to our interests across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things - and you are a historian. You've written quite a lot and looked at presidential decision making. One of the things you've written in \"At War with Ourselves\" was, \"it is important,\" based on your study of the Vietnam War, \"to ensure that the president gets the best analysis and multiple options so he can make informed decisions.\"",
      "Do you think so far that Mr. Trump's choices for director of national intelligence, for defense secretary, are these individuals who will provide the president with the best analysis and what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is what the Senate has to - has to really exercise their advice and consent role. And I think it's worth going back to Federalist 76 where John Adams said, really this advice and consent is so important to make sure the best people are in those positions. President Trump, as I wrote in the book, he does learn. He does listen to advice. He does evolve his understanding. So, who will those people be?",
      "I think for the new secretary of defense, the nominated director of national intelligence, they ought to be asked, what do you think motivates or drives and constrains Vladimir Putin? There's a fundamental misunderstanding based on - on the nominee for - for the - for DNI about what motivates him. It's not his security concerns. His security concerns don't need to be allayed. That's the mistake the Biden administration made. And I think as a result almost green lighted the invasion - the reinvasion of Ukraine in February of 2022.",
      "What are the consequences if - if Ukraine fails and Russia succeeds globally? I think, Margaret, they have got to be asked about, you know, really, how do they reconcile or help President Trump reconcile peace through strength and what you see in some elements of the Republican Party which replicate the far left oftentimes toward retrenchment and disengagement and then even blaming ourselves for the acts of our adversaries as - as - as Tulsi Gabbard has done, you know, talking about, you know, how Putin really felt aggrieved. And that's why he had to invade Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that's a Russian talking point that she's repeated and in direct contradiction (ph) to what U.S. intelligence has concluded.",
      "I also want to ask you about someone you personally -",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And this is what - this is what I can't understand, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: There's some - there's some people in the Republican Party these days who kind of tend to parrot Vladimir Putin's talking points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: I don't know if it's because they're drawn to him and they see him as a - kind of a defender of western civilization, just a shirtless guy on horseback, but they've got to disabuse themselves of this, you know, strange affection for Vladimir Putin. You know, who - who is - who is not going to stop in his efforts to restore Russia to national greatness at our expense. That's what he's obsessed with. He's obsessed with kind of re-establishing the Russian empire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And so he has aspirations that go far beyond anything that's in reaction to what we do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: And the only thing that stops him really is strength, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you wrote in your book that you didn't understand Donald Trump's fascination with Vladimir Putin.",
      "Quickly, Seb Gorka is going to be the senior director for counterterrorism, deputy assistant to the president. Is he a good person to advise on national security?",
      "LIEUTENANT GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: No, no, he's not, Margaret. But I - you know, I think that - that the president and others who are working with him will probably determine that pretty quickly soon after he gets into that job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, timestamp on that prediction. H.R. McMaster, a lot to talk to you about. We're going to have to leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The 2024 election was historic for several reasons. Among them, the first openly transgender person was elected to the United States Congress. She joins us now from the state she will be representing, Delaware. Democratic Representative-elect Sarah McBride.",
      "Welcome to FACE THE NATION.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Thank you for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting given how polarized, how angry and divided this country is that people choose to serve and to run. You told my colleague, Scott MacFarlane, that it was your personal experience as a caregiver for your husband during his bout with terminal cancer that inspired you to run. Do you expect that health care policy will be the focus of your work here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I certainly am glad to be back here in Delaware after two weeks of orientation and to have the privilege of serving the state that I love in Congress.",
      "I ran to bring down costs facing workers, retirees, and their families. That means bringing down the cost of health care, but also housing and childcare and everyday expenses like gas and groceries.",
      "I did run for office after my experience as a caregiver to my husband, Andy, during his battle with cancer. And throughout that experience, while Andy ultimately lost his life, we both knew how lucky we were. We knew how lucky Andy was to have health insurance that would allow him to get care that would hopefully save his life. And we both knew how lucky we were to have flexibility with our employers that allowed Andy to focus on the full- time job of getting care and me to focus on the full-time job of being there by his side to care for him, to love him, to marry him, and to walk him to his passing.",
      "And I ran for office because I do not believe that in the wealthiest, most developed nation on earth, that that time and that ability to get care should be a matter of luck. I believe it should be the law of the land. And it's why during my time in the Delaware general assembly I passed paid family and medical leave and secured the largest investment in our state's Medicaid program. And I want to do that work in Congress on health care, but also on housing and childcare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Paid leave is something that Mr. Trump has - has paid lip service to. We'll see in the new Congress if it comes up.",
      "We see in our CBS polling that 86 percent of voters feel congressional Democrats should find common ground with Mr. Trump and Republicans.",
      "Do you feel you can?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Well, I said throughout this campaign that I will work with anyone who's willing to work with me to help Delawareans, to lower cost facing my constituents. There are opportunities for us to find common ground. But it's also clear that this administration, as it begins to fill its appointments with Project 2025 authors, that a lot of the policies that this president will pursue will likely hurt my constituents and raise prices.",
      "And so, where I need to fight back, I will. But where I can find common ground, I will certainly seek it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: That's when I've done during my time in the general assembly where nearly every bill I passed, passed with bipartisan support.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you mentioned, you were here for orientation. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson was asking about you coming to work and some objections by a female South Carolina Republican representative regarding what bathroom you'd be able to use.",
      "Here's what the speaker said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): A man is a man, and a woman is a woman. And a man cannot become a woman. That said, I also believe - that's what scripture teaches, what I just said. But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe are you are being treated with dignity by your colleagues?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: I didn't run for the United States House of Representatives to talk about what bathroom I use. I didn't run to talk about myself. I ran to deliver for Delawareans. And while Republicans in Congress seem focused on bathrooms and trans people and specifically me, I'm focused on rolling up my sleeves, diving into the details, setting up my office, and beginning the hard work of delivering for Delawareans on the issues that I know keep them up at night.",
      "And I look forward to working with any colleague who's ready to work and ready to be serious about the issues that matter because, at the end of the day, how I'm being treated does not matter. What matters is how the American people are being treated, and whether we're actually focused on the issues that matter to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of your fellow congressional Democrats, including Tom Suozzi and Seth Moulton, have also recently spoken about their feelings, looking back at the last election, and said Democrats should be more open about saying whether they object to transgender athletes playing in girls' sports. Those were the specific examples they brought up.",
      "How would you respond to your soon-to-be Democratic colleagues on those? Do you understand why some parents, for example, feel uncomfortable or frustrated?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: Look, I think this country is still entering into a conversation about who trans people are, the full diversity of the community. And I've had conversations with colleagues in the Democratic caucus already that span diversity of thought about how the party should engage on a whole host of issues.",
      "But I think we are all united that every single American deserves equal rights, I think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean spirited but really an attempt to misdirect. Because every single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract. It is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time - every single time we hear them say the word trans, look at what they're doing with their right hand. Look at what they're doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors while privatizing Social Security and Medicare. Look what they're doing undermining workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT SARAH MCBRIDE: And here's also what we have to be clear about, because I think the last week has been a prime example of this. Every bit of time and energy that is used to divert the attention of the federal government to go after trans people is time and energy that is not focused on addressing the cost of living for our constituents. And we have clear that there is a real cost for the American worker every time they focus on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman-elect, I'm sure we'll be seeing you here in Washington.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "Chuck Woolery was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
    "story": [
      "Chuck Woolery, the affable, smooth-talking game show host of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" \"Love Connection\" and \"Scrabble\" who later became a right-wing podcaster, skewering liberals and accusing the government of lying about COVID-19, has died. He was 83.",
      "Mark Young, Woolery's podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present. \"Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,\" Young wrote.",
      "Woolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.",
      "In 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV's \"Love Connection,\" for which he coined the phrase, \"We'll be back in two minutes and two seconds,\" a two-fingered signature dubbed the \"2 and 2.\" In 1984, he hosted TV's \"Scrabble,\" simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.",
      "\"Love Connection,\" which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.",
      "A couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest's choice, \"Love Connection\" would offer to pay for a second date.",
      "Woolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. \"She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, 'I remember wagon trains.' The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.\"",
      "Other career highlights included hosting the shows \"Lingo,\" \"Greed\" and \"The Chuck Woolery Show,\" as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of \"The Dating Game\" from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV's \"Melrose Place.\"",
      "Woolery became the subject of the Game Show Network's first attempt at a reality show, \"Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,\" which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.",
      "Woolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.",
      "\"Wheel of Fortune\" started life as \"Shopper's Bazaar,\" incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\" singing \"Delta Dawn,\" Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.",
      "\"I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,\" Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. \"After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, 'Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn't care what you have to say \u2014 that's the guy I want to be.'\"",
      "NBC initially passed, but they retooled it as \"Wheel of Fortune\" and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on \"Hollywood Squares.\" Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.",
      "\"Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and 'Wheel' did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that 'Jeopardy!' achieved in its heyday,\" Griffin said in \"Merv: Making the Good Life Last,\" an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.",
      "Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.",
      "The Avant-Garde, which toured in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit \"Naturally Stoned,\" with Woolery singing, \"When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I'm naturally stoned.\"",
      "After The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single \"I've Been Wrong\" in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, \"Forgive My Heart\" and \"Love Me, Love Me.\"",
      "Woolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette's 1971 album \"We Sure Can Love Each Other,\" Woolery wrote \"The Joys of Being a Woman\" with lyrics including \"See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.\"",
      "After his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn't revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.",
      "He teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast \"Blunt Force Truth\" and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don't need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.",
      "\"President Obama's popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,\" he said.",
      "Woolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as \"Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.\"",
      "During the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump's chances for reelection to the presidency.",
      "\"The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it's all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I'm sick of it,\" Woolery wrote in July 2020.",
      "Trump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.",
      "Just days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19. \"To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,\" Woolery posted before his account was deleted.",
      "Woolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 \"a hoax\" or said \"it's not real,\" just that \"we've been lied to.\" Woolery also said it was \"an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it's important enough to do that.\"",
      "In addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.",

The brand's crispy onion product does contain wheat, and that allergen is noted on the label.",
      "No illnesses tied to the packaging mistake have been reported, according to the announcement from Sugar Foods. However, the company is still recalling the tortilla strips as a precaution.

The agency praised as \"incredible\" the efforts made by hundreds of people to help save the foundering pod.",

      "Vilnius, Lithuania \u2014 A DHL cargo plane crashed early Monday near the airport in Lithuania's capital, killing one person, authorities said as they searched for clues to what caused the tragedy. Lithuanian officials, who in the past weeks have been investigating incendiary devices allegedly sent on Western-bound cargo planes, stopped short of linking the crash with that investigation.",

It said he was last seen in Dubai. The UAE has a burgeoning Jewish community, with synagogues and businesses catering to kosher diners.",

      "Lebanon's Health Ministry said the death toll in the country's capital could rise as emergency responders dig through the rubble looking for survivors. DNA tests are being used to identify the victims, it said, adding that 66 people were wounded.",
      "The pre-dawn strikes, which destroyed an eight-story building and left a crater in the ground, were the fourth in Beirut in less than a week. Hezbollah legislator Amin Shiri said no Hezbollah officials were inside. The attack stripped the facades from some nearby buildings and crumpled cars.",
      "\"The area is residential, with closely packed buildings and narrow streets, making the situation challenging,\" said Walid Al-Hashash, a first responder with the Lebanese Civil Defense.",
      "Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded more than 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

On the Israeli side, about 90 soldiers and nearly 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles in northern Israel and in fighting in Lebanon.",
      "Israel's military did not issue a warning for residents prior to the strikes in central Beirut and did not comment on the casualties. It warned residents Saturday in parts of Beirut's southern suburbs that they were residing near Hezbollah facilities, which the army would target in the near future. The warning, posted on X, told people to evacuate at least 500 meters away.",
      "The army said that over the past day it had conducted intelligence-based strikes on Hezbollah targets in Dahiyeh, in Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. It said it hit several command centers and weapons storage facilities.",
      "Also Saturday, a drone strike killed two people and injured three in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency. Mohammed Bikai, spokesperson for the Fatah Palestinian faction in the Tyre area, said those killed were Palestinian refugees from nearby al-Rashidieh camp who were out fishing.",

      "Two Western diplomatic officials on Saturday described disputed points between Israel and Lebanon in cease-fire negotiations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks.",
      "The current proposal calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the southern border south of the Litani River. Thousands more Lebanese army troops would patrol the border area with U.N. peacekeepers, and an international committee would monitor the deal's implementation.",
      "The officials said Israel wanted more guarantees that Hezbollah's weapons would be removed from the border area. Israeli officials have said they would not agree to a deal that did not explicitly grant them freedom to strike in Lebanon if they believe Hezbollah is violating it.",

    "story": [
      "United Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity's fight against climate change, aimed at helping developing nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations.",
      "The $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming and pay for the damage caused by climate change's extreme weather. It's not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it's three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future.",
      "But it was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and some developing nations were livid about being ignored.",
      "COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough and the world's rich nations for being too stingy.",
      "However, Chandni Raina, a representative for India's COP 29 delegation, slammed the deal.",
      "\"We are disappointed in the outcome which clearly brings out the unwillingness of the developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,\" said Raina, according to Reuters.",
      "She called it \"nothing more than an optical illusion,\" saying it \"will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres   also indicated in a social media post disappointment in the outcome, saying that he \"had hoped for a more ambitious outcome, on both finance and mitigation, to meet the great challenge we face.\"",
      "He said the agreement is a \"base on which to build. It must be honored in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash.\"",
      "In a statement, President Biden called the deal a \"historic outcome,\" saying it \"will help mobilize the level of finance \u2013 from all sources \u2013 that developing countries need to accelerate the transition to clean, sustainable economies, while opening up new markets for American-made electric vehicles, batteries, and other products.\"",
      "He added that \"in the years ahead, we are confident that the United States will continue this work...While some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that's underway in America and around the world, nobody can reverse it \u2014 nobody.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will, for a second time, exit the\u00a0Paris Agreement, which was signed in in 2016 and seeks to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius and carbon emissions keep rising.  The U.S. formally\u00a0withdrew\u00a0during Trump's first term, but then\u00a0rejoined under Mr. Biden.",
      "Meanwhile, a long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke.",
      "\"I'm disappointed. It's definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,\" said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words \"at least\" before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line.",
      "\"Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,\" he said.",
      "The final package pushed through \"does not speak or reflect or inspire confidence,\" India's Raina said.",
      "\"We absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,\" Raina said. \"We are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.\"",
      "Speaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. And the Alliance of Small Island States' Cedric Schuster said he had more hope \"that the process would protect the interests of the most vulnerable\" but nevertheless expressed tempered support for the deal.",
      "There were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it.",
      "Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister, called the agreement \"a huge relief.\"",
      "\"It was not certain. This was tough,\" he said. \"Because it's a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.\"",
      "U.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an \"insurance policy for humanity,\" adding that like insurance, \"it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\"",
      "The deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It's part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.",
      "Countries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks \u2014 rich countries didn't think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources \u2014 but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with.",
      "\"The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,\" said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. \"This deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries' transitions.\"",
      "And even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit.",

      "The security force said it was \"coordinating with law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and defend against any and all threats to the president and the first family.\"",
      "Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the May 2022 elections and both won with landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity.",
      "The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to China's aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body.",
      "Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters.",
      "Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women's prison.",
      "In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks.",
      "When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old lawyer suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. \"Don't worry about my security because I've talked with somebody. I said 'if I'm killed, you'll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,'\" the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president.",
      "\"I've given my order, 'If I die, don't stop until you've killed them.' And he said, 'yes,'\" the vice president said.",
      "Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine.",
      "Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan \"with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority.\"",
      "\"We call for calm and resolve,\" Brawner said. \"We reiterate our need to stand together against those who will try to break our bonds as Filipinos.\"",
      "The vice president is the daughter of Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drugs crackdown when he was a city mayor and later as president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity.",
      "The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements. He told a public Philippine Senate inquiry last month that he had maintained a \"death squad\" of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of southern Davao city.",

    "story": [
      "Russia launched a volley of missiles toward the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro early Thursday morning, including a new type of ballistic missile that has North Atlantic Treaty Organization members on edge.",
      "The powerful next-level, multiple-warhead battlefield weapon, which has been analyzed by the Pentagon, has prompted NATO to hold an emergency summit on Tuesday. Among the cruise missiles intercepted in the assault was what the Defense Department has identified as a variant of the RS-26, an \"experimental\" intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), a reconfigured Russian intercontinental ballistic missile, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The missile aimed at Dnipro in central Ukraine focused on one area, carrying six warheads about 750 miles from the launch location, in retaliation for Ukraine's attack earlier in the week on a military facility in Russia. Ukraine is bracing for more volleys.",
      "While publicly, U.S. officials say Russia likely possesses only a handful of these experimental missiles, sources say these ballistic missiles pose a unique threat. They're capable of reaching 3,000 miles, and carrying a multiple-payload system. These systems are designed to carry and launch multiple warheads and to release them at different speeds and different directions, potentially over an area of more than 1,000 miles. They're also capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Heightening U.S. and NATO concerns further, it's the first time such a system has been used, and much still remains unknown about their utilization.",
      "\"What if he decides to target Lviv next,\" a U.S. official said, referencing a city in Western Ukraine near the border with Poland.",
      "The systems' capabilities challenge even the most advanced of Ukraine's air defense systems, as the war-weary nation tries to defend itself from Russia more than 2.5 years after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.",
      "Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Russian officials warned the U.S. of the launch through nuclear risk reduction channels. That helped ensure that it wasn't misidentified as an intercontinental ballistic missile and therefore a possible nuclear threat.",
      "While Russia already has sufficient weapons in its arsenal to strike NATO partners, Poland is particularly unnerved by these new developments. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there is a \"serious and real\" threat of global war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a \"clear and severe escalation\" by Russia. Zelenskyy accused Putin of using Ukraine as a \"testing ground.\"",

    "story": [
      "A woman who claimed mixed martial arts fighter\u00a0Conor McGregor\u00a0\"brutally raped and battered\" her in a Dublin hotel penthouse was awarded nearly $257,000 on Friday by a civil court jury in Ireland.",
      "The woman said the Dec. 9, 2018, assault after a night of partying left her heavily bruised and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "McGregor shook his head as the jury of eight women and four men returned the verdict after deliberating for about six hours in the High Court in Dublin. He was mobbed by cameras as he left court but did not comment.",
      "In a statement shared on X after the ruling, McGregor said he would be appealing the decision.",
      "\"The judge's instruction and the modest award given was for assault, not for aggravated or exemplary damages. I am disappointed that the jury did not hear all the evidence that the DPP reviewed,\" he wrote. \"I am with my family now, focused on my future. Thank you to all my support worldwide.\"",
      "McGregor testified that he never forced her to do anything and that the woman had fabricated her allegations after the two had consensual sex.",
      "Hand's lawyer said she never pretended to be a saint and had gone out looking for a good time that ended up turning into a nightmare.",
      "Attorney John Gordon said McGregor was angry about a fight he had lost in Las Vegas two months earlier and took it out on his client.",
      "\"He's not a man, he's a coward,\" Gordon told jurors. \"A devious coward and you should treat him for what he is.\"",

      "\"He let me go and I remember saying I was sorry, as I felt that I did something wrong and I wanted to reassure him that I wouldn't tell anyone so he wouldn't hurt me again,\" she said.",
      "She said she then let him do what he wanted and he had sex with her.",
      "Police investigated the woman's complaint, but prosecutors declined to bring charges, saying there was insufficient evidence and a conviction was unlikely.",
      "McGregor said the two had sex that was athletic and vigorous, but not rough. He said \"she never said 'no' or stopped\" and testified that everything she said was a lie.",
      "\"It is a full-blown lie among many lies,\" he said when asked about the chokehold allegation. \"How anyone could believe that me, as a prideful person, would highlight my shortcomings.\"",
      "McGregor's lawyer told jurors they had to set aside their animus toward the fighter.",
      "\"You may have an active dislike of him, some of you may even loathe him \u2013 there is no point pretending that the situation might be otherwise,\" attorney Remy Farrell said. \"I'm not asking you to invite him to Sunday brunch.\"",
      "The defense said the woman never told investigators McGregor threatened her life. They also showed surveillance video in court that they said appeared to show the woman kiss McGregor's arm and hug him after they left the hotel room. Farrell said she looked \"happy, happy, happy.\"",
      "McGregor said that when he was first questioned by police, he read them a prepared statement. On the advice of his lawyer, he refused to answer more than 100 follow-ups.",
      "McGregor has faced previous sexual assault allegations in the United States. In October 2023, the State Attorney's Office of Miami said it\u00a0would not pursue criminal charges\u00a0against McGregor after a woman accused him of attempting to force her to perform oral sex on him after an NBA finals game between Miami Heat and the Denver Nuggets.",

    "summary": "Daisy's mission is two-fold: To waste scammers' time so they can't speak to real people and to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant.",
    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "story": [
      "Draguignan, France \u2014 A court in southeast France on Friday sentenced to 20 years in jail a man who for years raped his teenage daughter and offered her up to strangers for sex. The case echoed the ongoing high-profile trial that has shocked the nation in which 51 men are accused of raping Gisele Pelicot, drugged by her husband so he could invite strangers to their home to abuse her.",
      "The 38-year-old father was convicted by the court in the southeast Var region of forcing sexual acts on his daughter from the age of 13. Prosecutor Estelle Bois described how the father exercised total control over the young girl, his adoptive daughter. He also brought her to other men, many of them much older, who he contacted through online classified ads.",
      "The father claimed to the other men that he and his daughter were both consenting adults living out a sexual fantasy. But he was convicted and sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison, in line with the demands of the prosecutors.",
      "Some of the defendants in the Pelicot case have claimed that they were given that same impression by the victim's then-husband, Dominique Pelicot.",
      "Also like Dominique Pelicot, the father in Friday's case directed, participated in and filmed the sex acts involving his daughter, who was blindfolded during the encounters.",
      "He admitted to the accusations, but claimed in court that he had a loving relationship with the young girl and had responded to her initiating sexual contact.",
      "\"This is not about love, but about power and domination. He doesn't love (his daughter), he loves having total control over her, her belonging to him, her obeying him,\" prosecutor Bois said.",
      "She also asked judges to jail for 16 years a second defendant, the only one of the other men to have abused the girl who could be identified.",
      "As in the Pelicot case, the second defendant \u2014 a man his 60s with six children \u2014 was identified thanks to the photo and video documentation by the father of the abuse, this time via geolocation data.",
      "The second defendant told the court that he had been taken in by the father's claim that the girl was consenting in three of his four meetings with them.",
      "In the fourth, \"things went badly. Rather than acting like a responsible man, he followed through on his own pleasure and closed his eyes\" to the abuse, his lawyer Christophe Mairet said.",
      "Now aged 18, the girl was accompanied in court by a golden retriever trained to comfort victims of abuse. She had, like Gisele Pelicot, declined the option of the trial being held behind closed doors.",
      "It was the teenager, then aged 15, who put a stop to her own abuse in 2021 by fleeing after her father's violence and humiliation escalated. She ran from their home in Cavalaire-sur-mer, south of glitzy resort town Saint-Tropez, before being brought to police by a holidaymaker.",
      "Her father bombarded her phone with calls and texts throughout her escape.",
      "Closing arguments have been given in the Pelicot case this week, with a verdict and sentencing of her husband and the dozens of co-defendants expected in December.",

      "Rep. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, is among a crowded list of contenders vying to replace Vice President-elect JD Vance when he formally resigns from the U.S. Senate.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Carey, a former coal lobbyist and combat veteran who won Ohio\u2019s 15th congressional district for the third time, touted his experience working with President-elect Trump in the private sector. Carey argued that whomever Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine chooses to replace Vance will need to be ready on \"day one\" to help implement the new administration\u2019s agenda. Vance has yet to formally resign.",
      "With three endorsements from Trump under his belt, Carey said the president-elect \"needs somebody in the Senate that will make sure that we get his agenda through.\"",
      "\"I think that's the most important thing, because I want the president to be successful. I think the American people want the president to be successful,\" Carey told Fox News Digital. \"And I think that's what we need from a senator from the state of Ohio. And so I'd be honored to help him move his agenda forward in the U.S. Senate.\"",
      "\"I think you need to have somebody that's able to start on Day One, hit the ground running as a U.S. senator,\" Carey, who serves on the House Ways and Means Committee and Committee on House Administration, said. \"You don't want to have somebody coming in from the great state of Ohio who has to be on the job\u00a0training. And so we've had a track record of success here in the, you know, in the 15th Congressional District. I can easily parlay that into the Senate.\"",

      "Through his work on the House Committee on Administration, Carey said he helped secure bipartisan support for and ultimately President Biden\u2019s signature on the bill that launched the Congressional Election Observer program. That program deploys congressional poll watchers to hotly contested House races.",
      "Carey also said the next senator has to be cognizant of the diverse nature of the state.",
      "\"I've spent a lifetime in Ohio. Born and raised in Ohio. But I think the senator has to understand we are a unique state,\" Carey said. \"There is a reason why Columbus, Ohio, is the test market for any product as it relates to food services, because we are a microcosm of the United States, and that is really Ohio.\"",
      "Similarly, Carey said that his district, which has an approximately 22% minority population and stretches from urban Columbus west across suburban areas and smaller towns and rural farmland, \"is really a microcosm of the state of Ohio.\" Carey said he outperformed Republican Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno in his district by over 18,000 votes.",
      "Moreno, a Trump-backed Cleveland businessman, garnered 50.18% of the vote, defeating incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown in a significant flip earlier this month. Carey, meanwhile, secured re-election in the House, receiving 56.52% of the vote.",
      "\"In an R-5 district, we won by 13 points. So, you know, I think I have a track record. And I also think, you know, if people look at my voting record and the things that I have done, I brought back over $60 million in three years. I mean, I've only been in office for three years,\" Carey said. \"I was in the private sector before that. So I'm not a career politician. But the opportunity to serve the state that I love, you know, I grew up in Cincinnati and Sabina and served in the military up at Camp Perry. My family's from Cleveland and spent my career in Appalachia. So there's nobody that knows the state any better than me. An opportunity to serve all the people of Ohio would be the honor of my life.\"",

      "Over the past several months, Carey said he has also been working on a tax credit for Americans \"who simply just can\u2019t afford IVF.\"",
      "\"If somebody wants to have a child, we should do everything possible to give them the opportunity to have a child,\" Carey told Fox News Digital. \"So, again, both very, I think, bipartisan ideas that the president has pushed forward.

      "Besides Carey, other members in Ohio\u2019s congressional delegation vying to replace Vance include Reps. Jim Jordan, David Joyce and Warren Davidson. But choosing a member of the House would temper the GOP\u2019s already slim majority in the lower chamber, and DeWine could weigh how House vacancies take months to fill under Ohio\u2019s election protocols.",
      "The vast number of GOP candidates who competed in Ohio primaries in 2022 and 2024 makes for an even wider field of potential replacements for Vance.",

I mean, there's nobody that loves Ohio more than, I'd say more than me, as would be Mike DeWine.\u2026 And I think he wants to get somebody in office that loves the state just as much as he does.

      "A Stanford University \"misinformation expert\" has been accused of using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft testimony later used by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in a politically-charged case.",
      "Jeff Hancock, a professor of communications and founder of the vaunted school's Social Media Lab, provided an expert declaration in a case involving a satirical conservative YouTuber named Christopher Kohls. The court case is about Minnesota's recent ban on political\u00a0deepfakes, which the plaintiffs argue is an attack on free speech.",
      "Hancock's testimony was submitted to the court by Ellison, who is arguing in favor of the law. Hancock is \"well-known for his research on how people use deception with technology, from sending texts and emails to detecting fake online reviews,\" according to Stanford's website.",

      "\"[The] Declaration of Prof. Jeff Hancock cites a study that does not exist,\" lawyers argued in a recent 36-page memo. \"No article by the title exists.\"",
      "The \"study\" was called \"The Influence of Deepfake Videos on Political Attitudes and Behavior\" and was purportedly published in the Journal of Information Technology & Politics. The Nov. 16 filing notes that the journal is authentic, but had never published a study by that name.",
      "\"The publication exists, but the cited pages belong to unrelated articles,\" the lawyers argued. \"Likely, the study was a \u2018hallucination\u2019 generated by an AI large language model like ChatGPT.\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs do not know how this hallucination wound up in Hancock\u2019s declaration, but it calls the entire document into question, especially when much of the commentary contains no methodology or analytic logic whatsoever.\"",
      "The document also calls out Ellison, arguing that \"the conclusions that Ellison most relies on have no methodology behind them and consist entirely of expert say-so.\"",
      "\"Hancock could have cited a real study similar to the proposition in paragraph 21,\" the memo states. \"But the existence of a fictional citation Hancock (or his assistants) didn\u2019t even bother to click calls into question the quality and veracity of the entire declaration.\"",

      "The memorandum also doubles down on the claim that the citation is bogus, noting the multiple searches lawyers went through to try to locate the study.",
      "\"The title of the alleged article, and even a snippet of it, does not appear on anywhere on the internet as indexed by Google and Bing, the most commonly-used search engines,\" the document states. \"Searching Google Scholar, a specialized search engine for academic papers and patent publications, reveals no articles matching the description of the citation authored by \u2018Hwang\u2019 [the purported author] that includes the term \u2018deepfake.\u2019\"",
      "\"Perhaps this was simply a copy-paste error? It\u2019s not,\" the filing later flatly states. \"The article doesn\u2019t exist.\"",
      "The attorneys concluded that, if the declaration were partially fabricated, it is entirely unreliable and should be dismissed from court consideration.",
      "\"The declaration of Prof. Hancock should be excluded in its entirety because at least some of it is based on fabricated material likely generated by an AI model, which calls into question its conclusory assertions,\" the document concluded. \"The court may inquire into the source of the fabrication and additional action may be warranted.\"",

There\u2019s usually a link that leads to a fake Apple site, asking you to enter your username, password and additional personal details to reactivate your account.

      "3. Don\u2019t click on suspicious links: If the email asks you to click a link, don\u2019t do it right away. Hover over the link to see the actual URL. If it doesn\u2019t look like an official Apple website (or any site you trust), don\u2019t click it.",

      "6. Invest in data removal services: Scammers often use personal information that\u2019s readily available online to craft more convincing phishing attempts. By investing in data removal services, you can reduce the amount of personal data that\u2019s exposed on the web, making it harder for scammers to target you effectively.",

      "Free email services may not charge you money directly, but they often monetize your data in other ways. These providers typically engage in data collection and analysis, which can lead to targeted advertising and tracking of your email activity.",

      "Secure email providers offer several advantages over their free counterparts. One of the most significant benefits is enhanced encryption, which provides better protection for your communications. Unlike many free services that collect and sell user data to third parties, privacy-focused providers do not engage in such practices.

First, you should research and choose a provider that meets your needs by comparing features, pricing and user reviews. Once you have made your selection, create an account with your chosen service; many offer a free tier to get started. After setting up your account, it is essential to enable encryption by following the provider's instructions.",
      "Next, you can import any existing emails from your old account using the provider's import tool. Informing your contacts about your new email address is also important to ensure seamless communication moving forward. To further enhance security, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your new account to add an extra layer of protection.

      "While paying for an email service might seem unnecessary at first glance, it is an investment in your privacy and security that can yield significant benefits over time. By choosing a subscription-based model, you support the development of privacy-focused technologies that prioritize user interests over advertising revenue.

Second, from all the companies that received your consumer profile, the ones listed (or not) in the fine print of the privacy policy. Third, from all the retailers you bought from in the past, including that one-time purchase of a kettlebell set three years ago (that you\u2019d rather forget).",
      "But that\u2019s not all; Black Friday is a fiesta for hackers, too, and the perfect time for social engineering attacks! The urgency and excitement of Black Friday deals encourage you to let your guard down. You\u2019re likelier to click on links or open attachments without checking the source. And less likely to notice that a phishing email pretending to be sent by a big retailer has sneaked into your inbox. Your data is being collected, shared and sold as you read this article.",

Depending on where you live, these options may simply not be available to you.",
      "An easier solution is to use a\u00a0disposable email address whenever you open an account for the sole purpose of making a purchase. Once you receive your order confirmation, you can disable it so that no further communication is sent your way. You can also use privacy-focused tools or browsers that block tracking cookies and prevent companies from collecting your data.",

      "8 tips to safeguard your email after Black Friday",
      "As the dust settles from the shopping rush, it's crucial to be proactive; here are eight essential tips to help you protect your email and personal information from the surge of spam and scams that often follow.",
      "1. Create alias email addresses.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address. An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of best secure and private email services here.",
      "2. Use a\u00a0password manager to consistently use complex passwords that you can change frequently.",
      "3. Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from emails unless you are sure they are from a trusted source. Scammers or hackers can easily change the name of the sender to make it look like it came from a legitimate organization such as Amazon or an individual.\u00a0 But if you click the email header, you will see the sender's actual email address. By pretending to be a reputable organization, the crooks send urgent messages to make you click on links, reply or provide personal information in an attempt to fix a problem or claim a reward. If you click on a malicious link, then a scammer may be able to access your email and other personal data.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software on all your devices:\u00a0The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Malicious links are often disguised as legitimate ones, but they can download malware onto your device without your knowledge. Malware is a type of software that can damage your device, steal your personal information, or give hackers access to your data. Hackers can then use your data for various purposes, such as\u00a0identity theft, fraud or blackmail. This is why it is important to have antivirus software that can detect and remove malware before it causes any harm.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Go directly to the official site where you have any accounts, such as your financial institution, to check if any changes or charges were made instead of clicking links in the email you received or responding to the email. This way, you can avoid falling for phishing scams and keep your account secure.",
      "6. Limit the number of accounts or profiles you create with your personal email account.",
      "7.\u00a0Regularly scrub your personal information on the internet. You don\u2019t want spammers to take your email and add it to their lists, do you? That would result in annoying and potentially dangerous messages flooding your inbox. To prevent that, you need to make sure your personal information is not exposed on the internet. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0See my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "If a scammer gets hold of your email address, they can use it to access your other accounts, send phishing emails to trick you into revealing your passwords or personal details, or even impersonate you to commit fraud or other crimes. This is why it is important to protect your email address from falling into the wrong hands and to act quickly if you suspect that it has been compromised. Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1. If you can regain control of your accounts,\u00a0change your passwords and inform the account provider.",
      "2. Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use\u00a0identity theft protection services to manage your personal information on and offline. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using identity theft protections services is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4.\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5. You may wish to get the professional advice of a lawyer\u00a0before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft, and if being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing.",
      "6.\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7. Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Navigating the world of online shopping during Black Friday can be a thrilling yet daunting experience. While the discounts are enticing, they often come with hidden costs \u2014 namely, your personal data. As you prepare your shopping list, consider utilizing tools to safeguard your information.

    "summary": "Porch pirates are on the prowl this holiday season. Tech guru Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson has a number of tips to prevent holiday package thefts.",
    "story": [
      "The busy holiday shopping season is just around the corner and most of us will be targeted by an AI scam.",
      "As the holiday season approaches, the excitement of gift-giving can quickly turn into anxiety over package theft. With porch pirates on the prowl, your carefully delivered gifts can vanish right from your doorstep. In 2023 alone, a staggering\u00a0119 million packages were reported stolen, meaning one in every 180 deliveries disappeared into thin air.",
      "Cities like Seattle, Memphis and San Diego have become hot spots for these unfortunate heists.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself racing home to rescue a package, asking neighbors to keep an eye out or, worst of all, falling victim to these sneaky thieves, you\u2019re not alone. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019ve got some tips that could save you from the holiday headache of package theft. Let\u2019s dive in.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "Alleged porch pirate taking packages from property (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 1: Get security cameras",
      "First things first, consider installing security cameras around your home. Having a good camera system can really make a difference when it comes to deterring those sneaky thieves. Depending upon how well your police department responds to porch pirate package theft, position your\u00a0video doorbell to capture the face of the pirate and your package deliveries. A Video Doorbell can push notifications to get a phone alert whenever anyone or anything approaches your door, even if they don't ring the doorbell.",
      "Also, you might want to consider adding a couple of nearly invisible\u00a0wireless cameras on tree limbs near the street at your house. We did it in hopes of being able to record a license plate if ever needed for police. I can set them to send a notification when the camera detects a person or car.",
      "When you\u2019re shopping for cameras, look for high-resolution video so you can see everything clearly, even at night, with night vision capabilities. Motion detection is a must. It\u2019ll alert you if someone gets too close to your front door. Plus, two-way audio lets you talk to anyone at your door, whether it\u2019s a delivery person or someone who shouldn\u2019t be there. And don\u2019t forget about cloud storage. This way, you can easily access footage whenever you need it. Check out my top picks for the\u00a0six best outdoor security cameras.",
      "Pro tip: If your camera has the feature, set your video camera to notify you when it identifies packages within view.",
      "GET MORE OF MY TOP PICKS TO AMP UP YOUR HOME SECURITY",
      "Image of a doorbell camera (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 2: Use tracking apps",
      "Next up, make sure you're using tracking apps for your deliveries. Most shipping companies offer tracking services that let you follow your package from the moment it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at your home.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "If you sign up for\u00a0USPS Informed Delivery, you\u2019ll get digital previews of what\u2019s coming to your mailbox, which is super handy. You can set up email or text alerts for delivery updates so you\u2019re always in the loop about when your packages are arriving. Some retailers even send you photos once your package has been delivered, giving you extra reassurance that it made it safely.",
      "A woman using a tracking app on her iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY LAPTOP DEALS",
      "Tip 3: Make sure someone is home",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about timing. It\u2019s important to have someone around to receive packages as soon as they arrive. This can be tricky since many deliveries happen during work hours. If you can swing it, try working from home on days when important packages are expected. If that\u2019s not possible, coordinate with friends, family members or roommates so someone is always there to grab\u00a0the delivery right away.",

      "A woman receiving packages at home (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS",
      "Tip 4: Coordinate with your neighbors",
      "Don\u2019t underestimate the power of community. Teaming up with your neighbors can be a game-changer in preventing package theft. Sign up for neighborhood porch pirate alerts from popular local networks like\u00a0Neighbors and\u00a0Nextdoor apps. This is where people often post when they've had a package stolen and sometimes upload videos or images of the suspected porch pirates. Plus, making an agreement with trusted neighbors to watch each other\u2019s packages can really enhance security; there's strength in numbers.",
      "A person picking up packages for their neighbor (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST BLACK FRIDAY PRINTER DEALS",
      "Tip 5: Have the package delivered somewhere else",
      "If home delivery feels too risky, consider alternative delivery options that offer more security. Many people choose to have their packages sent to their workplace if allowed; this way, they\u2019re less likely to be stolen than sitting on a porch all day. Retailers often provide secure pickup points where you can collect your packages at your convenience. Renting a P.O. Box or using services that hold packages for pickup at local shipping facilities are also great options for those valuable items.",
      "KURT\u2019S UNBEATABLE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS",
      "A woman receiving packages at her workplace (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 6: Request a signature confirmation",
      "Another way to prevent package theft is to request a signature confirmation for your deliveries. This means that the delivery person will not leave the package at your door unless someone signs for it. You can request a signature confirmation from most delivery services, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. This option may cost extra, but it can give you peace of mind that your package will not be stolen.",
      "Tip 7: Send to remote pick-up locations",
      "Did you know that most delivery services now offer remote pick-up locations? These can be secure lockers, post offices or retail counters. Amazon has hundreds of Amazon Lockers and pick-up counters across the country, which are free for Prime members.\u00a0See how\u00a0far away the nearest Amazon Locker is located from your home.",
      "When you're checking out, just click on\u00a0Change next to your shipping address, then select\u00a0Find a pickup location near you to see your options. Once your package is delivered, you'll get a notification or email with a code to retrieve it from the locker or pick-up point. Some items can even be returned at these locations.",
      "A person picking up a package from a locker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 8: Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery",
      "We added a strong deadbolt to the door leading into the house from the garage before signing up. Now, when we are not home, an Amazon delivery can be placed securely inside our garage using the free service called Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery. The addition of a\u00a0smart garage controller is the first step. Once you've signed up for Amazon Key In-Garage Delivery, pick Key Delivery when checking out on Amazon to have your packages securely put in the garage. I really like that you can block access to your garage any time you want. The driver never needs your garage code, and access only works for their one-time delivery.",
      "A delivery being made using Amazon Key-In-Garage Delivery (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 9: Provide a delivery box",
      "Another great option is to invest in a\u00a0delivery box that allows packages to be securely dropped off and stored discreetly. Just remember that you'll need to inform delivery personnel about using the box and how it works.",
      "Package being placed in a delivery box (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip 10: Sign up for delivery notifications",
      "You can get an alert each time a package arrives at your doorstep.\u00a0Both FedEx and UPS will send a text when you've just received a delivery.\u00a0Amazon will also send you a shipment text letting you know a package has just been delivered.",
      "To set up\u00a0Amazon delivery notifications, follow these quick steps.",

      "ROBOT DOG IS MAKING WAVES WITH ITS UNDERWATER SKILLS",
      "Why fire ants are such a big deal",
      "Red imported fire ants may be small, but their impact is anything but trivial. Native to central South America, these aggressive ants have spread across the United States, Australia and parts of Asia, causing extensive environmental and economic damage. In the U.S. alone, they are responsible for an estimated $6 billion in losses each year due to reduced crop yields and damage to farm equipment.",

      "How the CyberDog works its magic",
      "Published in the\u00a0SCI journal Pest Management Science, the study showcases how the CyberDog robot, equipped with an AI model, can efficiently automate the identification and control of red imported fire ants, a notoriously destructive global pest. The research team trained the CyberDog using a comprehensive dataset of over 1,100 images of fire ant nests, resulting in an impressive detection accuracy rate of over 90%.",
      "The robot is programmed to poke suspected nests with its paw; when it does so, active nests release their workers in a defensive frenzy, confirming the presence of fire ants. This unique method allows researchers to distinguish between active mounds and those that may be abandoned or occupied by other species.",

      "More than just ant control",
      "Beyond its practical applications in pest management, the CyberDog also serves an educational purpose. Zheng Yan, one of the researchers involved in the project, emphasizes that sightings of robots tracking fire ant nests can captivate public interest and raise awareness about the dangers posed by invasive species. By engaging communities in this way, scientists hope to foster greater understanding and proactive measures against these ecological threats.",

Additionally, acquiring more advanced models can be costly. However, as technology continues to evolve and production costs decrease, it's likely that robotic solutions like this will become more accessible for widespread use in pest control.",

      "With Apple rolling out the latest iOS 18.1 update, privacy has become an even hotter topic. The update introduces advanced AI capabilities through Apple Intelligence and Siri, giving your device more autonomy in understanding and learning from your behaviors.",
      "While this sounds promising, it also means that your iPhone might be capturing and analyzing sensitive information, especially if you have certain financial or health-related apps on your device.",

      "Why privacy matters more than ever in iOS 18.1",
      "iOS 18.1 brings a slew of AI-powered features aimed at enhancing your experience with Siri and Apple Intelligence, but it\u2019s worth questioning: How much does your iPhone really need to know about you? If you're like most people, privacy is a top priority, especially when it comes to sensitive data such as banking information, health details and your location.",
      "When Apple Intelligence is enabled, it starts \"learning\" from your interactions with certain apps, creating a digital profile that can theoretically tailor your experience. This is a double-edged sword; while personalization might sound appealing, it\u2019s crucial to consider what data Apple\u2019s AI is learning and why you might want to limit its reach.",

This customization is entirely up to you, but it\u2019s essential to know where these toggles are and what each does.",
      "Why you should revisit these settings regularly",
      "One thing about privacy settings is that they can change with each software update. As Apple introduces more features, some apps may automatically gain access to Apple Intelligence.

      "The arrival of iOS 18.1 is exciting, especially with the enhanced AI features, but it\u2019s crucial to stay vigilant about your privacy. Banking, health and location apps contain some of your most sensitive data, and allowing Apple Intelligence to learn from them might open up unintended risks. By turning off \"Learn from this App\" in settings, you\u2019re taking a proactive step to control your personal information. Remember, gray is off, green is on, and when it comes to privacy, sometimes it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution.",

      "\"Immigration, legal immigration should be efficient and accessible and affordable for everyone,\" says Yasaman Soroori, the co-founder and CEO of Consulta, a new A.I.-powered platform offering high-tech solutions for those immigration issues.\u00a0 It\u2019s thought to be the first online platform dedicated specifically to helping legal immigrants navigate America\u2019s complicated immigration landscape.\u00a0 Their goal is simple;\u00a0 integrating tech with personalized support, hoping to bring order and affordability to a complex and costly process.",

While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",

Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",

Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",

      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored.

    "published": "Sun, 24 Nov 2024 12:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump allies and other Republicans have provided a preview of what could happen to protests, protestors, and aligned groups once the new administration begins",
    "story": [
      "Congressional Republicans and former Trump appointees have spent the last year building out their response to the movement protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and now that Donald Trump is returning to the White House they warn that protest leaders, activists and those who help them raise money could face an onslaught of federal investigations and possible indictments.",
      "An NBC News review of congressional hearings and letters, along with lawsuits filed by organizations led by former Trump officials, provides a preview of which federal laws a second Trump administration could use when pursuing investigations and potential prosecutions.",
      "Judging from what has been pushed thus far, there are several legal measures most likely to be used once Trump returns to Washington. One would be deporting foreign college students in the U.S. on a visa after they\u2019re found to have openly advocated for Hamas or another U.S.-designated terror group, or after they participated in an unauthorized campus protest and were suspended, expelled or jailed.",
      "Another measure would be to pursue federal prosecutions of demonstrators who block synagogue entrances or disrupt Jewish speakers at events. A third approach is to charge protest leaders and nonprofits that aid in fundraising for protest groups with failing to register with the U.S. Justice Department as an \u201cagent of a foreign principal.\u201d And a fourth avenue is to open investigations into protest leaders who are in direct contact with U.S.-designated terror groups while advocating on their behalf.",
      "The multifaceted law enforcement approach is a marked departure from the Biden administration\u2019s response to the protest movement. Some of the nation\u2019s leading civil rights groups told NBC News that they are gearing up for a flood of legal battles to protect the protesters.",
      "\u201cTrying to predict what Trump will do is a fool\u2019s errand. We have to be prepared for the most extreme version of what he\u2019s threatened,\u201d said Ben Wizner, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s\u00a0Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. \u201cWe have to take him both literally and seriously.\u201d",
      "\u2018A new sheriff in town\u2019",
      "Biden administration officials have told NBC News that prosecuting speech-related crimes related to the anti-war protests is not a high priority for the current Justice Department, nor is seeking out student protesters on foreign visas a top concern for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump will enforce the law,\u201d said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, in an email to NBC News. Ernst recently asked the FBI to open an investigation into a pro-Hamas student group at Columbia University called Columbia University Apartheid Divest. A member had threatened \u201cZionists\u201d on social media, which the organization had initially distanced itself from after a strong public outcry but later supported in an Instagram post. CUAD also has handed out pro-Hamas flyers that circulated around campus featuring masked men holding weapons.",
      "\u201cThere is a new sheriff in town,\u201d Ernst said. The FBI has yet to respond to Ernst\u2019s request, her office said. An FBI spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. A Columbia University spokesperson said CUAD is not a recognized organization by the school and the flyers were under investigation. Members of CUAD declined to comment.",
      "Reed Rubinstein, who held high-ranking positions in both the Justice Department and the U.S. Education Department in the first Trump administration, is now a senior vice president at America First Legal, a public policy law firm in Washington, D.C., founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. (Miller is expected to return to the White House as a deputy chief of staff for policy.)",
      "Under Rubinstein, America First Legal has in the past year filed four lawsuits that provide a glimpse into how the Trump administration could differ from its predecessor. America First Legal alleges in the suits that the State Department, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education have protected pro-Hamas extremists.",
      "In court papers and in letters to several federal oversight officials, America First Legal has also said it believes the Justice Department should have forced several leaders of pro-Palestinian groups to report themselves under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, known as FARA, which requires individuals acting as \u201can agent of a foreign principal\u201d to register themselves with the Justice Department.",
      "It has also accused the Department of Education of not following Title VI regulations,\u00a0which prohibits schools that accept federal funding from allowing on-campus discrimination based on race, shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics including being Jewish.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between lawful speech and unlawful conduct,\u201d Rubinstein told NBC News.\u00a0\u201cLaw enforcement has an obligation to act.\u201d",
      "Although the lawsuits haven\u2019t progressed in court, they provide a possible road map for how Trump-minded prosecutors could respond to the protest movement.",
      "So far, only the Education Department has responded to the allegations, court papers show, and said the agency doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to respond to the claims that policies aren\u2019t being enforced. The Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople at the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education all said they can\u2019t comment on pending litigation.",
      "Rubinstein in an interview brought up an additional law he expects a second Trump administration could enforce. Known as the FACE Act, the law prohibits people from using force, threats or intimidation while blocking entrances of places of worship. Earlier this month, protesters with SJP Chicago gathered at the Chicago Loop Synagogue to demonstrate against an Arab Israeli speaker who had served in the Israeli military. Videos posted to social media showed demonstrators blocking the synagogue\u2019s entrance, banging on the windows and getting inside.",
      "\u201cYou do not have the right to deny somebody the ability to congregate in a church or synagogue,\u201d Rubinstein said. \u201cWe would like to see the Department of Justice do its job.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the FBI\u2019s Chicago office said its policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. The Chicago Police Department said it arrested two protesters and charged them with trespassing and one with property damage, both misdemeanor charges.",
      "SJP Chicago did not respond to a request for comment. But in an Instagram post, it said protesters were not being anti-Jewish. \u201cZionist have scrambled to throw together a narrative that these acts were anti-semetic and fueled by hate (what\u2019s new).\u201d",
      "An expected flood of legal battles",
      "Some of the nation\u2019s leading free speech and civil rights groups say they are gearing up to fight a new Trump administration and any attempts to go after protesters or their funders. Since 9/11, organizations including the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), along with the ACLU, the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Knight First Amendment Institute have represented Muslim Americans and pro-Palestinian activists in cases involving free speech, surveillance or abuse.",
      "Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR\u2019s deputy executive director, argued that the Biden administration failed to enforce FARA against leaders of pro-Israel groups. Mitchell said both Trump and President Joe Biden single out pro-Palestinian activists with either a lack of enforcement or with too much enforcement.",
      "\u201cJust as Americans who peacefully marched, protested and lobbied against segregation, the Vietnam War and South African apartheid were not deterred when government agencies spied upon, smeared, arrested and brutalized them,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cthe college students, human rights activists and everyday Americans peacefully opposing the Gaza genocide have not been deterred by such government abuses and, God willing, will not be deterred by such abuses in the future.\u201d",
      "Both CCR and the ACLU told NBC News that their concerns go beyond what the administration could do to crack down on just the protests. They pointed to the possibility that a Republican-led Congress could pass a bill currently under consideration that would strip away the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that a Trump appointed treasury secretary designates as providing material support to\u00a0\u201cterrorist supporting organizations.\u201d CCR also said it worries a second Trump administration could wrongly level accusations of failing to register as foreign agents against protest leaders and nonprofits that aid protest groups with collecting donations. CCR is also watching whether a Trump Justice Department will charge certain activists accused of supporting Hamas and other U.S.-designated terror organizations with violating a U.S. anti-terror law that prohibits advocating for terror groups while in coordination with them.",
      "\u201cWe are prepared for the Trump administration coming in and changing the game, particularly around the question, \u2018Where does speech fit into this?\u2019\u201d said Vince Warren, CCR\u2019s executive director.\u00a0 \u201cTo the extent that the Biden administration drew a line between speech and actionable conduct, we don\u2019t think that the Trump administration will do that at all.\u201d",
      "CCR is also concerned about the plans laid out in Project Esther, an initiative backed by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025.\u00a0Project Esther urges law enforcement to use a plethora of federal and state laws to dismantle what it terms the \u201cglobal Hamas Support Network\u201d using racketeering laws \u2014 used to break up the mafia \u2014 along with anti-terrorism and anti-hate speech laws.",
      "\u201cThey will throw any type of spaghetti up against the wall,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The Knight Institute said although it expects the new Trump administration to aggressively police speech, it is prepared to fight back. Earlier this month, Knight successfully rebuffed the Biden Treasury Department, which had blocked a New York based nonprofit from organizing an overseas conference with Hezbollah members, arguing it can\u2019t work with people sanctioned for ties to terrorism groups. The agency reversed course and settled the case earlier this month after Knight argued that an academic exchange of ideas could not violate anti-terror laws.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the First Amendment protects, it\u2019s the right of Americans to criticize their own government\u2019s policies,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute\u2019s executive director.",
      "The ACLU\u2019s Wizner struck a similar note, saying: \u201cThe courts have made clear that the First Amendment protects all manner of controversial advocacy, including advocacy of violence, so long as the speaker isn\u2019t actively inciting imminent harm,\u201d Wizner said.",
      "Impact on college campuses",
      "Kenneth Marcus, who ran the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights during the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, now leads the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, one of the leading civil rights organizations focused on Jewish students. Over the past year, the center has sued a growing list of universities arguing officials failed to stop what it sees as widespread antisemitism on campus.",
      "Marcus said he has met with Department of Education officials requesting an expansion of civil rights enforcement to protect Jewish students on campuses. The Department of Education didn\u2019t respond to questions regarding Marcus\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cWe know that President Trump has repeatedly expressed concern about the campus situation,\u201d Marcus said.",
      "During the presidential campaign, one of the 20 promises in the preamble to the Republican Party platform was to \u201cdeport pro-Hamas radicals and make our college campuses safe and patriotic again.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported in August that the Biden administration said it was not targeting visa revocations for foreign students who may have engaged in speech-related offenses or participated in unauthorized campus protests\u00a0and had not terminated any university or college student visas due to protest activity related to the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to Washington could lead to possible attempts to revoke student visas for foreign students who openly support Hamas or other U.S.-designated terror organizations, Marcus said. Marcus also anticipates more intervention from the Justice Department when Jewish students say they are being targeted on campus.",
      "At a campaign stop in September, Trump said that at the start of his second presidency, he would inform universities that if they allow violence and threats against Jewish students, they \u201cwill be held accountable for violations of the civil rights law.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy administration will move swiftly to restore safety for Jewish students and Jewish people on American streets,\u201d Trump said."

    "published": "Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:53:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty suggested that Americans don't care about traditional FBI background checks for President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks as Democrats call for deeper vetting of executive branch nominees.",
    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty suggested Sunday that Americans don't care about traditional FBI background checks for President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks as Democrats call for deeper vetting of executive branch nominees.",
      "Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Sunday that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d who conducts background checks for presidential nominees when asked the FBI's role in conducting a background check on former Fox News host Pete Hegseth.",
      "Asked about the common practice of conducting FBI background checks for presidential cabinet nominees, Hagerty told host Jon Karl that Trump getting to work on the \u201cmandate\u201d the American people voted on is more important to Americans than an FBI-conducted background check.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the American public cares who does the background checks. What the American public cares about is to see the mandate that they voted in delivered upon,\u201d Hagerty said during an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to get to work again. Making our military stronger is absolutely critical. And I think we\u2019re we\u2019re looking at a chance to do this,\u201d Hagerty added.",
      "Hegseth, who Trump picked to lead the Department of Defense, was accused of sexual assault in 2017. An unidentified woman told police at the time that Hegseth took her phone and prevented her from leaving a hotel room before he sexually assaulted her after a Republican women's convention in California, according to a police report released earlier this month.",
      "Hegseth has denied wrongdoing and was not charged.\u00a0His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the report\u2019s description of surveillance footage at the hotel where the unnamed woman met Hegseth and police interviews with others who were at the hotel prove his innocence.",
      "An FBI background check, usually used during confirmation proceedings, would likely look into allegations such as that one.",
      "Trump\u2019s team has not said why he hasn\u2019t submitted his nominees for background checks, and a request for comment from his transition team was not immediately returned.",
      "But Democratic lawmakers have argued that background checks for potential nominees are critical tools when vetting potential high-level appointees.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" that she can't evaluate Cabinet-level nominees without FBI background checks, adding that the practice is used for securing even lower-ranking government jobs.",
      "\u201cWe require these background checks of DEA agents \u2014 drug enforcement agents. We require them of first-time prosecutors for the federal government. Why wouldn\u2019t we get these background checks for the most important jobs in the United States government?\u201d Klobuchar said, pointing out that Republicans would be deciding whether Trump's picks are qualified for the job, regardless of a background check.",
      "Many Republican lawmakers have agreed, rejecting the notion of doing away with FBI background checks.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said the FBI can get access to information that private firms cannot and would be able to conduct more thorough checks.",
      "\u201cIf you wanted to supplement it with a private firm, I\u2019d say OK. But the FBI does have access to information that probably a private firm wouldn\u2019t have, even a really good savvy one,\u201d he told The Hill.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also said that the FBI should conduct the checks, while Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said that if the FBI did not vet the nominees and the job were outsourced to a private firm, lawmakers \u201cwould want to know the validity of those individuals doing the background checks.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said it\u2019s \u201croutine\u201d for the FBI to conduct the checks.",
      "\u201cI get there is distrust by some of different agencies, and the FBI is not immune from that, but I do think it is vitally important, particularly from a national security perspective, that you have a level of vetting that is thorough,\u201d Murkowski told The Hill.",
      "Last week, Reps. Don Beyer, D-Va., and Ted Lieu, D-Calif., released a press statement saying they had introduced the Security Clearance Review Act to codify the FBI's role in conducting background checks for Executive Office of the President employees such as Cabinet officials \"amid\u00a0reports\u00a0that President-elect Donald Trump and his advisors intend to bypass traditional background checks to grant security clearances to political appointees.\"",
      "While the bill would necessitate background checks for all high-level administration positions, some of Trump's picks in particular have been cause for concern among Democratic senators. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., told Dana Bash on CNN Sunday that Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was \u201ccompromised,\u201d saying that \"Russian-controlled media called her a Russian asset.\"",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic lawmaker from Hawaii, has caused a stir after Trump picked her for the top intelligence job. Gabbard failed to condemn Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, following a pattern of siding with the country and other authoritarian regimes. Gabbard made a trip in 2017 to meet with Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad, even though the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with the country.",
      "Gabbard has rejected accusations that she is a mouthpiece for Russia or the Syrian regime. Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.",
      "\u201cThe US intelligence community has identified her as having troubling relationships with America\u2019s foes, and so my worry is that she couldn\u2019t pass a background check,\u201d Duckworth told Bash.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told Bash later on Sunday that Duckworth\u2019s comments were \u201cdangerous\u201d and politically motivated.",
      "\u201cTammy is absolutely dead wrong on this, and she should retract those words. It\u2019s the most dangerous thing she could say is that a United States lieutenant colonel and the United States Army is compromised and is an asset of Russia,\u201d Mullin said, adding it was \u201cactually sad to hear her say that.\u201d",
      "On an appearance Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet The Press,\" Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. said calling Gabbard a \"Russian asset\" is a \"slur.\"",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really interesting that anybody that has a different political view now is being cast as a Russian asset. ... I think it\u2019s insulting. It\u2019s a slur, quite frankly. You know, there\u2019s no evidence that she\u2019s an asset of another country,\u201d Schmitt said, also stating he was confident all of Trump's picks will be properly vetted prior to undergoing the Senate confirmation process.",
      "Responding to Schmitt's interview, Senator-elect Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said he wouldn't describe Gabbard as \u201clikely a Russian asset\u201d but maintained that she has \"certainly echoed talking points for the Kremlin.\"",
      "\"The problem is, if our foreign allies don\u2019t trust the head of our intelligence agencies, they\u2019ll stop sharing information with us. And that makes our country less safe. So, I have profound concerns about her,\" he told moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "Schiff also argued that the president-elect\u2019s \"lack of background checks for his nominees is flawed,\" pointing to former Rep. Matt Gaetz's selection to be attorney general and hasty withdrawal amid sexual misconduct allegations as exposing a \"flaw in the process.\"",
      "\"That vetting process, having the FBI review potential nominees, is not only to protect the public interests, it\u2019s to protect the president-elect\u2019s interests, to make sure that he\u2019s not embarrassed by nominating someone like Matt Gaetz. So, I think it shows a flaw in the process that he even got nominated,\" he said.",
      "One additional Trump Cabinet selection, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been tapped to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Kennedy responded to the allegation against him\u00a0by saying: \u201cI said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\u201d He\u00a0apologized to his accuser over text messages this year, NBC News reported."

      "His remarks come as special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting two cases against Trump \u2014 one related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and one related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office in 2021 \u2014 plans to wind down the cases against Trump and resign before he takes office.",
      "In the week after Trump was projected to win the election, Smith asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to hit pause on the 2020 election case. Chutkan granted the motion shortly after the request was filed.",
      "Schmitt framed his call to fire anyone who worked on these cases as a form of \u201caccountability,\u201d telling moderator Kristen Welker, \u201c[The cases] all fell apart under the weight of the law. And so I do think there needs to be accountability. I think that getting it back to crime-fighting is important, but there has to be accountability for these kinds of abuses.\u201d",

      "Trump has often said he would pardon the more than 1,000 supporters who have been charged with crimes related to storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "On the campaign trail, he also indicated that he would use the Justice Department to target his political opponents, including Smith.",

      "And after a September campaign rally, Trump wrote in a post, \u201cWHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences. Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Before this NFL season began, a major concern surrounding the Philadelphia Eagles was how their new running back would play behind a new-look offensive line.",
      "That question has been definitively answered.",
      "Saquon Barkley added to his candidacy for the NFL\u2019s most valuable player and the Eagles won their seventh consecutive game on NBC\u2019s \"Sunday Night Football\" by dominating in the run game, yet again, and sprinting past the Los Angeles Rams 37-20.",
      "Just one season after being cast off from the New York Giants, Barkley ran behind an overpowering offensive line for a career-high 255 yards \u2014 the first time in his career he has rushed for more than 200 yards \u2014 including touchdown runs of 70 and 72 yards in which defenders could barely lay a hand on the back, let alone stop him.",
      "It was the most individual rushing yards in a single game since 2009, and pushed Barkley to 1,392 yards on the season, a new career-high set in only 11 games.",
      "Already the NFL\u2019s leader in yards from scrimmage, Barkley pushed his lead in that category by also catching four passes for 47 yards. With the win, the Eagles improve to 9-2, including 5-1 on the road, to extend their NFC East division advantage over the Washington Commanders.",
      "\"We just got to keep building,\" Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts said postgame on NBC. \"Momentum is the fakest thing out there because it could end or begin at any moment. We just want to continue to build, learn from our mistakes and play good ball.\"",
      "The Rams drop to 5-6. They had won four of their last five games, but the loss won\u2019t derail their playoff aspirations, not in an NFC West division that remains tightly knotted together entering the season\u2019s home stretch.",
      "But the story was Barkley and the legitimate Super Bowl potential he has created for a team that, just one year ago, was enduring a late-season collapse. This season, the Eagles have gotten stronger as the weeks have gone on.",
      "Even with\u00a0the hole left by the offseason retirement of center Jason Kelce, a likely future Hall of Famer, the Eagles entered Sunday owning the NFL\u2019s top rushing offense, averaging 181.3 yards per game.",
      "Against the Rams, Philadelphia rushed for 314. The run-pass combination kept the Rams\u2019 defense off-balance, as Philadelphia converted nine of its 15 third-down opportunities, compared to 0-of-8 for Los Angeles.",
      "\"He's a hell of a player,\" Hurts said of Barkley. \"He's the best at what he does.\"",
      "SNF blog: Look back at how the game unfolded",
      "The consistency of their run game has allowed Philadelphia to ground down teams in second halves, and that trend also continued as Philadelphia scored 24 points after halftime to the Rams\u2019 13.",
      "The Eagles are now only the second team in NFL history, and the first since 1949, to rush for at least 150 yards and multiple rushing touchdowns in six consecutive games.",
      "\"I got a fresh start,\" Barkley said postgame. \"I'm around a great group of guys. The whole organization for me, top to bottom, has welcomed me in with open arms. I'm having fun. I'm ready to go out there and perform at a high level and get ready for next week.\"",

    "story": [
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez\u2019s efforts to reduce their life-without-parole prison terms remain in limbo after the ouster earlier this month of Los Angeles County\u2019s top prosecutor, who recommended a new sentence that could clear the way for the brothers\u2019 release.",
      "But those efforts will inch forward Monday when the siblings appear for a status conference to determine if a Dec. 11 resentencing hearing should remain on the schedule, a lawyer for the brothers told NBC News.",
      "Defense attorney Mark Geragos told NBC Los Angeles that Erik and Lyle will appear remotely from the San Diego prison where they are  incarcerated.",
      "The brothers have served 35 years for the shotgun murders of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, at the family\u2019s Beverly Hills home on Aug. 20, 1989.",
      "Last month, outgoing Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said he supported reducing their sentences to 50 years to life \u2014 a reduction that would make them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "A judge is responsible for rejecting or supporting Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s decision.",
      "The recommendation came after a specialized unit within Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s office that aims to implement reform-minded resentencing laws reviewed the brothers\u2019 case.",
      "While their crimes were brutal and premeditated, Gasc\u00f3n has acknowledged, the brothers have been model prisoners. They\u2019ve paid their debt to society, he said, and no longer pose a public safety risk.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s decision was applauded by many members of the Mendendez family, who have advocated for the men\u2019s release and pointed to the horrific abuse the siblings said they suffered at the hands of their father.",
      "The brothers\u2019 supporters have described the killings as a desperate act of self-defense \u2014 an allegation that echoes the defense laid out by the brothers\u2019 legal team during their two murder trials in the 1990s.",
      "Prosecutors said the allegations of abuse were a false attempt at covering up what authorities described as the brothers\u2019 true motive \u2014 ensuring access to their family\u2019s multimillion-dollar estate.",
      "The first trial ended with hung juries after they could not deliver a unanimous verdict. The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder during their second trial.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has acknowledged that his recommendation remains polarizing within his own office, with some prosecutors believing the abuse allegations and others arguing the brothers should remain behind bars for the rest of their lives.",
      "Incoming district attorney Nathan Hochman, who is set to take office Dec. 2, has said he needs to review the facts, law and evidence in the case before he makes a decision. Multiple sources have said there was a \u201cgood chance\u201d he would seek to delay the Dec. 11 hearing.",
      "The brothers have also sought their freedom through a request for clemency from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a petition that seeks to challenge their convictions.",
      "That petition, filed in May 2023, includes what Geragos has described as evidence that Jos\u00e9 Menendez was abusing Erik Menendez in the months before the siblings killed their parents.",
      "Both efforts remain ongoing."

      "\"After 11 months the waiting has finally ended and unfortunately our target was not Amelia's Electra 10E,\" it said in the Nov. 6 post, referring to her twin engine Lockheed 10-E Electra.",
      "The company, based in Charleston, South Carolina, did not immediately respond to a request for more information about its conclusion.",
      "The sonar image of what appeared to be a cross-shaped object not unlike an aircraft sparked excitement when the company announced in January that Earhart\u2019s plane was \u201cbelieved to be found.\u201d",

      "Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, were expected to refuel on Howland in July 1937, but never arrived. Both were declared dead two years later, despite failure to locate their remains or a crash site.",
      "Deep Sea Vision and its CEO, Tony Romeo, did some navigational math and came up with a possible area for a crash site, sending marine archeologists and its HUGIN 6000 submersible vehicle to scan the depths of the ocean 1,600 meters at a time, the company said in a statement early this year.",
      "The company said in January that members of the expedition debated whether to release the sonar image, with Deep Sea Vision asserting that the discovery wasn\u2019t one for the record books without another expedition with more exacting data or an outside organization confirming what Deep Sea Vision believed it had found.",
      "It's November conclusion that it found a natural undersea formation came with more humility \u2014 and humor. Deep Sea Vision's Instagram page also featured a post this month of a branded T-shirt with the sonar image that states: \"We find rocks.\"",
      "Romeo told CNN that the company hopes to return to the area to continue the search for Earhart's last location.",
      "\"In some ways, I\u2019m even more excited now about it now,\" he told the network."

On average, families spent anywhere from $6,552 to as much as $15,600 on full-day care per child in 2022, the latest year with available data.",
      "That upper range is a few hundred dollars more than that year\u2019s median annual rent, the agency noted. While incomes also range widely throughout the country, households typically funnel between about 9% and 16% of their annual income on day care per child.",

According to its website, members of the CBC currently represent 120 million people in the U.S. and 41% of Black Americans.",

Niccara Campbell Wallace, executive director of the Rolling Sea Action Fund, said this makes the CBC\u2019s growth from 60 members in the 118th Congress all the more noteworthy.",

      "After announcing he would not return to Congress, Matt Gaetz appears to be trying out a new career option: creating personalized videos for his fans on Cameo.",
      "Gaetz, a former Florida representative, joined the platform Friday, a day after he withdrew his name from consideration to serve as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general amid sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "There, he\u2019s been doling out paid holiday wishes, marriage congratulations and career pep talks. As of Sunday night, Gaetz is charging a minimum of $550 per video, which so far have averaged about a minute and a half in length.",
      "\u201cI served in Congress,\u201d his Cameo page reads, alluding to his recent resignation and subsequent announcement that he does not plan to retake his House seat. \u201cTrump nominated me to be US Attorney General (that didn\u2019t work out). Once I fired the House Speaker.\u201d",
      "The speaker he \"fired\" hints at his feud with Kevin McCarthy, whom he played a pivotal role in ousting last year when Gaetz forced a House vote that led to McCarthy's removal from office.",
      "A representative for Gaetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Gaetz announced Thursday his decision to take himself out of the running for attorney general, writing on X, \u201cWhile the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\u201d",
      "His potential appointment was overshadowed by several allegations of sexual misconduct, including allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old at a party in 2017. He was also investigated by the Justice Department \u2014 which he would have led had he been confirmed \u2014 related to allegations of sex trafficking and sex with a minor. Gaetz has vehemently denied allegations of sexual misconduct, and the investigation ended with no charges against him.",
      "Gaetz\u2019s resignation last week also effectively ended a House Ethics Committee investigation into the allegations against him, which had been ongoing intermittently since 2021.",
      "From Capitol Hill to Cameo",
      "Cameo, the celebrity video message app, which launched in 2017, allows users to purchase custom shoutouts from famous figures who join the app. Fans on Cameo commonly request these videos, priced by the celebrities themselves, for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries and graduations.",
      "Despite facing some financial trouble in recent years, Cameo has remained a fixture for some public figures seeking an extra source of income. It\u2019s become a notorious marketplace for fan-requested videos from pop culture\u2019s most dramatic and villainized personalities, which often go viral when posted to social media platforms like TikTok and X.",
      "In one video, Gaetz, a Republican, filmed himself congratulating a recipient for making partner at their law firm while acknowledging their political differences.",
      "\u201cLook, I know your politics and mine may not align specifically, but you know, our career trajectories might not be either. I mean, here you are making partner, and my legal career took a little bit of a different turn this last week,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cBut you know what? Work hard, get paid a lot of money, do a lot of great things as a practitioner and counselor at law, and you know, you never know. You could be an attorney general nominee, too.\u201d",
      "Other videos feature Gaetz thanking his recipients for \u201cbacking President Trump and all of our efforts to save the country\u201d and being \u201cthere for MAGA.\u201d He also roasted one recipient for \u201cbetting on things like\u2026 Kamala Harris to be the President of the United States. You got to get better habits for that \u2014 bet on Trump.\u201d",
      "Gaetz is following in the footsteps of other embattled politicians such as former Rep. George Santos, who turned to the platform after he was ousted from the House late last year amid allegations of wire fraud and identity theft. Earlier this year, Santos made his drag queen persona available on the app as well. He has since pleaded guilty to a pair of felony fraud charges.",
      "Also on Cameo are Rod Blagojevich, the former Illinois governor who was removed from office and incarcerated on charges of public corruption, and Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who was\u00a0indicted on charges\u00a0related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia.",
      "Giuliani has pleaded not guilty to the charges in the Georgia election interference case. He was also found liable for\u00a0defaming two Georgia election workers.",
      "Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former attorney who pleaded guilty to and served time in prison for federal crimes, is also active on the app. Other political figures on Cameo include former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Fox News commentator Tomi Lahren."

      "\u201cI think we are all united that attempts to attack a vulnerable community are not only mean-spirited, but really an attempt to misdirect,\u201d McBride told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cEvery single time we hear the incoming administration or Republicans in Congress talk about any vulnerable group in this country, we have to be clear that it is an attempt to distract.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cIt is an attempt to distract from what they are actually doing. Every single time, every single time we hear them say the word \u2018trans,\u2019 look what they\u2019re doing with their right hand. Look at what they\u2019re doing to pick the pocket of American workers, to fleece seniors by privatizing Social Security and Medicare,\u201d McBride added.",
      "In a separate interview Sunday, she also characterized the ongoing Republican moves to restrict where she can use the bathroom on Capitol Hill \u201ca lot of noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the last two years, over the last two weeks, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of noise around me, but I\u2019ve remained focused,\u201d McBride told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Weekend.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t run for her seat, where she\u2019ll begin serving as a first-term congresswoman in January, to make waves.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t run to be a first. I didn\u2019t run to make history. I ran to serve this state that I love and to deliver for Delawareans,\u201d McBride said.",
      "Her comments come as Republicans have ramped up attacks against her in the last two weeks, with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., sponsoring a resolution that would prohibit House members and staff from \u201cusing single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.\u201d",
      "Shortly after introducing the resolution, Mace made clear that the measure was \u201cabsolutely\u201d targeting McBride.",
      "On Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., joined Mace, saying in a statement, \u201cAll single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings \u2014\u00a0such as\u00a0restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms \u2014 are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.\u201d",
      "He added that \u201ceach Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Mace doubled down on her anti-trans rhetoric, telling Fox News, \u201cSo many women now today feel more brave and have more courage because I\u2019ve been speaking out. They feel like they\u2019re going to be supported.\u201d",
      "In the wake of Mace and Johnson\u2019s statements, Democrats in both chambers of Congress have backed McBride, condemning Republicans for targeting her.",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., blasted Mace as \u201cdisgusting and wrong,\u201d telling CNN: \u201cWe have issues here in this country, and yet she\u2019s worried about one member of Congress using the bathroom. Number one, I think her position is disgusting and wrong, but I also think that we have a lot more to worry about than where somebody goes to pee.\u201d",
      "During Thursday\u2019s White House press briefing, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that President Joe Biden is \u201cvery proud of\u201d McBride and added: \u201cWhat [McBride] said is, \u2018I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families.\u2019 And we agree with her.\u201d",
      "And on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused House Republicans of \u201cbullying\u201d McBride.",
      "\u201cThis incoming small House Republican Conference majority is beginning to transition to the new Congress by bullying a member of Congress,\u201d Jeffries told reporters.",
      "He added: \u201cThis is what we\u2019re doing? This is the lesson that you\u2019ve drawn from the election in November? This is your priority, that you want to bully a member of Congress, as opposed to welcoming her to join this body so all of us can work together to get things done and deliver real results for the American people.\u201d"

      "Everything\u2019s still coming up Milhouse for\u00a0Pamela Hayden. The actress, who has voiced Bart\u2019s best friend on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d for 35 years,\u00a0is retiring after Sunday night\u2019s episode, \u201cTreehouse of Horror Presents: Simpsons Wicked This Way Comes.\u201d But Hayden said she has no regrets in parting ways with the long-running show.",
      "\u201cHow many actors can say they\u2019ve worked on a show for 35 years straight?\u201d Hayden told\u00a0Variety.\u00a0\u201cThat alone is amazing. But it was time for me to devote my time to other creative endeavors that I have, like filmmaking. It was a tough decision, but I feel like it was the right one.\u201d",
      "Given the long lead time that animation takes from concept to air, Hayden\u2019s exit has been in the works for a while. Hayden, whose voices also included school bully Jimbo Jones, Rod Flanders, Chief Wiggum\u2019s wife Sarah and Lisa\u2019s friend Janey Powell, said \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has been accommodating in preparing for her retirement, and the producers even offered to give her a going-away party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just not like anything I\u2019ve ever worked on,\u201d said Hayden, who has also voiced characters on \u201cHey Arnold,\u201d \u201cPinky and the Brain,\u201d \u201cThe New Batman Adventures\u201d and \u201cRecess.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime job on a once-in-a-lifetime show. But being an actor, I think you\u2019re kind of used to taking risks. That\u2019s the kind of person I am. I\u2019m not about playing things safe. And there were other things I wanted to do. I think you throw it against the wall and see what sticks.\u201d",
      "That includes Hayden\u2019s documentary \u201cJailhouse to Milhouse,\u201d which documents her tough upbringing. The film has hit the festival circuit and she said she hoped it would \u201cinspire people who have fallen through the cracks to still have hope. It\u2019s about my life, and there were a few really hanky years there when I was younger. When I speak to at-risk girls, I say, \u2018if I can do it, you can do it.\u2019 Because that\u2019s true. I\u2019m no different than them.\u201d",
      "Beyond \u201cJailhouse to Milhouse,\u201d Hayden said she has also co-written the book and lyrics to a musical she has been developing. \u201cI\u2019d like to get that up, but frankly, the way theater has been going since COVID, is not great,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been successful getting the show up in New York. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "Even as she retires, Hayden said she expects to hear from fans, who regularly share their favorite Milhouse moments and quotes. Besides \u201cEverything\u2019s coming up Milhouse,\u201d that includes Milhouse quoting Prince: \u201cThis is what it feels like when doves cry.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody has their own favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I liked about Milhouse is even though he gets kicked around, he always feels like tomorrow\u2019s going to be a better say. Whether it is or not. And I think that\u2019s great. It\u2019s a good analogy for life.\u201d",
      "Milhouse\u00a0first appeared with Bart before \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d even premiered, in a 1989 Butterfinger commercial. \u201cBart needed someone to talk to in the school cafeteria. We named him\u00a0Milhouse\u00a0because that was the most unfortunate name a kid could have,\u201d creator Matt Groening said in a statement. \u201cPamela gave us tons of laughs with\u00a0Milhouse, the hapless kid with the biggest nose in Springfield.\u00a0She made\u00a0Milhouse\u00a0hilarious and real, and we will miss her.\u201d",
      "Added exec producer\u00a0James L Brooks:\u00a0\u201cShe is a model for having a great spirit\u00a0for every cast she has been a part of. We will miss her.\u201d And said showrunner/executive producer\u00a0Matt Selman: \u201cPamela\u2019s talent and joy and love for her characters has added a magic to\u00a0\u2018The\u00a0Simpsons\u2019\u00a0that will never be forgotten. Everything\u2019s coming up Pamela!\u201d",
      "As Milhouse, Hayden marveled at what she\u2019s been asked to voice over the years, such as singing the French National Anthem as a six year old boy. And in person, the \u201cSimpsons\u201d stars and producers traveled to Europe together to do live shows in London and in Edinburgh, and perform at comedy festivals in Aspen and Montreal. And then there were all those iconic stars she got to voice opposite with over the years, like Meryl Streep.",
      "\u201cWhen the Rolling Stones were there, I guess Keith and Mick weren\u2019t talking then, and so we had to record them separately,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI think Keith had a drink in one hand and a cigarette. There really wasn\u2019t any place for him to hold the script or put it down, because you only have two paws, right?",
      "\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d producers plan to audition a new actor to pick up Milhouse and Hayden\u2019s other roles. (\u201cI know they won\u2019t kill them off because it\u2019s a comedy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill off a 10 year old character!\u201d) Her advice to those looking to audition? Make the characters their own, rather than imitating her.",
      "\u201cIt is a sticky wicket in the sense that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever good to just do an impression. It is a difficult task put your stamp on a character, but to still make it sound like the character that has already originated,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want them to bring their own gift to the party.\u201d",
      "As for what she\u2019ll miss most about playing Milhouse, Hayden stressed the relationships she built with her fellow stars and the producers (most of whom have been there for decades) on \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are such finely drawn characters,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll still have a special place in my heart for that blue haired boy. No matter what. But the show will go on.\u201d"

The sequel follows Mescal's character, Lucius, who becomes a gladiator after he is taken prisoner and forced to work into the Colosseum.",
      "While winning battles for Macrinus (Washington), a well-connected Roman businessman, Lucius learns his family's history and is inspired to help Rome return to its former glory.",
      "The film was released on Friday, Nov. 22, and has a total run time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. According to Variety, \"Gladiator II\" has a projected domestic opening weekend of $60 million and opened with a \"powerful\" debut of $87 million in the international box office arena, making it the biggest international R-rated opening weekend for Paramount Pictures.",
      "While the box office stats appear to be doing well for the sequel to the Oscar-winning film, on social media fans had mixed reactions.",
      "Some applauded the film, calling it \"excellent\" and \"soooo good.\"",
      "Others were a bit more dramatic with one writing, \u201cJust watched gladiator 2 and suddenly life is worth living again.\u201d",
      "Another shared they were in tears over the film.",
      "While some felt the new film was a great follow up to the first, others on X felt differently. Some noted that \"Gladiator II\" just couldn't compare to the first movie.",
      "\"If you love Gladiator 1, Don\u2019t watch Gladiator 2,\" a fan wrote.",
      "Another added their analysis: \"While Gladiator 2 is not bad at all, it suffers from a comparison to that masterpiece that Scott directed in 2000. The first Gladiator was pure Cinema from start to finish, where the fantastic performances and visuals were complimented by an heartfelt story and a glorious score.\"",
      "A third shared their thoughts, calling \"Gladiator\" a \"MASTERPIECE,\" but  \"Gladiator II\" a \"sword-and-sandals action flick you\u2019ll forget about next week.\"",
      "A few questioned the film's plot with one calling the film \"unnecessary\" with a \"forced script that didn\u2019t add to the story in any meaningful way.\"",
      "Another added that they hated the lazy \"plot points\" of the film.",
      "One even joked that the film's plot had nothing to with Lucius storyline, sharing a meme that read, \"Me; \u201cI\u2019m watching Gladiator 2 for the plot,\u201d before adding a shirtless photo of Paul Mescal next to a photo of Pedro Pascal with the headline, \"The plot;\"",
      "Though the social media reactions to \"Gladiator II\" varied online, there seemed to be an overwhelming consensus about one thing: Denzel Washington made it worth the watch.",
      "\"GLADIATOR II is okay. Mescal is fine, as is everyone else,\" one person tweeted before adding, \"The real star, as you\u2019ve probably heard, is Denzel Washington, delivering one of his most magnetic performances. His contagious, electrifying presence goes a long way in elevating a painfully by-the-numbers movie.\"",
      "Another person predicted that Washington would get an Oscar nod for his performance.",
      "\"Not going to lie I can\u2019t stop thinking of Denzel\u2019s performance in Gladiator 2. He has an Oscar with his name written on it,\" the person wrote in part.",
      "Others had similar sentiments about Washington's performance, with one even joking that the Oscar winner carried the entire film."

      "\u201cI begged my parents to go to the Gerswhin (Theatre, home of \u201cWicked\u201d). We couldn\u2019t afford tickets, but I was like, \u2018Can I at least go so I can press my face up against the glass?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe same day, we went two avenues over to Rockefeller Center to go do the NBC Studios tour. We picked the TODAY show, we went to Conan, and then we went to \u2018SNL.\u2019\u201d",

      "As for any notable reactions from his castmates?",
      "\u201cSarah Sherman was there, and she sobbed the entire movie. Just to watch her cry with joy and being emotional about things is my favorite thing. She\u2019s the emotional, validating force in my life,\u201d he says.",

      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Most surprising, shocking set moment was, I think just walking into Shiz (University) the first day. Like every single person was awestruck. Even the people who were on the crew who had worked on like every Marvel movie, all the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies and like, every other big blockbuster, was like, \u2018We\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u2019 So it just blew everyone\u2019s expectations out of the water.",
      "But then the most shocking single moment was \u2014 there's a giant sculpted face of Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard that I'm sure you know what I'm talking about in the movie. And Ari (Ariana Grande) and I were just walking around set one day, just like having a little walk about, and then we just popped up on it, and it really gave us a jump scare. But it\u2019s just because he\u2019s so striking and handsome, of course.",
      "That's Jeff Goldblum. I think it's the first time you ever see him in the movie. It's really amazing. It's quite \u2014 it leaves an impression.",
      "Yeah, it felt like a Sleep No More immersive theater experience. You just walked around and like, it felt so intimate. It felt we were at school, just in the quad, just walking around.",
      "Definitely. All of us were like, within these social dynamics of being at school. It felt very freshmen orientation-y because it was like, we're in a classroom together. Seating arrangement was very intentional. I think it accelerated familiarity with everybody.",
      "First person I met when I got to rehearsals was Ari. Yeah, it was really special. It was Ari, and then it was Bronwyn James, who plays Shenshen, my other half, my other extension.",
      "We would have wine nights after shoots, especially when we were shooting remotely out in the countryside. The Shiz campus was like, all the way outside of London. And so they put us up in this place where we would just like, have a little night cap. And it was just a really tasteful adult thing. And then we would all go to bed and show up to work the next morning. It just felt like an adult summer camp.",
      "I\u2019ve been obsessed with it. Cynthia (Erivo) and I have the same thing where we didn\u2019t see it until much later in our lives, but we knew the songs and the story, obviously... If you were in a drama club in the aughts, it was just the thing, like you lived and breathed it.",
      "I just remember going to the library and renting out the original Broadway cast recording and flipping through the booklet \u2014 remember those? And just seeing pictures of Idina (Menzel, the original Elphaba) and Kristin (Chenoweth, the original Glinda). I was like, something has changed within me. I was like, this is the best, this is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.",
      "Pfannee's vibe. There's a moment where Pfannee and Shenshen run up to Galinda when she gets off the boat at Shiz that you might see in an extended version of the film. But they are just there to rekindle this friendship with Galinda that they've had since they were kids.",
      "That's background, that's not totally necessary, but I think, what's really interesting about them as characters is that they see and they operate on status. They see Galinda, and they're like, she's someone that we can, like, glom onto.",
      "We talked about them early on and Jon (M. Chu) was like, \"I don't think these are the lackeys, or like the snickering best friends. I think there's something more to them.\" And we were like, \"Yeah, what is it?\" I think what we landed on was that they are kind of Galinda's publicists.",
      "Ari was very protective of Galinda not being the one to enact the bullying, she\u2019s good. And so it falls on these two characters to be the nefarious ones. We\u2019re the ones who give her the hat and are like, \u2018You know who should wear this? Elphaba.\u2019\u201d",
      "We're just protecting our client! Exactly.",

      "Glad \u2014\u00a0Gladwick. I like Gladwick.",
      "Gladwick's cute. It sounds like a candle you buy a target. Gladwick.",
      "Oh yeah, we're so excited. This is the perfect time of year to do a double feature. You've totally got nothing but time, hopefully.",
      "I think \u201cGladiator II\u201d is going to be slightly more intense, maybe more of an emotional drain, perhaps. It\u2019s going to be very, I think, quite violent.",
      "And I think our movie is a cute salve to put over that wound. Yeah, maybe watch \u201cWicked\u201d after \u201cGladiator.\u201d",
      "The rules of Ozian culture are: The train to the Emerald City is too small. That's rule of culture No. 7.",
      "Rule of Ozian culture No. 61 is animals know how to party better than humans do. That's why they're at the Ozdust.",
      "And rule of Ozian culture No. 4 is Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) is unfortunately a style icon, even though she's a villain.",
      "Look, everyone\u2019s like, \u2018This is the longest intermission ever.\u2019 It needs to be that because a lot of time passes between the acts.",
      "A lot happens right when we pick up. Galinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen are at her side still, but a lot is in motion. The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like, the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "The story is so flexible how it relates to our real world, but I think, it's going to be interesting to see it \u2014",
      "(Editor\u2019s note: Paul Mescal, star of \u201cGladiator II,\u201d stopped to say hello to Yang in the TODAY green room.)",
      "And a lot has shifted in the topography of things. But yeah it needs that, because if you go straight from \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d to what happens in Act 2, it just feels like too much of a lurch."

(For a bit of \u201cWicked\u201d history, both Menzel and Chenoweth were nominated for best performance by a leading actress in a musical at the 2004 Tonys, which Menzel won.)",

      "How does \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 begin?",
      "In the sequel, a now-adult Lucius is taken prisoner after Acacius takes siege over the city he was taken to as a child, years after Lucius\u2019 mother dispelled him from Rome over concerns for his safety once his father Maximus was killed in the first film.",
      "After being captured, Lucius and several other prisoners are sent into the Colosseum where they are forced to fend off a pack of feral baboons \u2014 or die.",
      "\u201cThat sequence is absolutely insane, almost unfathomable when you see it,\u201d Mescal said, according to the film\u2019s press notes. \u201cHe is taken prisoner and dragged into Rome. He has an intense anger towards everything Roman that will grow as the film progresses.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen he enters the arena for the first time, he sees Acacius, the\u00a0 general who led the siege of his city and was responsible for killing his wife. He sees him sitting there with his\u00a0own wife and he vows to himself to kill them or be killed,\u201d Mescal continues.",
      "Lucius soon realizes the heavy implication of that vow. Acacius' wife, played by Connie Nielsen, is his mother \u2014 and no one appears to remember his true identity.",
      "Lucius' performance against the baboons in the Colosseum catches the attention of Denzel Washington\u2019s character Macrinus, who teases Lucius with an opportunity at freedom and a chance to face Acacius.",
      "But before those things can happen, Macrinus, an astute Roman businessman with great wealth and connections across the empire, forces Lucius to become his gladiator in order to repay him and earn his freedom.",
      "Viewers soon find out that Macrinus has ulterior motives \u2014 including toppling the twin emperors Geta and Caracalla, played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, respectively.",
      "\u201cLucius is a natural-born leader and a great fighter, which makes him useful in many ways. But pure rage is not a tool; it\u2019s a disadvantage. Macrinus never wants to lose control. He doesn\u2019t want to be the emperor. He wants to control the emperor,\u201d Washington said, according to the press notes.",
      "\u201cAnd power is an addictive drug. Once you have it, you can\u2019t live without it. Once he had a taste for taking, he had to have more. He doesn\u2019t really care about anyone. He uses them. If people can\u2019t make him more powerful, he has no interest in them,\u201d he added.",
      "How does \u2018Gladiator II\u2019 end?",
      "An attempted coup led by Acacius marks the beginning of the end in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",

      "\u201cBecause he is leading the Roman army, you\u2019ll think he\u2019s a villain,\u201d Pascal said of his character in the film\u2019s press notes. \u201cBut Acacius loves Lucilla, a beloved character from the first movie. So, then he\u2019s a good guy. And the movie plays those tricks on us continually.\u201d",
      "Acacius attempts to take over the government from the twin emperors, but Macrinus learns of his plan through his connections throughout the empire and thwarts it.",
      "The general is then thrown into the Colosseum as punishment and ordered to fight Lucius in front of the emperors and scores of Roman citizens. Though Lucius has previously vowed to kill Acacius to avenge the killing of his wife, he ultimately decides not to kill him in the arena, which angers Geta and Caracalla.",
      "The emperors order for the guards to kill Acacius, and several soldiers shoot him to death with arrows sent flying from across the arena. The crowd hates the decision \u2014 hinting at another uprising.",
      "The death of Acacius destabilizes the emperors\u2019 reign, which Macrinus capitalizes on. He begins plotting to turn the twin brothers against each other, and focuses on Caracalla\u2019s insecurity as the weaker leader. He convinces him to kill his own brother, and during the murder, Macrinus even helps him cut off Geta\u2019s head.",
      "An obvious nod to his instability, Caracalla appoints his pet monkey as first consul, but appoints Macrinus as his second consul, giving the businessman sweeping authority over the empire.",
      "Meanwhile, Lucius hears that his mother is set to be executed for her role in the attempted coup and decides to finally accept his destiny as a leader in Rome.",
      "He sends a messenger (along with a ring belonging to his father given to him by Lucilla) to a group of Acacius\u2019 soldiers gathered outside of Rome. His plan? To rally his fellow gladiators to try to stop his mother\u2019s execution and use the Acacius' soldiers to take back the city.",
      "As Lucilla is brought out into the Colosseum\u00a0to be executed, the gladiators overpower the guards, but not before Macrinus manages to shoot Lucilla in the chest with an arrow. He then rides out of the Colosseum to gather his own army to fight against the Acacius\u2019 soldiers.",
      "Lucius chases him, and the pair face off in an epic battle on the outskirts of town with their two armies watching. Lucius wins the battle, cutting off Macrinus' arm and killing him in a river. He then gives an inspiring speech to the soldiers about rebuilding Rome, just as his father Maximus would have wanted.",
      "In the film's final scene, Lucius returns to the Colosseum and picks up some of the dirt, an obvious homage to the first film. A brief clip, which appears to be from the original film, then plays and shows a hand touching wheat in a field, a moment symbolic of one passing through to the afterlife.",
      "The screen then fades to black, leaving fans and viewers to wonder if there will be a third film in the \u201cGladiator\u201d universe."

      "But is \"Wicked\" \u2014 which follows the origin story of the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 also family-friendly?",
      "\"Wicked\" was rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested, and some material may not be suitable for young children.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the kid-friendliness of \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "Is 'Wicked' for kids?",
      "Yes, \"Wicked\" is for kids, director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com.",
      "Chu says two of his five children, age 7 and 5, have seen \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy 3-year-old did not see it yet, but I\u2019m going to bring her,\u201d he adds.",
      "\"Wicked\" is rated PG for \"some scary action, thematic material and brief suggestive material.\"",
      "For parents of young kids, Chu notes: Beware the flying monkeys.",
      "Toward the end of \"Wicked,\" viewers learn the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West's famous henchman, her flying monkeys. Instead of costumed actors like in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" uses computer-generated imagery for the monkeys (and all the other animals in the film, including a lion cub, bear and goat).",
      "Chu says the monkeys are \"definitely not as creepy\" as they were in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" However, a Washington Post review of the film argues the flying monkeys are more terrifying with CGI, warning parents, \"this is not a movie for very young children.\"",
      "As for thematic and brief suggestive material, the film does feature some romance. There's an onscreen kiss and an implied sexual encounter in one of the film's first scenes.",
      "What age is 'Wicked' appropriate for?",
      "Common Sense Media rates the film as appropriate for kids aged 10 and up, citing \"(light) jump-scares\" involving the flying monkeys, the Wizard of Oz's giant avatar head and the bullying Cynthia Erivo's character Elphaba experiences.",
      "The film is also long, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes in the theater, not including any previews.",
      "The original Broadway musical that the film is based on is recommended for children age 8 and up, and children under 5 years old are not admitted, according to the \"Wicked\" musical's website. The 1995 book that inspired the musical, Gregory Maguire's  \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch,\" is not for children and includes swearing, sex, violence and more mature themes.",
      "Chu overall describes his 2024 \u201cWicked\u201d film as \u201caccessible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about a relationship, and that relationship is nuanced \u2014 we\u2019ll see if kids pick that up,\u201d Chu says, referring to the complex friendship between Elphaba (Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande).",
      "\u201cI think they will fall in love with this friendship and this world. And there\u2019s a lot of things to look at and be enamored by,\u201d Chu says. \u201cBut in the end, I think they will love these two friends. And I think as a young person, when you\u2019re meeting new friends, I think that all connects with them, too.\u201d"

      "\"Wicked,\" which premieres in theaters Nov. 22, is part one of two films inspired by the hit Broadway musical of the same name. \"Wicked: Part 2\" is expected to come out one year later, in November 2025.",
      "Part 1 of the film adaptation clocks in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, making it about the same length as the entire \"Wicked\" musical. But the first film is just half of the story, following the events of Act 1 while giving moments \"a chance to breathe,\" the musical's composer Stephen Schwartz says.",
      "Other than expanding certain scenes and adding some dialogue, Part 1 of \"Wicked\" is largely faithful to the stage musical that inspired it. As for Part 2?",

      "A time jump",
      "Like the 2024 film, Act 1 of \"Wicked\" ends with \"Defying Gravity.\" When the curtain rises again after a 15-minute intermission, a lot has changed.",
      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",
      "Yang confirms there will be a time jump in Part 2 of \"Wicked.\"",
      "\"Right when we pick up, Glinda is in this very front-facing position. Pfannee and Shenshen\u00a0(Bronwyn James) are at her side still, but a lot is in motion,\" Yang says. \"The world has literally changed, and the landscape of it is very different. There is this campaign against this one person that they're like the reason for all the problems in the world.",
      "\"The story is so flexible with how it relates to our real world,\" Yang adds.",
      "A love triangle",
      "Act 2 of the musical also delivers on lingering chemistry and Elphaba's unrequited feelings for Fiyero.",
      "While Elphaba resigned herself to being \"not that girl\" in Act 1, audience members learn in the second act that the reason Fiyero joined the Wizard's army was to take an active role in searching for Elphaba, who has been missing in action but speaking out against the Wizard, his leadership and his treatment of Animals (sentient animals).",
      "When Elphaba tries to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created at the end of Act 1, she runs into the Wizard, who, after a failed attempt to again sway her to his side, turns her in to his guards.",
      "She and Fiyero reunite, and instead of bringing her to the Wizard, he helps her escape and leaves with her, abandoning Glinda.",
      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",
      "A transformation",
      "While Elphaba leads a campaign against the Wizard, her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode in the film), has taken over as governor of Munchkinland in the wake of their father's death and rules harshly. Her relationship with Boq (Ethan Slater) has soured, and he stays by Nessarose's side under duress rather than love.",
      "Elphaba visits Nessarose in Act 2, and the younger sister airs her resentment. Elphaba then casts a spell on Nessarose's silver shoes, allowing her to walk. Boq responds by announcing his intentions to leave and declare his true affections for Glinda.",
      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: Part 2\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",

      "By breaking up \"Wicked\" into two films, composer Stephen Schwartz and screenplay writer Winnie Holzman had \"freedom\" to let scenes and moments \"breathe.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of scenes that Winnie wrote, there were a couple of songs that I tried for the first movie that we wound up not putting in the movie, but the essence of what we were trying to accomplish got into the movie,\" Schwartz says.",

      "\"There are two new songs in the second movie because they felt they were dramatically necessary,\" Schwartz says.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Nov 2024 18:06:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The movie \"Gladiator II\" features scenes involving rhinos, baboons and sharks. A professor explains whether these animals were actually featured in the Roman Colosseum.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "The image of a gladiator standing tall on top of a charging rhino flying through the Roman Colosseum became one of the shining moments of the \u201cGladiator II\u201d trailer \u2014 but the idea actually took more than two decades to complete.",
      "Director Ridley Scott first came up with the idea to stage a man-versus-rhino fight for the original \u201cGladiator\u201d film in 2000, but it was too dangerous to film with a real rhinoceros and too expensive to do with CGI, according to the \u201cGladiator II\u201d press notes.",
      "It was when the film\u2019s special effects supervisor Neil Corbould found old storyboards of the rhino fight that he and Scott decided to make the scene a reality for the sequel, which premiered in theaters on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cWhen I sat down with Ridley to talk about this film I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got something to show you,\u2019 and pulled them out. And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it this time,\u2019\u201d Corbould recalled in the press notes.",
      "\u201cGladiator II\u201d producer Douglas Wick said the team learned \u201ca lot from the showmen of the ancient arena\u201d when they researched the first film.",
      "\u201cAs we contemplated a sequel, we reached back 2,000 years for guidance on how to top ourselves,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cThey had great answers. Enter the rhino.\u201d",
      "But is a gladiator facing a charging rhino something that could have actually happened in the Roman Colosseum? What about fending off a pack of ferocious, starved baboons, like Lucius, played by Paul Mescal, does while he's handcuffed?",
      "Lauren D. Ginsberg, associate professor of classical studies and theater studies at Duke University, gives TODAY.com an inside look into the historical accuracy of the three gladiator battles in the film featuring some seemingly absurd animals.",
      "\u201cThe goal, of course, was to have the strangest animals you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Ginsberg says of the spectacles inside of the Colosseum. \u201cAnd that can mean animals no one has ever seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea was, especially for the Colosseum, the emperor can bring the whole Roman world to you,\u201d Ginsberg, who was not involved in the film, continues. \u201cAnd also every emperor has to do something flashier and more exciting and more innovative than the previous person.\u201d",
      "So, enter the rhino. And baboons. But sharks? Surprisingly, only one of these animals was completely out of the question in the Roman Empire, Ginsberg says.",
      "Could gladiators fight rhinos?",
      "While rhinos could appear in Roman arenas, gladiators weren't actually fighting them, Ginsberg says. Other animals could be brought in to fight each other, or professionally trained athletes could hunt the animals, she explains.",
      "But rhinos were a fan favorite among the Romans long before the Colosseum was even built.",
      "\u201cI think Julius Caesar was the first person that ever exhibited one, so even way before the Colosseum, because the Colosseum was built by the Flavian dynasty in the first century,\u201d Ginsberg says. \u201cRhinoceroses had been staples, but they weren\u2019t so common as to become boring. People were always still really excited when there was a rhinoceros.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg thinks rhinos were so popular for two main reasons.",
      "\u201cThey look interesting, but also because they\u2019re really angry creatures, or at least the way they were treated made them very angry in the arena, so they were often unpredictable, which was exciting,\u201d she says.",
      "While rhinos were a big hit at the Colosseum and other Roman arenas, Ginsberg does say there is no evidence to support a gladiator would have ever ridden one, like in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one was riding these wild animals. And part of that is that these were highly trained, very valuable athletes, so you don\u2019t actually want to put them in harm\u2019s way,\u201d she explains.",
      "What about baboons?",
      "In Lucius\u2019 first encounter with animals in the Colosseum, he\u2019s handcuffed along with several other prisoners and tasked with fighting off a slew of ravenous baboons.",
      "Wick, the film\u2019s producer, explained that many of the scenes in the movie came directly from Scott\u2019s mind.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be in a meeting discussing some story problem when Ridley would divine a solution. He thinks visually. We were pondering how to dramatize Lucius\u2019 anger as his superpower in the arena,\u201d Wick said, according to the press notes. \u201cRidley started to sketch Lucius in mortal battle with a ferocious baboon.\u201d",
      "In fact, Scott said he came up with the idea for the scene based on a real-life video of a baboon attack on a group of tourists in a parking lot in South Africa, according to the film's press notes.",
      "In the film, Lucius is not only able to fend off the baboons, but he eventually sinks his own teeth into one of the animals\u2019 arms and spits out the furry flesh. Due to his victory against the primates, he transforms from a prisoner to a gladiator.",
      "\u201cSuddenly there\u2019s a new alpha in the fight,\u201d Wick said of the scene.",
      "Ginsberg says monkeys were a possibility to appear in the arena, but they were a relatively late development and would have been hunted for sport.",
      "\u201cThe one reference that I found was Antoninus Pius was, at that time, credited with giving, like, the biggest possible Roman games of all time, which every emperor got, so every time it had to be more,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cHe brought monkeys from Africa, but they don\u2019t seem to have been the highlight of that show,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey were there, but they weren\u2019t the most famous animals. He also had rhinoceroses. And people were more into them.\u201d",
      "Other land animals Ginsberg found that took part in arena spectacles include elephants, ostriches, bears, bulls, lions, leopards, tigers, panthers and more.",
      "Ginsberg spoke of a large industry throughout the Roman Empire dedicated to locating exotic animals and transporting them back to the emperor, as well as teams of trainers and caretakers who kept the animals alive \u2014 and ready to fight.",
      "\u201cThere was a whole industry of people from, like, the moment you decided, \u2018I want an elephant from Africa,\u2019 that would be in charge of getting it, storing it, transporting it on a boat, getting it to where it needs to be, under the Colosseum, making sure it doesn\u2019t die, and then making sure it\u2019s ready to go out and give people the show that you want,\u201d she says.",
      "The baboon scene is also a great example of how differently gladiators were treated from prisoners, according to Ginsberg.",
      "\u201cGladiators would never be handcuffed because they\u2019re prized athletes. You came to watch them fight, and so handcuffing them would just not be interesting,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut prisoners, you absolutely wanted them to have no escape, and you also wanted them to die in the most dehumanizing way possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I tell my students, the Romans are jerks. Very interesting, but they\u2019re jerks,\u201d she adds.",
      "Sharks?",
      "In one of Lucius' clashes, the Colosseum is filled with water \u2014 and man-eating tiger sharks \u2014 as dozens of gladiators fight for their lives on ships in a staged naval battle.",
      "Ginsberg says that sharks would have never been in the Colosseum, or any ancient Roman amphitheater. \u201cI\u2019m willing to stake my reputation on this,\u201d she says through laughter.",
      "\u201cI actually have no proof that the Romans even knew what sharks were,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of sharks in the Mediterranean \u2014 it\u2019s not a very common creature ... but I racked my brain trying to think of anyone in the classical world that actually talks about sharks.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg did say that if the Romans knew that something like a great white or a hammerhead shark existed, and could find a way to transport it (Ginsberg notes there was unlikely to be any technology at the time to support such a journey), they would have \u201cbeen all about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey would have thought that was fantastic, and absolutely would have used them all the time, because they especially like sea creatures,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for sure, no.\u201d",
      "Ginsberg says there is evidence to support that some semiaquatic animals, like crocodiles and seals, were used in battles, as it was possible for the Colosseum to be filled with water.",
      "She cites works from Martial, a Roman poet who described watching reenactments of Roman naval engagements, as well as evidence of pipes and drains in the Colosseum itself that seems to suggest water could have been both brought in and removed.",
      "\u201cI think the estimates are, like, five hours to fill it and four hours to drain it,\u201d she says.",
      "Ginsberg adds that prisoners were the most likely to be used in these staged historical mock battles, which mainly showed Rome being triumphant against an easily stereotyped culture, often with exotic costumes.",
      "\u201cThose would not be professional gladiators. Those would often be condemned prisoners, because the idea would be that most of those people would drown and die, right? So you didn\u2019t want your top sports athletes doing that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t there would be, like, extra danger in the water, like sharks or other creatures.\u201d"

He isolated me from my whole entire life, he wouldn\u2019t let me be who I wanted to be, he made me hate everything that I loved about myself. He broke me down and then made me feel like he was all I had left, and he just kept repeatedly beating me down and beating me down.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast episode, she gave specific incidents of their fights. For example, LaPaglia said Bryan took issue with a dress she wore to the Golden Globes this past January.",
      "\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want to date someone who presents themselves that way,\u201d she said. \u201cHe makes me believe that I have to change my image to keep up with his, or something, so I was twisted in the head \u2014 OK, yeah, he doesn\u2019t want to be with a girl that, I don\u2019t know, has cleavage,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "Post breakup, LaPaglia said she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cdefined\u201d by their relationship. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I let my career be defined by what he did to me,\u201d she said on TikTok on Nov. 20.",
      "What does an NDA have to do with this?",
      "Also on the Nov. 7 episode of the podcast, LaPaglia said that Bryan wanted her to sign an NDA after their breakup and offered her $12 million and a New York apartment in exchange for her silence.",
      "She said she considered the offer \u201cfor a second,\u201d but said no because she doesn\u2019t \u201cthink you can pay people off that you hurt for them to protect you.\u201d",

      "LaPaglia said she didn\u2019t take the money so that she could speak out for other victims of emotional abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just for me, it\u2019s for anyone else that\u2019s been emotionally abused, it\u2019s for people right now that are being emotionally abused, it\u2019s for people that don\u2019t have a support system that I was luckily enough to have going through this. And the last year of my life has been the hardest year of my life, like dealing with the abuse from this dude,\u201d she said.",
      "LaPaglia said she wants to be a voice for survivors in a Nov. 20 TikTok video. \u201cI want to show people that it\u2019s OK to continue on with your life, and when it\u2019s hard to, that you have to \u2014 or you won\u2019t,\u201d she continued.",
      "She said she\u2019s gotten \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of DMs a day from men and women who have \u201cgotten the courage\u201d to leave their relationships or \u201cfinally felt validated.\u201d"

      "Lizzo has been open with fans about her weight-loss experience, sharing recipes, workouts and healthy habits on her social media pages.",
      "Earlier this year, the singer told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0that she\u2019s on a \u201cnatural weight-loss journey,\u201d that has led her to be \u201cmethodical, losing weight very slowly.\u201d",
      "In September, Lizzo took to social media to call out rumors that she had taken a weight loss medication to achieve results.",
      "\u201cWhen you finally get ozempic allegations after 5 months of weight training and calorie deficit,\u201d Lizzo wrote over a short selfie video.",
      "The following month, Lizzo poked fun at the Ozempic allegations, as well as a joke made on an episode of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d\u00a0by dressing as \u201cLizzOzempic\u201d for Halloween.",

      "The beloved story of \u201cWicked\u201d has just made its debut on the big screen, and fans of the onstage musical might notice some changes.",
      "Both the movie and musical versions of \u201cWicked\u201d are based on the 1995 novel by Gregory Maguire, following the friendship between Elphaba and Glinda \u2014 two witches popularized by the \u201cWizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "The \"Wicked\" film adaptation is split into two parts. The first movie, which hit theaters Nov. 22, follows the events and songs of Act 1 of the musical. \"Wicked: Part 2\" is expected in November 2025.",
      "Director Jon M. Chu tells TODAY.com that he approached making the film adaptation from \u201ca very specific perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw it for the first time in San Francisco before it made it to Broadway,\u201d he says, referring to the musical\u2019s 2003 tryout performances before it opened at the Gershwin Theatre. \u201cThose are like core memories of when Glinda comes down in the bubble and during \u2018Defying Gravity,\u2019 \u2018What Is This Feeling?\u2019 \u2014 these things stayed with me through all of those years.",
      "\u201cSo I feel like I channel that first time seeing it,\u201d Chu adds.",
      "Composer Stephen Schwartz and \u201cWicked\u201d screenplay writer Winnie Holzman say when the show opened on Broadway in October 2003, they \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine being in November of 2003, having survived until that\u201d \u2014\u00a0much less a film adaptation.",
      "But once they did make it to November 2003, and the show proved a success, \u201cwe knew eventually it was going to be a movie,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "\u201cSo really for 20 years, we've been talking, particularly Winnie and myself, about 'Well, in the movie, what if we do this? Maybe we should try that?'\" Schwartz says. \"We've been thinking about it for a long time, but what was most important to us was to tell our story in the movie.\"",
      "The first \u201cWicked\u201d film is faithful to Act 1 of the musical, all the way down to the soundtrack. No songs were cut, and with the exception of one song \u201cexpansion\u201d \u2014 as composer Stephen Schwartz puts it \u2014\u00a0the tracks are true to the original Broadway cast recording.",
      "But there are some minor changes that devoted \u201cWicked\u201d fans may pick up on.",
      "Chu notes that even if what happens on screen isn\u2019t exactly what happened on the stage, his goal was \u201cre-enacting those moments that I felt back then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat it felt like was happening, I tried to do that in the movie,\u201d he says.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the differences between the \u201cWicked\u201d film and musical.",
      "The length",
      "Despite being only a portion of the beloved musical, the movie runs over two and a half hours, nearly as long as the full Broadway production.",
      "\u201cThis one movie is longer than the first act,\u201d Schwartz says. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of the first act in terms of the storytelling, but it\u2019s as long as our whole show.\u201d",
      "Holzman says Chu felt \u201creally confident\u201d about the decision to split the movie in two. Once that happened, she says she had \u201cfreedom\u201d to slow down moments that may have happened quickly in the musical.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments that we ... really wanted to take and \u2014 \u201d Holzman says.",
      "\u201cGive them a chance to breathe,\u201d Schwartz adds.",
      "Trying to fit all of the \u201cWicked\u201d musical into one film would have been a \u201cburden,\u201d Schwartz says.",
      "\u201cIt was great not to constantly feel, with every musical moment, with every scene, \u2018Oh, we simply don\u2019t have time,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cOnce that burden was lifted, it was very inspiring.\u201d",
      "Both Schwartz and Holzman wrote new songs and scenes for Part 1 that didn't end up in the final cut.",
      "\u201cWe tried to be very careful that anything we expanded was additive and not padded,\u201d he says.",
      "An expanded backstory for Elphaba and Nessarose",
      "In both \u201cWicked\u201d the musical and movie, Elphaba\u2019s backstory is explored in the opening track, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\u201d The song, sung by Glinda, walks through how Elphaba\u2019s mom drank a green elixir before having an affair, which ultimately leads to her baby arriving with a tinted skin tone. After Elphaba is born, her father wants nothing to do with her.",
      "But the movie takes a beat to show what her childhood looked like. After her birth, Elphaba's nanny, a bear named Dulcibear, raises the child and vowed to look after her. Her relationship with her younger sister Nessarose is also explored more deeply.",
      "\u201cThere are things that go past in lightning speed, like the two sisters,\u201d Holzman says of the \u201cWicked\u201d musical. \u201cWhen you first meet them, if you blink, you miss their conversation.\u201d",
      "In the movie, there's a scene where Elphaba is bullied as a child for her appearance. It also establishes a loving and protective relationship with Nessarose by showing Elphaba fight back after the kids make her sister cry.",
      "Nessarose, played by Marissa Bode, also asserts independence in the film. Bode, who is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life, says her character goes off to attend Shiz University to be on her own and \u201cprove to yourself that you can, even though you already know that you can,\u201d Bode says.",
      "In the musical, Elphaba arrives at Shiz as an enrolled student under strict orders to look after her sister. In the movie, however, Elphaba isn't enrolled, and only stays at school after she accidentally uses her powers, catching the eye of Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh).",
      "More details on the Grimmerie",
      "While most of the songs of the \u201cWicked\u201d movie soundtrack are the same as the musical, \u201cOne Short Day\u201d has a notable addition.",
      "The song follows Glinda and Elphaba as they arrive in the Emerald City to meet with the Wizard of Oz. The movie\u2019s version of \u201cOne Short Day\u201d includes new bars of music sung by \u2014\u00a0much to Broadway fans\u2019 delight \u2014 Idina Menzel, who originated the role of Elphaba, and Kristin Chenoweth, the original Glinda.",
      "In the cameo, they jokingly battle for the spotlight and sing some of their iconic riffs.",
      "Menzel and Chenoweth perform as part of the Emerald City players troupe, taking on the roles of fabled Wise Ones who wrote down their spells in a book known as the Grimmerie.",
      "The Grimmerie ends up being the key to Elphaba unlocking her powers and transforming into a witch, and the movie gives more details on how it led to the Wizard assuming power.",
      "According to the Wise Ones\u2019 prophetic song, \u201cin Oz\u2019s darkest hour,\u201d a powerful figure with the ability to read the Grimmerie will come along and lead Oz. That person ended up being the Wizard, after he landed in Oz via a hot air balloon. Now can he actually read the Grimmerie? That\u2019s another story.",
      "\u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 Easter eggs",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d is notably a prequel story to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d but Part 1 of the film offers more Easter eggs to L. Frank Baum\u2019s story and the 1939 film.",
      "While both the film and musical open with the rousing musical number \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked,\u201d set after the death of the Wicked Witch of the West, the movie firmly places the story in time with \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d",
      "The first scene of the film features the voice of Ariana Grande's Glinda declaring the Wicked Witch of the West dead. The camera pans to a black witch's hat sitting atop a puddle of water, a reference to how the witch melted in the 1939 film after Dorothy threw a pail of water at her.",
      "\u201cWe drop into a crime scene. We don\u2019t drop into a big musical number, we drop into a puddle of water,\u201d Chu says. \u201cTo me, that was really important to return us to the scene of the crime, the place we last left Oz.\u201d",
      "From there, Oz comes into full focus. Viewers see someone escaping a castle on horseback. Then the camera pans to the yellow brick road, as the figures of Dorothy and her companions follow the path toward the Emerald City.",
      "The focus then moves into Munchkinland, and the opening notes of \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked\u201d kick in.",
      "In another \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d connection, the movie changes a scene to involve poppy flowers. After Dr. Dillamond is removed from his teaching position, a new teacher brings in a lion cub to teach a lesson on cages. Elphaba, noticing the cub is trembling, casts a spell in the musical to cause chaos and help rescue the animal.",
      "But in the movie, Elphaba accidentally uses poppy flowers to put everyone in the classroom \u2014 except for herself and Jonathan Bailey's Fiyero \u2014 to sleep. Then, they rescue the cub and set him free in the wild.",
      "The poppies seem to foreshadow a scene in the \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d when the four main characters \u2014 Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion \u2014 travel through a field of the same flowers. In the story, both Dorothy and the Lion fall asleep.",
      "Later, once Elphaba and Glinda are in Oz, the Wizard shows them his vision of the city, including a long winding road. He runs through several options for the color of the pathway, and Glinda ultimately suggests making the brick road yellow."

She beat by a slim margin incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, who stood at 19.15%. George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, took 13.87%.",
      "It is the first time in Romania\u2019s 35-year post-communist history for the PSD not to have a candidate in the second round of a presidential race, serving a huge blow to the country\u2019s most powerful party and underscoring voters\u2019 anti-establishment sentiment.",
      "After polls closed on Sunday, 9.4 million people \u2014 about 52.5% of eligible voters \u2014 had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau. The second round of the vote will be held on Dec. 8. Georgescu, 62, won 43.3% of the vote in Romania\u2019s large diaspora, compared to Lasconi who got 26.8%.",
      "Most local surveys predicted he would win less than 10% of the vote.",
      "The president serves a five-year term in the European Union and NATO member country and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.",

      "According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania\u2019s environment ministry in the 1990s.

      "But his rising popularity will be tested when he faces Lasconi.",
      "Lasconi, a former journalist and the leader of the USR, has been running on an anti-corruption reformist agenda. She told The Associated Press ahead of the vote, that she saw corruption as one of the biggest problems Romania faces and expressed support toward increased defense spending and continued aid to Ukraine. If she wins the final vote, she will be the first female president in Romania\u2019s history.",

    "summary": "The number of children recruited by gangs in Haiti by 70% in the past year, according to a report released by UNICEF.",
    "story": [
      "Gangs in Haiti are recruiting children at unprecedented levels, with the number of minors targeted soaring by 70% in the past year, according to a report released Monday by UNICEF.",
      "Currently, between 30% to 50% of all gang members in the violence-wracked country are children, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cThis is a very concerning trend,\u201d said Geeta Narayan, UNICEF\u2019s representative in Haiti.",
      "The increase comes as poverty deepens and violence increases amid political instability, with gangs that control 85% of Port-au-Prince attacking once peaceful communities in a push to assume total control of the capital.",
      "Young boys are often used as informers \u201cbecause they\u2019re invisible and not seen as a threat,\u201d Narayan said in a phone interview from Haiti. Some are given weapons and forced to participate in attacks.",
      "Girls, meanwhile, are forced to cook, clean and even used as so-called \u201cwives\u201d for gang members.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not doing this voluntarily,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cEven when they are armed with weapons, the child here is the victim.\u201d",
      "Easy prey",
      "In a country where more than 60% of the population lives on less than $4 a day and hundreds of thousands of Haitians are starving or nearing starvation, recruiting children is often easy.",
      "One minor who was in a gang said he was paid $33 every Saturday, while another said he was paid thousands of dollars in his first month in a gang operation, according to a U.N. Security Council report.",
      "\u201cChildren and families are becoming increasingly desperate in some cases because of the extreme poverty,\u201d Narayan said.",
      "If children refuse to join a gang, gunmen often threaten them or their families or simply abduct them.",
      "Gangs also prey on children who are separated from their families after they are deported from the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola.",
      "\u201cThose children are increasingly the ones targeted,\u201d Narayan said.",
      "Gangs aren\u2019t the only threat as a vigilante movement that began last year to target suspected gang members gains momentum.",
      "UNICEF said children \u201care often viewed with suspicion, and risk being branded as spies or even killed by vigilante movements. When they defect or refuse to join the violence, their lives and safety are immediately at risk.\u201d",
      "A video posted on social media last week after gangs attacked an area around an upscale community showed the body of a child lying next to an adult who also was slain. Police said that at least 28 suspected gang members were killed that day as residents armed with guns and machetes fought side-by-side with officers.",
      "Increased vulnerability",
      "The gangs that recruit the most children are 5 Segond, Brooklyn, Kraze Barye, Grand Ravine and Terre Noire, according to the U.N. Security Council report.",
      "Usually, new recruits are ordered to buy food and are given money to \u201cbuy friends\u201d as gangs observe them. Then, they participate in confrontations and are promoted if they kill someone, for example. After two or three years in the gang, the recruit becomes part of the entourage if they prove they weren\u2019t a spy, according to the report.",
      "Recruitment is surging as many schools remain closed and children become increasingly vulnerable, with gang violence leaving more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years, including an estimated 365,000 minors. Many of them live in makeshift shelters where they\u2019re preyed upon by gangs and face physical and sexual violence.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups in Haiti are subjecting girls and women to horrific sexual abuse,\u201d stated a report published Monday by Human Rights Watch.",
      "The report quoted a 14-year-old girl from the capital who said she was abducted and raped multiple times by different men for five days in a house with six other girls who also were raped and beaten.",
      "Human Rights Watch noted that while fighting between armed groups has decreased this year, attacks on Haitians, police and critical infrastructure has increased.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups have often used sexual violence to instill fear in rival territories,\u201d it said.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s not all rosy\u2019",
      "Gangs are targeting children as young as eight years old, and the longer they spend with an armed group, the harder it is to rescue them and reintegrate them into society, according to experts.",
      "Violence is rewarded and encouraged, which Narayan said is extremely harmful to a child\u2019s psychosocial development.",
      "Children quit gangs in several ways: some leave willingly, others escape and sometimes nonprofits will find them and take them to centers where they receive medical care if needed as well as psychological help and other aid.",
      "\u201cThere is a transition period,\u201d Narayan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all rosy. It does take time on all sides.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As delegates from 175 countries gathered in Busan, South Korea, on Monday for the fifth round of talks aimed at securing an international treaty to curb plastic pollution, lingering divisions cast doubts on whether a final agreement is in sight.",
      "South Korea is hosting the fifth and ostensibly final U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) meeting this week, after the previous round of talks in Ottawa in April ended without a path forward on capping plastic production.",
      "Instead, talks will be focused on chemicals of concern and other measures after petrochemical-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and China strongly opposed efforts to target plastic production over the protests of countries that bear the brunt of plastic pollution.",
      "The divisions plaguing plastics treaty talks echo conflicts that have long stalled U.N. efforts to curb global warming, with the most recent climate summit,\u00a0COP29, having just ended with an agreement that poorer nations assailed as inadequate.",
      "\u201cWithout significant intervention, the amount of plastic entering the environment annually by 2040 is expected to nearly double compared to 2022,\u201d INC Chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso said at the opening session in Busan on Monday.",
      "\u201cIt is about humanity rising to meet an existential challenge,\u201d he said, noting that microplastics have been found in human organs.",
      "The United States raised eyebrows\u00a0in August\u00a0when it said it would back plastic production caps in the treaty, putting it in alignment with the European Union, Kenya, Peru and other countries in the High Ambition Coalition.",
      "The election of Donald Trump as president, however, has raised questions about that position, as during his first presidency he shunned multilateral agreements and any commitments to slow or stop U.S. oil and petrochemical production.",
      "The U.S. delegation did not answer questions on whether it would reverse its new position to support plastic production caps. But it \u201csupports ensuring that the global instrument addresses plastic products, chemicals used in plastic products, and the supply of primary plastic polymers,\u201d according to a spokesperson for the White House Council on Environmental Quality.",
      "Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said she was confident that the talks would end with an agreement, pointing to the communiqu\u00e9 from the Group of 20 nations at a summit last week calling for a legally binding treaty by the end of this year.",
      "For a Pacific island country such as Fiji, a global plastics treaty is crucial to protect its fragile ecosystem and public health, said Sivendra Michael, Fiji\u2019s climate minister and chief climate and plastics negotiator.",
      "He told Reuters on the sidelines of the 29th U.N. Climate Change Conference this month that despite not producing any plastic, Fiji is bearing the brunt of its downstream pollution.",
      "\u201cWhere do these plastics end up? It ends up in our oceans, in our landfill, in our backyards. And the impact of the plastics breaking down into little substances has detrimental effects, not only on the environment, but on us as individuals, on our health,\u201d he said, noting studies that showed most of the fish consumed in the country was polluted with microplastics.",
      "While supporting an international treaty, the petrochemical industry has been vocal in urging governments to avoid setting mandatory plastic production caps, and focus on solutions on reducing plastic waste, such as recycling.",
      "\u201cWe would see a treaty successful if it would really put ... emphasis on ending plastic pollution. Nothing else should be the focus,\u201d said Martin Jung, president for performance materials at chemical producer BASF.",
      "Previous talks have also discussed searching for forms of funding to help developing countries implement the treaty.",
      "At COP29, France, Kenya and Barbados floated setting up a series of global levies on certain sectors that could help ramp up the amount of money that could be made available to developing countries seeking support to aid their clean energy transitions and cope with the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.",
      "The proposal included a fee of $60 to $70 per ton on primary polymer production, which is on average around 5-7% of the polymer price, seen potentially raising an estimated $25 billion to $35 billion per year.",
      "Industry groups have rejected the idea, saying it will raise consumer prices."

      "One of the world\u2019s biggest sporting competitions will pit a teen phenom from India against a soft-spoken assassin from China \u2014 but it will be missing the GOAT from Norway.",
      "The 2024 World Chess Championship is set to kick off this week, a showdown between 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju of India and reigning champion Ding Liren of China. And while it is still considered the game\u2019s marquee event, the absence of Norway\u2019s Magnus Carlsen, the five-time champion who declined to defend his title in 2022, looms large.",
      "Grandmaster David Howell, a close friend of Carlsen\u2019s who is also one of the official match commentators in Singapore, believes the world championship still holds a special place in the chess world, but said this year is unique.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, it\u2019s been the one thing that defines what has been otherwise quite a disorganized tournament system,\u201d Howell said. \u201cNormally, the world championship is very successful at finding and celebrating the best player in the world. It\u2019s still got a lot of prestige, but this year it\u2019s a bit of a strange one.\u201d",
      "In some ways, this should be the biggest world championship yet.",
      "A chess boom during the pandemic has made the game more popular than ever, but that surge of interest has mainly been felt online. Chess.com now boasts 190 million users worldwide, up from 51 million in January 2020. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform told NBC News that 1 in 10 Americans have an account. Chess.com is also busy organizing its own money-spinning tournaments, slowly encroaching on the game\u2019s governing body, the International Chess Federation, also known as FIDE.",
      "That\u2019s led to a growing discussion over whether the championship format \u2014 14 games that often last more than three hours each \u2014 still works for a game that is often embracing quicker matches.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big debate over whether it needs to be modernized, or whether it\u2019s still the most efficient way of finding the best player in the world,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI still think it does a fantastic job at that. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the world No. 1 has stepped aside.\u201d",
      "The legacy of Magnus Carlsen",
      "Carlsen, who has dominated the chess world for over a decade, vacated the title in 2022, citing a lack of motivation. While Ding technically succeeded Carlsen, the Norwegian remains the consensus best player in the world and the sport\u2019s most marketable figure.",
      "Known as the \u201cGOAT\u201d (a popular acronym for the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d), Carlsen has been a towering presence in chess since his teenage years. His last title defense, a dramatic series against Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi in 2021, drew record-breaking online audiences. At the height of the chess boom fueled by the pandemic and Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Carlsen seemed poised to turn chess into a mainstream spectator sport.",
      "However, in 2022 Carlsen\u2019s image took a hit when he was drawn into a cheating scandal. Carlsen implied grandmaster Hans Niemann, then a teenager and one of the game\u2019s rising young stars, cheated when he beat him at the Sinquefield Cup. It led to a $100 million lawsuit before the players settled in August last year and said they had moved on from their rift. The terms of the settlement have not been made public.",
      "Howell noted that it\u2019s not particularly rare for the world chess championship to be without the game\u2019s top player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s happened throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been several cases of a player being world champion, but maybe not being the strongest on paper. Thinking back, there was Max Euwe, maybe [Vasily] Smyslov, [Tigran] Petrosian and then [Vladimir] Kramnik later on. They weren\u2019t the No. 1 at the time, but they were the world champion.\u201d",
      "The stakes for Ding and Gukesh",
      "Beyond Carlsen\u2019s absence, the game of chess and its upcoming championship also face some broader challenges, including geopolitical tensions and questions about the form of one of the competitors.",
      "The most immediate challenge is Ding. The reigning champ is a move-calculating machine. But as he prepares for the biggest test of his career, Ding has at times looked badly out of sorts.",
      "Ding claimed the championship in 2023 after a dramatic match against Nepomniachtchi. The series was tied 7-7 after three weeks, with Ding recovering from a terrible start to clinch a comeback victory. It was a proud moment for China and affirmed its status as a chess superpower. But since then, the 32-year-old\u2019s form has gone from bad to worse.",
      "After taking a nine-month break, Ding returned to competition with disappointing results. His performance at Norway Chess in June was particularly alarming after he lost four games in a row \u2014 an unprecedented showing for a world champion. Ding has looked anxious at times, and his results have seen him slump to world No. 23 in the latest FIDE rankings.",
      "Ding admitted to mental health challenges, revealing how self-doubt and anxiety have affected his game.",
      "Facing Ding in this year\u2019s championship is Gukesh, a prodigy aiming to become the youngest world champion in history. Gukesh represents a new wave of Indian talent inspired by Viswanathan Anand, India\u2019s first world champion, who won the title in 2007 to break Russia\u2019s stranglehold over the sport.",
      "In stark contrast to Ding\u2019s struggles, Gukesh has been in serene form. In September, he led India to its first-ever team gold at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, scoring an impressive 9/10. Currently ranked 18 places above Ding, Gukesh has overtaken his rival as the favorite.",
      "Politics and power struggles",
      "Adding to the intrigue is the championship\u2019s political backdrop. Chess likes to present itself as a major world sport, but it remains one of the few still dominated by Russian leadership. FIDE, the international chess federation, is headed by Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister.",
      "Despite global sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, FIDE has retained strong ties to Moscow, fueling criticism that the game is a tool of Russian soft power.",
      "Russia\u2019s influence on chess is long-standing. For decades, Soviet and Russian players dominated the world championship, with only a few exceptions like Bobby Fischer and Anand breaking the mold. This year, however, there are no Russian contenders in the final, a rarity that underscores the shifting landscape of global chess. Nepomniachtchi is the sole Russian in the top 10.",
      "Howell points to \u201ca clear shift\u201d over the past 10 years away from Russia and toward China and India.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many resources are going into chess in China. It\u2019s very much a mystery. But in India, a huge amount of government support and sponsorship is funding chess. It\u2019s not a coincidence that there\u2019s a golden generation emerging right now. So in terms of dominance, India seems to be the new Russia.",
      "\u201cThis is the battle of Asia,\u201d Howell added. \u201cIt is the two superpowers, India and China, battling it out. They\u2019re not going to be the first Asian world champions, but it\u2019s still huge for growing the game in India, which is probably the biggest chess economy right now.\u201d",
      "The 14-game match will run until Dec. 12 (or 13 if tiebreaks are needed). The FIDE World Chess Championship is presented by Google, with online coverage and commentary provided by FIDE and Chess.com."
