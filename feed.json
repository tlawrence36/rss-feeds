      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said Monday it's investigating a new sexual battery allegation against hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is serving a four-year prison sentence on prostitution-related convictions.",
      "A male music producer and publicist said he was asked to come to a photo shoot in 2020 at a Los Angeles warehouse, where Combs exposed himself while masturbating and told the accuser to assist, according to NBC News, citing a police report. Combs then tossed a dirty shirt at the man, the producer said.",
      "The accuser, whose name is redacted in the police report, said he did not tell anyone for several years because he felt embarrassed. He came forward to police in Largo, Florida, this September, shortly after Combs was convicted on other charges.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyer did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the latest allegations.",
      "The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said it received an official copy of the report from the Florida department on Friday, and will be investigating the allegations.",

      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has announced its next spring fashion exhibit",
      "NEW YORK -- If there's been one uniting theme of all the blockbuster fashion exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it\u2019s the simple idea that fashion is art.",
      "\u201cCostume Art,\u201d announced Monday as the next big show at the museum\u2019s Costume Institute \u2014 launched by the starry Met Gala in 2026 \u2014 aims to make that connection more literal than ever, pairing garments with objects from across the museum to show how fashion has long been intertwined with different art forms.",
      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",
      "\u201cI hope we all agree that fashion is art,\u201d Hollein added. \u201cBut actually I think the exhibition \u2026 will make it obvious how fashion is actually happening, so to say, all across the museum and in all different mediums already.\u201d",
      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "The third installment of the \u201cNow You See Me\u201d series has topped the North American box office, beating \u201cThe Running Man\u201d this weekend",
      "It\u2019s no magic trick: The third installment in the thieving magician \u201cNow You See Me\u201d series beat the high-profile action pic \u201cThe Running Man\u201d at the North American box office this weekend. Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t\u201d pulled in $21.3 million, while Paramount\u2019s \u201cThe Running Man\u201d made $17 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t,\u201d which cost a reported $90 million to produce, comes almost 10 years after the second film. Including ticket sales from 64 international territories, its worldwide opening is estimated to be around $75.5 million. Going into the weekend, it was expected to be a closer race between the two newcomers.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t see us being number one for the weekend about 10 days ago,\u201d Kevin Grayson, the president of worldwide distribution for Lionsgate's motion picture group, said Sunday. \u201cBut as we started to get closer and ticket sale numbers started to pop, we saw that there was going to be a horse race. Then we pulled away Saturday morning.\u201d",
      "Grayson said it's a testament not only to the franchise but the marketing and publicity strategies which, \u201creally helped us get into a position where we now can play all the way through the holiday corridor.\u201d",
      "The first two movies in the \u201cNow You See Me\u201d series, released in 2013 and 2016, earned over $686 million worldwide. This installment, directed by Ruben Fleischer, sees the return of the original \u201cFour Horsemen,\u201d Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, and introduces three younger magicians into the mix: Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt and Justice Smith. A fourth film is already in the works.",
      "Reviews were mixed on Rotten Tomatoes, coming in at 59%. According to PostTrak polling, audiences were a bit more positive, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend.",
      "Audience scores were slightly less for \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d which had a 58% \u201cdefinitely recommend.\u201d Both earned a B+ CinemaScore, but more people chose the franchise. One key difference is that women made up more of the \u201cNow You See Me\u201d audience (54%). They only accounted for 37% of \u201cThe Running Man\u201d ticket buyers.",
      "Edgar Wright directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d the second adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel, first published in 1982. The first film starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and was released in 1987 to mixed reviews and a tepid box office, earning only $38 million against a $27 million budget. The new version stars Glen Powell, who has had a good track record starring in box office hits, from the romantic comedy \u201cAnyone But You\u201d to \u201cTwisters.\u201d",
      "Paramount Pictures released \u201cThe Running Man\u201d in 3,400 domestic locations and 58 international markets. Worldwide, it earned $28.2 million against a reported $110 million budget.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other new opener, \u201cKeeper,\u201d the third feature from \u201cLonglegs\u201d filmmaker Oz Perkins, cratered with $2.5 million and a D+ CinemaScore. But as an acquisition title for Neon, it\u2019s also not a disaster.",
      "Third place went to \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d with $13 million in its second weekend, followed by \u201cRegretting You\u201d in fourth with $4 million. \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d rounded out the top five with $2.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.7 million after five weeks in theaters.",

      "The box office should pick up considerably when \u201cWicked 2\u201d blows into theaters, followed by \u201cZootopia 2\u201d before the Thanksgiving holiday. Comscore's Paul Dergarabedian said it could be one of the highest grossing five-day Thanksgiving frames of all time.",

      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "He's in fact the rare character who repeats outfits, Friedberg notes. \u201cYou can kind of see them, as the series goes along, getting a little bit more and more threadbare,\u201d she says.",
      "Gerber\u2019s character gets a major makeover this season after coming into money. The actor gushed about Friedberg\u2019s intentional designs as Mitzi finds her \u201cwomanhood and her power.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was so fun to be able to be wearing these expensive gowns and jewelry and the hair and the makeup, and how that really sort of parallels Mitzi\u2019s inner journey as well,\u201d she says.",
      "The costumes may be eye candy, but Friedberg says each look also carries deeper meaning.",
      "\u201cMaxine wears this dress that was an original Oscar de la Renta dress,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much something that Norma would wear, and it is saying to the audience without saying to the audience that she\u2019s arrived, it\u2019s her time, it\u2019s time for her to rule.\u201d",

      "The BBC has apologized to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it strongly disagreed that there was a basis for a defamation lawsuit",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",
      "Trump had set a deadline of Friday, Nov. 14 for the BBC to respond to his challenge.",

      "While the BBC said earlier in the week that the edited portion in the program was an \u201cerror of judgement,\" it did not apologize to Trump directly until Thursday evening.",
      "In a statement, it said its chair, Samir Shah, had personally sent a letter via a letter from its chair over the misleading edit but said it had not defamed him.",
      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble. Some think it leans too much to the right, while others think it goes the other way. Whatever the truth of the matter, many think that the BBC is often cowed in its coverage, particularly on domestic political matters.",
      "Not only does it need to find a new director-general and head of news, it has to negotiate its future with the government.",
      "The left-of-center Labour government, which is considered to one of the most pro-BBC political parties in the U.K., will soon start the once-a-decade process of reviewing the BBC\u2019s governing charter, which expires at the end of 2027.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the government would ensure the BBC is \u201csustainably funded (and) commands the public\u2019s trust,\u201d but did not say whether the license fee might be scaled back or scrapped.",

      "The White House Historical Association is hoping to reclaim a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell that once hung in the West Wing",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association is bidding to reclaim a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell that once hung in the West Wing but ended up at auction after a family dispute over their ownership.",
      "The association could face some stiff competition as the opening bid is $2.5 million and auction house clients have been lining up with offers.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches are titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d and depict people from all walks of life hanging out in the White House lobby as they anticipate meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail. It wants to add the drawing to the vast White House collection of art, furniture and other items.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",
      "\u201cIn a way, it sort of illustrates how FDR always talked about the \u2018arsenal of democracy\u2019 and what made the United States unique,\u201d said Matthew Costello, the association\u2019s chief education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible series of renderings.\u201d",
      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

      "William Elam III, a grandson of Stephen Early's, said his mother received the drawings as a gift from her father, the former press secretary, before he died, and that ownership had later passed to him.",
      "The illustrations had gone to the White House in 1978 under an agreement which obligated the White House to return them to Elam upon request. The White House gave back the drawings in 2022.",
      "A federal appeals court settled the dispute in May, upholding a lower-court ruling in favor of Elam, according to court records.",
      "Bidding will start at $2.5 million and clients are \u201cready and waiting to compete for this American icon,\u201d Christina Rees, director of communications for Heritage Auctions, said in an email. The auction house has estimated the drawings will sell for between $4 million and $6 million.",
      "That price tag could present a hurdle for the White House Historical Association, which was created in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that receives no government funding. It raises money mostly through private donations and merchandise sales, including an annual Christmas ornament.",
      "The association did not reveal how much it is willing to spend, but the most it has ever paid for a painting in the past was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "McBride said she expected stiff competition for Rockwell's work because of the broad interest in Americana, as well as the artist's work. But the association's mission is to go after art, furniture and other items it believes belong in the White House.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Sofia Coppola was 20 years old and figuring out who she wanted to be in the world, Angelica Huston offered some advice: \u201cNot everyone\u2019s going to love you. Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s not just the daughter of a great filmmaker,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d",
      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",

      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",

      "The Paidika is one of two primary infancy gospels from that time \u2014 the other being the Infancy Gospel of James \u2014 that were popular among early Christians. \u201cThey never became canonical in the strict sense, but they were always kind of something on the periphery,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",

      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular stories, such as Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing and Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, have been translated into English, building a global fan base and cracking The New York Times paperback bestseller list.",

    "story": [
      "At the halfway point of annual United Nations climate negotiations in Brazil, it appears the talks may do more than just focus on implementing past promises, as some observers had expected",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Jennifer Austin met Molly in second grade, they quickly became best friends. They giggled through classes until the teacher separated them, inspiring them to come up with their own language. They shared sleepovers and went on each other's family vacations.",
      "But they gradually drifted apart after Austin's family moved to Germany before the girls started high school. Decades passed before they recently reconnected as grown women.",
      "\u201cStrong friendships really do stay for the long haul,\" Austin, 51, said. \"Even if there are pauses in between and they fade, that doesn\u2019t mean they completely dissolve or they go forgotten. They\u2019re always there kind of lingering like a little light in the back.\u201d",
      "Early friendships are some of the deepest: the schoolmates who shared bike rides and their favorite candy. The roommates who offered comfort after breakups. The ones who know us, sometimes better than we know ourselves.",
      "But as adults take on jobs and the responsibilities of homes and families, it can be challenging to stay connected with everyone we've loved.",
      "Technology plays a role, too. Loneliness has increased since the television was invented and intensified with the introduction of smartphones, according to psychologist Marisa Franco, a University of Maryland assistant clinical professor and author of \u201cPlatonic,\u201d a book about the science of attachment.",
      "Once they've lost touch with friends, some people are reluctant to reach out, fearing rejection. But most of those on the receiving end appreciate the effort more than we expect, Franco said.",
      "\u201cPeople are delighted to hear from their old friends and open to connections,\u201d she said.",
      "Franco suggests reminiscing about a shared memory to span the time and distance. It can be something as simple as, \"This pic came up and I just realized I wanted to check in on you,\u201d she said. Propose a meetup. If the friend lives far away, try scheduling a phone date to catch up.",
      "Below, six people who tried to rekindle lost friendships reflect on distance, loss and reconnection.",
      "Heather Robb and Laine DiPasquantonio were nearly inseparable in their 20s, when they both lived in Boston. They went to concerts and vacationed together. DiPasquantonio was there when Robb met her future husband and attended their wedding as a bridesmaid.",
      "But sometime after Robb married and DiPasquantonio moved to Colorado, their circle of friends scattered. They became busy raising children, juggling jobs and caring for aging parents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible because you don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening,\u201d Robb, 60, said in a joint interview. \u201cI think it was simply space and time. We were all in different cities, we were all in that busy time of toddlers.\u201d",
      "Years passed with occasional holiday cards and texts but few meaningful interactions. DiPasquantonio saw photos on social media of Robb skiing and traveling with other friends. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure there was so much room for me, from a distance,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAww, I feel badly about that,\u201d Robb replied. \u201cI would argue that's the bad side of social media.\u201d",
      "The women found their way back to each other when Robb, president of Heather Robb Communications, had a business trip to Denver in April. She called to see if DiPasquantonio wanted to get dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if she was going to be that happy to hear from me. I actually had some trepidation in reaching out,\" Robb said.",
      "When she did, Robb learned her friend was about to undergo surgery for breast cancer. Instead of meeting for dinner, DiPasquantonio, a placement specialist at Harmony Senior Referrals, invited Robb to stay for the weekend. A mutual friend flew out to join them.",
      "\u201cI was so tickled that you called and wanted to get together. It was awesome,\u201d DiPasquantonio, 63, said during their interview. \u201cWhat took us so long, right?\u201d",

      "It's possible other deaths have happened but were assumed to be from other causes and not thoroughly investigated like this one was, said Joshua Benoit, a tick biologist at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said the agency was not involved in this investigation and could not speak definitively about whether it's the first such death. The CDC recently released a free online training module to increase awareness and improve diagnosing, she added.",

      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",

      "Synthesized peptides are not new. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions.",
      "In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings. That\u2019s driven interest in using obscure peptides for unsubstantiated uses like healing injuries, improving complexion and even extending life. Peptides in this group include an alphabet soup of injectable compounds, including BPC-157, thymosin alpha, GHK-Copper and many more. Some are banned by sports regulators as doping substances.",
      "Experts who have studied the field are particularly concerned that some people are combining multiple peptides.",
      "\u201cThese influencers are often advocating taking a stack of peptides each month, so it could be two, three, four different peptides,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research Translational Institute. \u201cThis is really what I consider dangerous.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, \u201call the experts were wrong.\u201d",
      "In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d summit in the nation's capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, saying it has been \u201ca critical part of our success in Washington.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",
      "Critics, including some of the country's leading medical associations, say that Kennedy\u2019s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary.",
      "\u201cThis closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of \u2018wellbeing influencers\u2019 and \u2018MAHA moms\u2019 whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,\u201d said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office.",
      "Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science.",
      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill that ends a record 43-day shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",
      "The Republican president blamed the situation on Democrats and suggested voters shouldn\u2019t reward the party during next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cSo I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen we come up to midterms and other things, don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve done to our country.\u201d",
      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",
      "Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.",
      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.",
      "Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.",
      "\u201cThis fight is not over,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analyzed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well. Johnson said he was \u201cvery angry about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\u201d Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.",

      "\u201cIt's a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\u201d Cole said. \u201cCOVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care and no Republican voted for it.",
      "\u201cAll they have done is try to eliminate access to health care in our country. The country is catching on to them,\u201d Pelosi said.",

      "It\u2019s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signaled they could be open to that idea.",
      "House Democrats expressed great skepticism that the Senate effort would lead to a breakthrough.",

      "Charges against the suspects could include sedition, inciting civil war, attacking security forces, murder, looting and leading armed gangs, according to state media.",

Since then, New Zealand's force has sought to reshape itself as a liberal and friendly law enforcement agency.",
      "\u201cThis is a big hit to integrity and trust for the police,\u201d Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told 1News on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be built back.\u201d",
      "Police bosses admit that won't be simple. A scathing watchdog report this month lambasted senior officers for minimizing the claims about McSkimming as he sought to become Police Commissioner. They instead pursued his accuser for online harassment.",
      "The saga emerged in August when McSkimming was revealed to be facing charges of possessing child sexual abuse material and other illegal sexual content. He admitted some of the charges earlier in November.",
      "Court documents said he viewed thousands of sexual images on work devices during office hours, including numerous illegal images. He will be sentenced in December and faces up to 10 years in prison.",
      "During a period of four and half years, about a third of all McSkimming's internet searches during work hours were for sexual content, the documents said. At the time, he was the force's Chief Security Officer.",
      "The images were discovered as investigators probed separate complaints made by a woman with whom McSkimming had an affair when she was a police employee. The woman, 21 when she met the then-40-year-old McSkimming, accused him of sexual abuse in messages to police bosses, politicians and news outlets.",
      "McSkimming's peers believed his denials without question, according to a report this month by the Independent Police Conduct Authority.",
      "The watchdog said police bosses tried to rush an investigation into the complaints because they feared it would prevent McSkimming from winning the top job, but the inquiry gained momentum when lower ranking officers challenged their bosses.",
      "No charges were laid against McSkimming over the woman's claims, but investigators charged McSkimming's accuser with online harassment of him and other officers.",
      "The charge of harassing McSkimming was dropped this month, but the woman remains before the courts on other counts.",
      "\u201cThe way her complaints were handled should alarm all New Zealanders,\u201d the woman\u2019s lawyer Steven Lack said Tuesday. \u201cIt suggests that the police were more focused on protecting Mr. McSkimming\u2019s career and advancement than on properly assessing serious allegations of offending against him.\u201d",
      "The case prompted fury in New Zealand, in part because it evoked previous episodes of police sexual misconduct and cover-up.",
      "\u201cIt was like deja vu,\u201d survivor advocate Louise Nicholas said on Tuesday. \u201cI was so saddened to see and hear, God, we\u2019re going through this again.\u201d",
      "Nicholas became a household name two decades ago over her efforts to see police officers convicted of raping her, which she said began when she was 13. The Associated Press does not usually identify people who say they were subjected to sexual abuse, but Nicholas said she preferred to have her name used.",

They have no aim and no future. I am very worried about where they will go and what they will do in the days to come.\u201d",
      "Hasina, 78, was convicted Monday on five charges of crimes against humanity. She also was sentenced to prison until natural death for making inflammatory remarks and ordering the extermination of student protesters with helicopters, drones and lethal weapons.",
      "A former police chief was sentenced to five years' imprisonment after pleading guilty and becoming a state witness against Hasina.",
      "Bangladesh experienced weeks of student-led protests in July and August last year.

More than 800 people were killed and about 14,000 were injured, Bangladesh\u2019s interim government reported. The United Nations in February estimated that as many as 1,400 people were killed.",
      "The uprising led to the collapse of Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule on Aug. 5, 2024. Hasina and Khan fled to India, which has declined to extradite them, making it unlikely they would ever be executed or imprisoned.",

      "That choice is perhaps most personal, and fraught, for Chile\u2019s 1.5 million immigrants \u2014 in particular, the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who escaped the repressive socialist government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to make this narrow sliver of a country their home.",

      "\u201cCommunism destroyed my country, and the last thing I want is for my other home to fall into that same system,\u201d said Edwin Bejar, 61, who fled political persecution in Venezuela for Chile seven years ago and plans to vote again for Kast next month.",

      "Nadra Mohamed Ahmed was seven months when she trekked for nearly 25 miles across unsafe roads",
      "CAIRO -- A few weeks before the fall of her hometown to Sudan\u2019s paramilitary group, Nadra Mohamed Ahmed, seven months pregnant at the time, trekked for nearly 40 kilometers (25 miles) across unsafe roads, along with her two children, until she found safe transportation to a shelter across the country.",
      "\u201cBy the time I arrived here, I had lost a lot of blood,\" said Ahmed from her tent at the overcrowded displacement camp in the town of al-Dabbah in northern Sudan. \"I was admitted to the ICU where I spent a few days and had a blood transfusion.\u201d",
      "Ahmed arrived in the camp fleeing from el-Fasher in West Darfur, two months before the city was seized by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, which have been battling Sudan\u2019s army for more than two years.",
      "More than 140 pregnant women arrived at al-Dabbah camps since el-Fasher's fall last month, said Tasneem Al-Amin from the Sudan Doctors Network, a group of medical professionals tracking the war. Many of these women arrive suffering severe complications, especially hemorrhaging, which sometimes culminate in a miscarriage, she told The Associated Press in a text message.",
      "Carrying her 4-year-old daughter on her back and holding her 6-year-old son\u2019s hand, Ahmed made part of her 14-day-long journey on foot without her husband, who had gone missing shortly before her escape. She rested in two nearby villages along the way until she could find transportation to al-Dabbah, a town about 1,300 kilometers (840 miles) northeast of el-Fasher.",
      "\u201cI was very exhausted on the journey. I was carrying a child on my back and another in my womb. We had nothing to eat or drink,\u201d said Ahmed, who was dressed in a maroon toub, a traditional garment worn by Sudanese women.",
      "Ahmed is one of many Sudanese pregnant women who struggle to complete their terms and give birth to healthy babies, in a country where 80% of medical facilities have collapsed in war-torn regions, according to U.N. agencies.",
      "Last week, Anna Mutavati, the U.N. women's regional director for East and Southern Africa, told reporters that Sudanese women are forced to give birth on the streets.",
      "Earlier this year, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res humanitarian group, or Doctors Without Borders, said that Darfur pregnant women undertake \u201ca harrowing journey\u201d trekking on foot across unsafe roads to seek medical care at the few remaining health care facilities, which results in delivery complications, miscarriage or death.",
      "\u201cWhen in el-Fasher, I could not have access to any medical facilities. Not until I came here in al-Dabbah did I meet doctors,\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "Ahmed ran from el-Fasher shortly after an RSF projectile had hit her house and killed her sister.",
      "\u201cWe could hardly collect my sister\u2019s remains. We witnessed horrible scenes and that is why we decided to leave,\u201d she said.",

      "The RSF also stormed the Saudi Maternity Hospital, the last functioning health facility in el-Fasher, reportedly killing 460 patients and their companions. The attack left more than 6,000 pregnant women with no access to life-saving maternal care, according to the U.N. The rampage has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes, embarking on a perilous journey, hoping to reach displacement camps.",
      "Rasha Ahmed, who is eight months pregnant, recently arrived in Tawila, a town some 60 kilometers (35 miles) west of el-Fasher. She told the International Committee of the Red Cross that she had no one to provide for her and her children, as her husband went missing after a shell had hit their home in el-Fasher.",
      "\u201cI have arrived heavily pregnant, and I don\u2019t have anything to help me after giving birth \u2014 nothing for my postpartum period,\u201d said Ahmed, whose right ear was partially chopped off in the shelling.",

      "The rate of global acute malnutrition among the 66 pregnant or lactating women who were examined upon their arrival in Tawila by Doctors Without Borders between Oct. 27 and Nov. 3 was 60%, according to Tim Shenk, a communications officer with the international medical aid group.",
      "Across the East African country, nearly 74% of women don't meet the minimum dietary diversity, which limits their nutrient intake, and hence affects maternal health and child health. Women are reportedly foraging for wild leaves and berries to boil into soup, which exposes them to additional risks of violence, including abduction and sexual assaults, according to the U.N.",
      "The war between the RSF and the military began in 2023, when tensions erupted between the two former allies that were meant to oversee a democratic transition after a 2019 uprising. The fighting has killed at least 40,000 people, according to the World Health Organization, and displaced 12 million. Aid groups say the true death toll could be many times higher.",

      "Almost four years into Russia\u2019s invasion, keeping Ukraine\u2019s lights on has become a battle of its own \u2014 fought along a moving front line. Engineers repeatedly repair transformers, switchyards, and power lines that Russia strikes again and again while using bomb-laden drones to hunt workers\u2019 trucks near the border. And that work repairing damage from Russian attacks is happening when a major embezzlement and kickbacks scandal at the state-owned nuclear power company has put top officials under scrutiny.",
      "Since the war began at least 160 energy workers have been killed, including a colleague of Mykhailo's. More than 300 others have been wounded. Yet tens of thousands still head out each day \u2014 sometimes fearful, sometimes resigned, often driven by a quiet mission to bring light through the darkness.",

      "Since the war began, Dzhuma has patched nearly 100 kilometers (65 miles) of damaged wires \u2014 not to modernize, but to restore what\u2019s been shattered.",
      "\u201cSomehow, but we still give people light,\u201d he said. He is proud of his work, even though it makes him a potential target.",
      "For many energy workers, that realization changes little in their routine. They keep showing up.",

It also represents a major purchase for the airline as Dubai prepares across both carriers to expand as it builds a five-runway airport in this desert sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The A321neo is a mid-range, two-engine, single-aisle aircraft, matching the style of the Boeing 737s that FlyDubai has relied on since launching flights back in 2009. The airline currently has a fleet of 95 aircraft.",
      "Airbus and FlyDubai declined to take questions from journalists at the announcement. Both firms referred to the order as a memorandum of understanding, signaling more negotiation are likely ahead before a firm deal.",

      "Most Australians revere Vegemite as an unfairly maligned culinary icon, and more than 80% of Australian households are estimated to have a jar in their pantries. But inmates in all 12 prisons in Victoria are going without.",
      "McKechnie is suing Victoria\u2019s Department of Justice and Community Safety and the agency that manages the prisons, Corrections Victoria. The case is scheduled for trial next year.",
      "Vegemite has been banned from Victorian prisons since 2006, with Corrections Victoria saying it \u201cinterferes with narcotic detection dogs.\u201d",
      "Inmates used to smear packages of illicit drugs with Vegemite in the hope that the odor would distract the dogs from the contraband.",
      "Vegemite also contains yeast, which is banned from Victorian prisons because of its \u201cpotential to be used in the production of alcohol,\u201d the contraband list says.",
      "A decade ago, Vegemite's then U.S. owner, Mondelez International, rejected media reports that remote Australian Indigenous communities were using Vegemite to brew alcohol in bathtubs.",
      "Mondelez said in a statement the manufacturing process killed the yeast and that \u201cVegemite cannot be fermented into alcohol.\u201d",
      "McKechnie is seeking a court declaration that the defendants denied him his right under the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act to \u201cenjoy his culture as an Australian.\u201d",
      "The Act guarantees \"All persons with a particular cultural, religious, racial or linguistic background\" the right to \u201cenjoy their culture, to declare and practice their religion and to use their language.\u201d",
      "He also wants a declaration that the defendants breached the Corrections Act by \u201cfailing to provide food adequate to maintain\u201d McKechnie\u2019s \u201cwell-being.\u201d",
      "Manufactured in Australia since 1923 as an alternative to Britain\u2019s Marmite, Vegemite was long marketed as a source of vitamin B for growing children.",
      "The spread is beloved by a majority of Australians, but typically considered an acquired taste at best by those who weren\u2019t raised on it.",
      "The last U.S. president to visit Australia, Barack Obama, once said: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible.\u201d",
      "Australian band Men at Work aroused international curiosity when they mentioned a \u201cVegemite sandwich\u201d in their 1980s hit \u201cDown Under.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs victims, we don\u2019t have any rights. We have limited, if any, support. It\u2019s always about the perpetrator, and this just reinforces that,\u201d said Herron, whose daughter Courtney Herron, was beaten to death in a Melbourne park in 2019.

There, they said, they were held for nearly a month while relatives and other villagers sold anything they could \u2014 farmland, livestock, motorcycles \u2014 to raise the ransom demanded for their release.",
      "They got little food and sleep, were told to renounce Christianity, and saw two fellow hostages killed, four of the villagers who were eventually freed told The Associated Press in interviews at their church in the Ligari community, in Nigeria\u2019s Kaduna state.",
      "\u201cI told my people even if they see my dead body, they should not deny Jesus and they should remain strong,\u201d said the Rev. Micah Bulus, resident pastor of Kauna Baptist Church.",

      "In Ligari, villagers say nearly every household has seen a relative, friend or neighbor killed or abducted. It's part of the longstanding security crisis in Nigeria \u2014 a place now singled out by U.S. President Donald Trump for \u201cthe killing of Christians\u201d by \u201cradical Islamists.\u201d",
      "Victims and church leaders echo Trump's claims that Christians are persecuted. They say they\u2019ve long been attacked, kidnapped or killed because of their faith.",
      "But many insist the reality isn't as simple as Trump's narrative, which casts Christianity as facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d in Nigeria. Experts and residents say some attacks target Christians, but most emphasize that in the widespread violence that has long plagued the West African nation, everyone is a potential victim, regardless of background or belief.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t ask you whether you are a Muslim or a Christian,\u201d 32-year-old Abdulmalik Saidu said of the gunmen regularly stalking his northwestern state, Zamfara. \"All they want is just money from you. (Even) if you have money, sometimes they will kill you.\u201d",
      "Saidu, a Muslim, said his brother was shot dead during a kidnapping operation along a major highway, and the family never recovered his body, for fear of attacks. In Kaduna, an imam told AP that he's lost a grandson, cousin and brother, and his family has been displaced twice due to violence. Other religious leaders say mosques have been destroyed, people have fled, and desperate Muslims \u2014 like their Christian neighbors \u2014 have been forced to sell goods and belongings for ransom.",

Nationwide, Muslims constitute a slight majority.",
      "Experts and data from two nonpartisan sources \u2014 the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and Council on Foreign Relations \u2014 show Christians are often targets in a small percentage of overall attacks that appear to be motivated by religion, in some northern states.",
      "But the numbers and analysts also indicate that across the north, most victims of overall violence are Muslims.",
      "Analysts and residents blame the killings on rampant corruption that limits weapons supplies to security forces, the failure to prosecute attackers, and porous borders that ensure steady weapons supplies to gangs.",
      "\u201cThese attacks are indiscriminate: They attack state institutions, they target Nigerians in their places of worship, they target Nigerians in civilian locations,\u201d said Bulama Bukarti, a Nigerian conflict researcher and human rights lawyer. \u201cIn essence, it is a war against Nigeria.\u201d",
      "In the northeast, Boko Haram jihadi extremists and, more recently, an Islamic State-backed breakaway faction have since 2009 waged an insurgency to enforce their brutal interpretation of Shariah law. In 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls \u2014 mostly Christian, but some Muslim \u2014 from a school in Chibok, in Borno state. The unprecedented attack marked a new era of fear across Nigeria. Mass abductions, particularly of students, have been on the rise since.",
      "In the northwest and central regions, rogue gangs attack villages, travelers and farming communities comprised mostly of Christians. The gangs aren't connected to Boko Haram and generally aren't motivated by religion. The ransoms they demand can reach thousands of dollars.",
      "The Ligari community, with the church where 62 were kidnapped, is less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Kaduna's capital. But its rocky road, vast forest, and lack of security posts mean villagers get little security intervention.",

      "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) \u2014 Ethiopia on Monday confirmed three deaths from the Marburg hemorrhagic virus that has been detected in an area neighboring South Sudan.",
      "Health Minister Mekdes Daba said Ethiopia's government, which declared a Marburg outbreak on Friday, had conducted tests in 17 suspected cases in the country's south. The outbreak was reported in the Omo region.",
      "The minister said there were no active cases but the government was taking preventive measures. A team from the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been dispatched to support with testing and outbreak control.",
      "South Sudan's health ministry on Sunday issued a public health advisory to residents of four counties to wash their hands frequently and avoid contact with bodily fluids to prevent the spread of the virus. Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya last week called the outbreak a concern because South Sudan has a \"fragile health system.\u201d",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Ecuadorians voted Sunday to strike down a proposal that would have let foreign countries run military bases in the South American country where drug gangs are extorting communities and killing politicians as they fight for territory.",
      "Another proposal rejected in the four-part referendum asked voters if they wanted to launch a process that could lead to a new constitution. Six out of 10 voters said no.",
      "It was a significant defeat for President Daniel Noboa, a conservative who is closely aligned with the Trump administration and had pushed Ecuador's courts to include the question about rewriting the constitution.",
      "Noboa said in an X message after the results were released that his government will \"respect the will of the people\" and would continue to fight for the country that \"everyone deserves.\u201d",

      "Voters were also asked if Ecuador should set up a constituent assembly, a legislative body that would be in charge of rewriting the nation\u2019s constitution, with Noboa arguing that a new constitution should seek tougher punishment for criminals and greater measures to control Ecuador\u2019s borders.",
      "Critics of the president said that a constitutional rewrite will not solve problems like insecurity and poor access to health and education services. And some feared that a new constitution would decrease legislative and judicial oversight of the executive branch.",
      "Voters were also asked if Ecuador should cut public funding for political parties, and if the number of legislators in the National Assembly should be reduced from 151 representatives to 73. Both measures were rejected by a wide margin.",
      "Noboa said these measures were necessary to cut excessive government spending, while his critics said they could limit political representation, especially in low-income communities where resources for political campaigns are scarce.",

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "Dietterich has some quibbles with certain companies using \u201cagentic\u201d to describe \u201cany action a computer might do, including just looking things up on the web,\u201d but he has no doubt that the technology has immense possibilities as AI systems are given the \u201cfreedom and responsibility\u201d to refine goals and respond to changing conditions as they work on people's behalf.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine a world in which there are thousands or millions of agents operating and they can form coalitions,\u201d Dietterich said. \u201cCan they form cartels? Would there be law enforcement (AI) agents?",
      "Milind Tambe has been researching AI agents that work together for three decades, since the first International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems gathered in San Francisco in 1995. Tambe said he's been \u201camused\u201d by the sudden popularity of \u201cagentic\u201d as an adjective. Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",
      "But computer scientists have been debating what an agent is for as long as Tambe has been studying them.",
      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",
      "\u201cWhen I see an article that talks about \u2018agentic\u2019 workflows, I\u2019m more likely to read it, since it\u2019s less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology,\u201d Ng wrote in a June 2024 blog post.",

More leaders will also speak from small island states and developing countries like Barbados and Bangladesh, both facing loss of land as seas rise because of climate change.",

      "\u201cWe are preparing to reinvigorate negotiations, and we have developed solutions that we will propose to our partners,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media, without providing details. \u201cDoing everything possible to bring the end of the war closer is Ukraine\u2019s top priority.\u201d",

      "Heavy new American sanctions on Russia\u2019s all-important oil industry, devised to push Putin to the negotiating table, are due to take effect on Friday. The sanctions against oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil seek to starve Putin\u2019s war machine of cash and halt its grinding war of attrition, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that \u201cthere will be no Russian representative in Turkey\" on Wednesday, although he insisted that Moscow is ready to negotiate.",
      "\u201cFor now, these contacts are taking place without Russian participation. We will await information on what would actually be discussed in Istanbul,\u201d Peskov said during his daily conference call with reporters.",
      "The sanctions also carry the threat of secondary penalties against anyone violating them, raising the stakes for Putin. China and India are major importers of Russian oil.",
      "Zelenskyy said that he would meet with senior officials in his government on Thursday, as well as with the leadership of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament and his political party, called Servant of the People.",

      "The deal would more than double FlyDubai's current fleet of aircraft and the airline said it had options to buy another 100 A321neos. It also represents a major purchase for the airline as Dubai prepares across both carriers to expand as it builds a five-runway airport in this desert sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The A321neo is a mid-range, two-engine, single-aisle aircraft, matching the style of the Boeing 737s that FlyDubai has relied on since launching flights back in 2009. The airline currently has a fleet of 95 aircraft.",
      "Airbus and FlyDubai declined to take questions from journalists at the announcement. Both firms referred to the order as a memorandum of understanding, signaling more negotiation are likely ahead before a firm deal.",

However, he said he believed Emirates\u2019 large purchase could see even President Donald Trump\u2019s White House take note and push the manufacturer to finish the plane.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure the White House will be leaning on Boeing to make sure it all works and they can get the things out of the doors quickly as they can, because it does mean jobs for everyone,\u201d Clark said. \u201cParticularly the 9X is going to be Seattle constructed, so all that sort of workforce in the northwest is almost secured now for decades.\u201d",
      "Boeing has faced billions in losses in recent years, as well as a slowdown in manufacturing off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, worker strikes and increased government scrutiny following two crashes of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019.

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Energy said Tuesday that it will loan $1 billion to help finance the restart of the nuclear power plant on Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island that is under contract to supply power to data centers for tech giant Microsoft.",
      "The loan is in line with the priorities of President Donald Trump's administration, including bolstering nuclear power and artificial intelligence.",
      "For Constellation Energy, which owns Three Mile Island's lone functioning nuclear power reactor, the federal loan will lower its financing cost to get the mothballed plant up and running again. The 835-megawatt reactor can power the equivalent of approximately 800,000 homes, the Department of Energy said.",
      "The reactor had been out of operation for five years when Constellation Energy announced last year that it would spend $1.6 billion to restart it under a 20-year agreement with Microsoft to buy the power for its data centers.",
      "Constellation Energy renamed the functioning unit the Crane Clean Energy Center as it works to restore equipment including the turbine, generator, main power transformer and cooling and control systems. It hopes to bring the plant back online in 2027.",
      "The loan is being issued under an existing $250 billion energy infrastructure program initially authorized by Congress in 2022. Neither the department nor Constellation released terms of the loan.",
      "The plant, on an island in the Susquehanna River just outside Harrisburg, was the site of the nation\u2019s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The accident destroyed one reactor, Unit 2, and left the plant with one functioning reactor, Unit 1.",

      "A new report says China funneled billions in hidden loans to U.S. companies over the past quarter century, some targeting industries key to national security",
      "WASHINGTON -- For years, Washington has been warning others not to trust loans from Chinese state banks fueling its rise as a superpower. But a new report reveals an ironic twist: The United States is the biggest recipient of all \u2014 by far. And the security and technology implications have yet to be fully understood.",
      "China\u2019s state lenders have funneled $200 billion into U.S. businesses for a quarter of a century, but many of the loans have been kept secret because the money was first routed through shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Delaware and elsewhere that helped obscure their origins, according to AidData, a research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.",
      "The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought \u2014 a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.",
      "\u201cChina was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,\u201d said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. \u201cWars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy.\"",
      "While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment \u2014 and President Donald Trump has courted it \u2014 money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy.",
      "Deals financed by China\u2019s state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China\u2019s strategic goals.",
      "In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets \u2014 rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.",
      "\u201cThe U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,\u201d said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \u201cThe irony is very rich.\u201d",
      "Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.",
      "\u201cThere is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,\u201d said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.",
      "Since the report\u2019s last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy.",
      "But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas \u2014 more than 100 in recent years \u2014 that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.",
      "\u201cIn places where there are more cops on the beat,\" Parks said, \u201cit has found ways to work around barriers to entry.\u201d",

      "Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.",
      "\u2014 In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs.",
      "U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.",
      "\u2014 That same year, the Chinese government published \u201cMade in China 2025,\" a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.",
      "After China\u2019s adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China\u2019s portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.",
      "\u2014 In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out.",
      "\u2014 And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.",
      "The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise.",
      "The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,\u201d said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we understand what they\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t make it easy.\u201d",

      "The Dubai Air Show has opened, with hometown airline Emirates ordering 65 Boeing 777-9 aircraft as the carrier looks to increase its fleets off record earnings and unending demand for flights through this East-West travel hub",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The biennial Dubai Air Show opened on Monday with hometown airline Emirates ordering 65 of Boeing's upcoming 777-9 aircraft, as the carrier looks to increase its fleets off record earnings and unending demand for flights through this East-West travel hub.",
      "Emirates valued the deal with Boeing and GE Engines at $38 billion at list prices, although airlines often negotiate lower prices in major orders.",
      "The announcement brings the total of Boeing 777-9s on order for Emirates to 270, making it Boeing's largest customer for the aircraft, even as the plane has suffered repeated delays in entering service. Emirates relies heavily on the double-decker Airbus A380 and the Boeing 777, and has also started flying the Airbus A350.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term commitment that supports hundreds of thousands of high-value factory jobs, and it reinforces our 40-year partnership with Boeing and GE,\u201d said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and chief executive of Emirates.",
      "\u201cEmirates is already the world\u2019s largest operator of the 777 \u2014 all powered by the GE engines \u2014 and after today's order, I expect to remain the biggest 777 operator for the years to come.\u201d",
      "Sheikh Ahmed added that Emirates continued to encourage manufacturers to build larger aircraft with more capacity as air travel is only expected to grow. However, he smiled and looked at Boeing when putting forward his hoped-for timeline for putting the 777-9 in service for Emirates.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to receiving delivery of our first 777-9s starting from the second quarter of 2027,\u201d he said.",
      "Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, offered no timeline for the plane's entry to service in her brief remarks.",
      "\u201cThe 777-9 will further support Emirates mission to connect people and places around the globe like never before,\u201d she said.",
      "The officials took no questions from journalists after the announcement.",
      "Meanwhile, Boeing announced a firm order of 11 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft by Ethiopian Airlines and Air C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoir made a firm order of four Embraer E175 aircraft. Air Senegal later ordered nine Boeing 787-8 MAX aircraft as well.",

Meanwhile, Israeli firms won't be attending over lingering anger from the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Emirates, the state-owned flagship airline of Dubai, earned annual profits of $5.2 billion in the last fiscal year and passenger numbers remain record-breaking at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel. The airline made a $52 billion purchase of Boeing Co. aircraft at the 2023 edition of the air show, which takes place at Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central.",
      "FlyDubai, the lower-cost sister to Emirates, also has seen record-breaking earnings, and likely wants to expand its fleet of single-aisle aircraft. The airline currently flies 95 Boeing 737 variants, with Airbus wanting to break into the carrier's fleet. FlyDubai ordered $11 billion worth of 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners at the last air show, which when delivered will be the airline's first wide-body aircraft.",
      "Al Maktoum airport itself is on the agenda for Dubai's government. It plans a $35 billion project to expand to five parallel runways and 400 aircraft gates, to be completed within the next decade. The airport now has just two runways, like Dubai International Airport. Those additional slots coming online will help Emirates and FlyDubai grow their network, and require more aircraft to fly those routes.",
      "Meanwhile, Rosoboronexport, Russia\u2019s main arms exporter, displayed its aircraft and weapons systems at a massive pavilion at the far end of the air show. The UAE has maintained economic ties and flights to Moscow despite the war on Ukraine and Western nations levying heavy sanctions on the country.",

      "A new analysis of consumer data shows that more people in the United States are falling behind on their utility bills",
      "WASHINGTON -- More people are falling behind on paying their bills to keep on the lights and heat their homes, according to a new analysis of consumer data \u2014 a warning sign for the U.S. economy and another political headache for President Donald Trump.",
      "Past due balances to utility companies jumped 9.7% annually to $789 between the April-June periods of 2024 and 2025, said The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. The increase has overlapped with a 12% jump in monthly energy bills during the same period.",
      "Consumers usually prioritize their utility bills along with their mortgages and auto debt, said Julie Margetta Morgan, the foundation's president. The increase in both energy costs and delinquencies may suggest that consumers are falling behind on other bills, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of information out there about rising utility costs, but here we can actually look at what that impact has been on families in terms of how they\u2019re falling behind,\" Margetta Morgan said.",
      "Troubles paying electricity and natural gas bills reflect something of an economic quandary for Trump, who is promoting the buildout of the artificial intelligence industry as a key part of an economic boom he has promised for America. But AI data centers are known for their massive use of electricity, and threaten to further increase utility bills for everyday Americans.",
      "These troubles also come as Trump faces political pressure from voters fed up with the high cost of living.",
      "Ever since Republicans saw their fortunes sag in off-year elections this month and affordability was identified as the top issue, Trump has been trying to convince the public that prices are falling. Fast-rising electricity bills could be an issue in some congressional battlegrounds in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Trump has put a particular emphasis on prices at the pump. Gasoline accounts for about 3% of the consumer price index, slightly less than the share belonging to electricity and natural gas bills \u2014 meaning that possible savings on gasoline could be more than offset by higher utility bills.",
      "The president maintains that any troubling data on inflation is false and that Democrats are simply trying to hurt his administration's reputation.",
      "\u201cIn fact, costs under the TRUMP ADMINISTRATION are tumbling down, helped greatly by gasoline and ENERGY,\" Trump posted on social media Friday. \"Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems,\u201d",

      "Both Margetta Morgan and Pierce previously worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency formed in part to track trends in household borrowing to prevent potential abuses. The Trump administration has essentially shut down the bureau.",
      "The administration has so far said it has no responsibility for any increases in electricity prices, since those are often regulated by state utility boards. The White House maintains that utility costs are higher in Democratic states that rely on renewable forms of energy.",
      "\u201cElectricity prices are a state problem,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News this month. \u201cThere are things that the federal government can control. Local electricity prices are not one of them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "By the end of next year, the state of Para is requiring all cattle to be tagged to trace where they came from in order to be sold legally",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Maria Gorete, who just began ranching three years ago, is doing something new with her 76 head of cattle in the Brazilian countryside near the town of Novo Repartimento.",
      "She's piercing their ears.",
      "Their new jewelry \u2014 ear tags, actually \u2014 will track their movements throughout their lives as part of an initiative aimed at slowing deforestation in the Brazilian state of Para. Depending on how well it works, it's the kind of solution the world needs more of to slow climate change, the subject of annual United Nations talks just a few hours away in Belem.",
      "With about 20 million cattle in Para, it's a mammoth task. Some of them are on big farms closer to cities, but others are in remote areas where farmers have been cutting down Amazon rainforest to make room for their pastures. That\u2019s a problem for climate change because it means trees that absorb pollution are being replaced by cattle that emit methane, a powerful planet-warming gas.",
      "Brazil has lost about 339,685 square kilometers (131,153 square miles) of mature rainforest since 2001 \u2014 an area roughly the size of Germany \u2014 and more than a third of that loss was in Para, according to Global Forest Watch. Para alone accounts for about 14% of all rainforest loss recorded worldwide over the last 24 years.",
      "Gorete, with her small herd, said the tagging hasn't been much of a hassle. And she sees the program as a good thing. It will let her sell her beef to companies and countries whose consumers want to know where it came from.",
      "\u201cWith this identification, it opens doors to the world,\u201d said Gorete, who before cattle ranching cultivated acai and cacao. \u201cIt adds value to the animals.\u201d",
      "Cows can move to several farms in their lifetime \u2014 born on one pasture, sold to a different farmer, or two or three or more, until they\u2019ve grown to their full weight and are sold to a processor, said Marina Piatto, executive director of the Brazilian agriculture and conservation NGO Imaflora.",
      "Tracking those movements effectively can be a way to discourage deforestation. That's where the tagging comes in.",
      "Starting next year, all cattle being transported in Para have to be tagged. Each animal actually gets a tag in each ear. One is a written number that is registered with the government in an official database. The other is an electronic chip that links to the same information as the number registered to the cow \u2014 like when and where it was born, where it was raised, the owner, the breed and more. By 2027, all cattle in Para, including cattle born on ranches in the state, have to have tags.",
      "Once a tag is removed, it\u2019s broken and can\u2019t be put back, a measure to help avoid fraud.",
      "When the cattle moves, owners are required to report those movements and buyers are required to log the transaction. To be able to sell their animals, ranchers must have tags and a clean history. Locations registered with the government where the animals have been can be checked against satellite images to detect illegal deforestation, or against maps that show Indigenous territories that are supposed to be off-limits for cattle.",
      "\u201cThe only solution is individual cattle traceability because then you can know for each movement where that cattle has been and if it has been in a place that has been deforested in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Otavio Passos, the Brazilian Amazon director with The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Mauro Lucio, 60, has 2,600 cattle on his farm in Paragominas about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Belem. He said the new tagging program was an easy transition for him because he's been tagging his cattle since 2000. He did it to track his own herd, but he sees the benefit of the government now being involved.",
      "\u201cFor me, this is the same tool,\" he said.",

      "JBS, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, is donating 2 million tags to the effort. The company, which is among several that have been fined or faced lawsuits for buying cattle raised illegally on deforested land, said traceability of cattle can help address concerns about deforestation. JBS says it has a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d for illegal deforestation and takes several steps to ensure its supply chain doesn\u2019t contribute to deforestation.",
      "Passos said it's important to have industry players on board. \u201cWe have never had such a unique window of opportunity where you have all the sectors, the cattle ranchers, the meatpackers, the industry, the government, the NGOs, all hurtling around the same objective,\u201d he said.",

      "Airlines can resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",

Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",

      "The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and pulled further from its all-time high  set late last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 557 points, or 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.8%.",
      "Nvidia was the heaviest weight on the market, as it\u2019s often been in its last couple of tumultuous weeks. The chip company fell 1.8%, while losses for other AI winners included a 6.4% slide for Super Micro Computer.",
      "Other areas of the market that had been high-momentum winners also sank. Bitcoin fell below $92,000, down from nearly $125,000 last month, for example. That helped drag down Coinbase Global by 7.1% and Robinhood Markets by 5.3%.",
      "Critics have been warning  that the U.S. stock market could be primed for a drop  because of how high prices have shot since April, leaving them looking too expensive. Critics point in particular to stocks swept up in the AI mania, which have been surging at spectacular speeds for years.",
      "Even with Monday\u2019s loss, Nvidia is still up 39% for the year so far after it doubled in price in four of the last five years.",
      "That has Wall Street\u2019s spotlight on Wednesday, when Nvidia will report how much profit it made during the summer. AI stocks have surged as much as they have because of expectations that they\u2019ll produce huge growth in profits. If they fail to top analysts\u2019 expectations, that would undercut one of the big assumptions that\u2019s driven the U.S. stock market to records.",

The company, which offers food and facilities management for schools, national parks and convention centers, also said it expects an underlying measure of profit to grow between 20% and 25% this upcoming year. While relatively strong, that was less than what analysts had been forecasting.",
      "That helped offset a rise of 3.1% for Alphabet. It jumped after Berkshire Hathaway said it built a $4.34 billion ownership stake in Google\u2019s parent company. Berkshire Hathaway, run by famed investor Warren Buffett, is notorious for trying to buy stocks only when they look like good values while avoiding anything that looks too expensive.",

      "Another source of potential disappointment for Wall Street is what the Federal Reserve  does with interest rates. The expectation had been that the Fed would keep cutting interest rates in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market. Wall Street loves lower rates because they can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments.",

      "Carolina (6-5) trails the Tampa Buccaneers (6-4) by a half-game in the NFC South, and the two teams will meet twice in the final three weeks.",
      "Both have tough road games in Week 12. The Panthers face the San Francisco 49ers (7-4) on Monday night. The Buccaneers take on the Los Angeles Rams (8-2) on Sunday night.",
      "Young bounced back from an ankle injury in the first quarter against Atlanta to lead a comeback from a 21-7 deficit a week after a disappointing 17-7 loss to New Orleans. If Young continues to play at this level, the Panthers could end Tampa Bay\u2019s streak of four consecutive division titles.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s just my expectation for Bryce to take every game plan and every opportunity and attack it, and he\u2019s been doing that,\u201d Panthers coach Dave Canales said. \u201d(Sunday) was a day about the whole group. It was about all the guys, the time on task, the side conversations in practices, working together in between drives and really just making it come alive. Finding the completions where they were and extending the play when he needed to. I\u2019m just proud of the way that he just pushed through for his teammates. It just speaks volumes to the type of leader that he\u2019s continued to grow into, and to be able to be available for his guys and find a bunch of different guys in different situations.\u201d",
      "Canales was two games into his first season as an NFL head coach when he decided to bench Young for veteran Andy Dalton. Young, the 2023 No. 1 draft pick, struggled in his rookie season under former coach Frank Reich. He needed more time to learn Canales\u2019 system, watch from the sideline and grow as a player. Canales helped develop Geno Smith in Seattle and Baker Mayfield in Tampa Bay. His patient approach with Young is coming along.",
      "Performances like the one against Atlanta should give Panthers fans reason for optimism that Young can still be a franchise QB.",
      "He has completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,962 yards, 14 touchdowns, seven interceptions and a career-high 86.0 passer rating.",
      "\u201cEverybody in the locker room knew it was bound to happen. We knew that we had in our bag, and specifically Bryce,\u201d rookie wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan said. \u201cBut I mean, to turn the tape on, man, Bryce went out there and balled for sure.\u201d",
      "The Detroit Lions may have found a formula to stop the tush push. They stopped Jalen Hurts five of six times on Philadelphia\u2019s version of the QB sneak. Two of the stops were negated by penalty. Still, the Lions had more success than any team against it. They also were one of the 10 teams to vote not to ban the play. None of the other nine teams will play the Eagles in the regular season.",

I was built for the chase and I was built to overcome the adversity to be able to persevere through something so heart-wrenching, no pun intended, but you know something so heart-wrenching and something so scary to life, to be able to get myself to a point where I wanted to be able to show that I can compete again at the highest level in the world. So, I think just the foundation that my parents built in me, the foundation of things I had to overcome and the mindset that I had to build myself up into a person carries me through life.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Venice has been charmed by a recent visitor: An acrobatic, wild dolphin. The feeling appears to be mutual \u2014 he so far refuses to leave \u2014 but proximity to humans has put him in danger.",
      "The dolphin nicknamed Mimmo has been delighting tourists and Venetians for months with his acrobatic flips. Experts are now eager to move him into open water, especially after verifying wounds indicating that the dolphin had been likely hit by a boat propeller.",
      "Multiple agencies used low-intensity acoustic devices to nudge Mimmo away from the heavily trafficked St. Mark\u2019s Basin on Saturday \u2014 and it worked briefly. But the dolphin came back within an hour, as experts feared he would.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying because it\u2019s a hot spot with lots of boat traffic,\u2019\u2019 said Guido Pietroluongo, a veterinarian at the University of Padua\u2019s emergency response team for stranded dolphins, whales and porpoises, known by the acronym CERT.",
      "St. Mark\u2019s Basin, the shallow expanse of water in front of St. Mark\u2019s Square connecting to both the Giudecca and Grand Canals, is heavily trafficked by ferries, vaporetti buses, water taxis, and private boats.",
      "During the failed operation, experts confirmed Mimmo had suffered superficial lesions, likely from a boat propeller, Pietroluongo said. It was the first time they had noted injuries to the dolphin, and his wounds are expected to fully heal. But experts are worried about his continued safety in such proximity to human activity.",
      "They don't plan any immediate action, and are hoping that colder seasonal temperatures will lure him, and his fish prey, out of the lagoon toward warmer waters, Pietroluongo said.",
      "Mimmo\u2019s arrival in the Venetian lagoon was registered on July 23, and experts say the coastal creature likely followed a school of fish into the brackish waters separated from the open sea by barrier islands. He was nicknamed for the sailing instructor who first spotted him off the Venetian lagoon fishing town of Chioggia.",
      "Mimmo follows the pattern of a so-called social loner, typically a young male dolphin that breaks away from the pod for food or for social reasons and then comes into contact with the human world, said Sandro Mazzariol, a CERT veterinarian.",

      "The most recent incident involved a pair of striped dolphins spotted in February 2021 that were quickly guided back to the open sea with acoustic devices. They never returned.",
      "Mimmo has been closely monitored during his lagoon sojourn, and has been reported in good health and nutrition as he feasts on a diet befitting any Venetian tourist: mullet, sea bass and sea bream. His behavior also has been deemed normal, including his playful aerial flips.",
      "The University of Padua team has been going out weekly to check on the animal, and they get regular updates from citizens who share sightings, including photos and videos.",
      "Authorities are warning citizens and boaters not to feed or interact with the dolphin, which is a criminal offense. Dolphins are protected under Italian, EU and international law. But the fact that Mimmo's fame is spreading is part of the problem.",
      "\u201cThe dolphin has become an attraction. Boats stopping to watch him can stress the animal,\u2019\u2019 Pietroluongo said.",

COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago later released a proposal with 21 options for negotiators to choose from on four sticky and interrelated issues.",
      "\u201cIt's text Tuesday and we\u2019re sort of off to the races,\u2019\u2019 said World Resources Institute's David Waskow, who said the nine-page proposal \u201caddresses some of the core questions that have been part of the presidency consultations.\u2019\u2019",
      "The four key political issues are whether countries should be told to do better on their new climate plans; details on handing out $300 billion in pledged climate aid; dealing with trade barriers over climate; and improving transparency, which Waskow said is really about reporting climate progress.",

      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks.

      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",

      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",
      "San Jose has reported strong early success in identifying potholes and road debris just by mounting cameras on a few street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",
      "PPL Electric Utilities, which delivers power to 1.5 million customers across central and eastern Pennsylvania, projects that data centers will more than triple its peak electricity demand by 2030.",
      "Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., told analysts on an earnings call this month that the data center projects \u201care real, they are coming fast and furious\u201d and that the \u201cnear-term risk of overbuilding generation simply does not exist.\u201d",
      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",
      "Still, PPL's projections helped spur a state lawmaker, Rep. Danilo Burgos, to introduce a bill to bolster the authority of state utility regulators to inspect how utilities assemble their energy demand forecasts.",
      "Ratepayers in Burgos' Philadelphia district just absorbed an increase in their electricity bills \u2014 attributed by the utility, PECO, to the rising cost of wholesale electricity in the mid-Atlantic grid driven primarily by data center demand.",
      "That's why ratepayers need more protection to ensure they are benefiting from the higher cost, Burgos said.",

      "Blue Origin has launched its huge New Glenn rocket with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Blue Origin launched its huge New Glenn rocket Thursday with a pair of NASA spacecraft destined for Mars.",
      "It was only the second flight of the rocket that Jeff Bezos\u2019 company and NASA are counting on to get people and supplies to the moon \u2014 and it was a complete success.",
      "The 321-foot (98-meter) New Glenn blasted into the afternoon sky from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending NASA\u2019s twin Mars orbiters on a drawn-out journey to the red planet. Liftoff was stalled four days by lousy local weather as well as solar storms strong enough to paint the skies with auroras as far south as Florida.",
      "In a remarkable first, Blue Origin recovered the booster following its separation from the upper stage and the Mars orbiters, an essential step to recycle and slash costs similar to SpaceX. Company employees cheered wildly as the booster landed upright on a barge 375 miles (600 kilometers) offshore. An ecstatic Bezos watched the action from Launch Control.",
      "\u201cNext stop, moon!\u201d employees chanted following the booster's bull's-eye landing. Twenty minutes later, the rocket's upper stage deployed the two Mars orbiters in space, the mission's main objective. Congratulations poured in from NASA officials as well as SpaceX's Elon Musk, whose booster landings are now routine.",
      "New Glenn\u2019s inaugural test flight in January delivered a prototype satellite to orbit, but failed to land the booster on its floating platform in the Atlantic.",
      "The identical Mars orbiters, named Escapade, will spend a year hanging out near Earth, stationing themselves 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away. Once Earth and Mars are properly aligned next fall, the duo will get a gravity assist from Earth to head to the red planet, arriving in 2027.",
      "Once around Mars, the spacecraft will map the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere and scattered magnetic fields, studying how these realms interact with the solar wind. The observations should shed light on the processes behind the escaping Martian atmosphere, helping to explain how the planet went from wet and warm to dry and dusty. Scientists will also learn how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment.",
      "\u201cWe really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\u201d Escapade\u2019s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. \u201cEscapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we\u2019re going to have two spacecraft at the same time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a relatively low-budget mission, coming in under $80 million, that's managed and operated by UC Berkeley. NASA saved money by signing up for one of New Glenn\u2019s early flights. The Mars orbiters should have blasted off last fall, but NASA passed up that ideal launch window \u2014 Earth and Mars line up for a quick transit just every two years \u2014 because of feared delays with Blue Origin's brand-new rocket.",
      "Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit the world, New Glenn is five times bigger than the New Shepard rockets sending wealthy clients to the edge of space from West Texas. Blue Origin plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on a demo mission in the coming months aboard New Glenn.",

      "Several lawsuits emerged across the U.S. \u2014 and were later consolidated \u2014 after AT&T notified millions of customers that information ranging from Social Security numbers to call records were compromised in these breaches last year. Plaintiffs alleged that the telecommunications giant \u201crepeatedly failed\u201d to protect consumer data. While AT&T has continued to deny wrongdoing, it opted to settle earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a Thursday statement, adding that the company remains \"committed to protecting our customers\u2019 data and ensuring their continued trust in us.\u201d",
      "Eligible consumers have until Dec. 18 to file for a settlement payment \u2014 which will still need a judge's final stamp of approval early next year. Here's what you should know.",
      "The settlement covers two different breaches. Both were disclosed in 2024 \u2014 but involve data belonging to millions of current and former AT&T customers dating as far back as 2019 or earlier.",
      "AT&T disclosed the first of these breaches in March 2024, after the company said it found that customer information from 2019 or earlier had been released on the \u201cdark web\" weeks earlier. At the time, AT&T said the breach impacted roughly 7.6 million current and 65.4 million former account holders \u2014 with leaked data including some sensitive info like Social Security numbers and passcodes.",
      "The other breach involved call and text records of nearly all AT&T customers from May through October of 2022, as well as a small subset from Jan. 2, 2023. AT&T said it learned that data was \u201cillegally downloaded from our workspace on a third-party cloud platform\u201d in April of last year \u2014 and began notifying customers in July 2024, after launching an investigation. The company maintained that the leaked records included information like phone numbers, but not content of the calls or texts, or other personally identifiable information.",

And those affected by the second breach may be eligible for up to $2,500. It's also possible to be an \u201coverlap settlement class member,\u201d which would mean you may be eligible for payments from both of these funds.",
      "Final payment amounts will vary depending on losses documented from each person \u2014 as well as the total number of claims received and added costs like attorney fees. And the court still has to give the settlement its final stamp of approval, in a hearing currently scheduled for Jan. 15, 2026.",

      "There's a new frontier in treating autoimmune diseases",
      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",
      "B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark \u201cbad\u201d B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.",
      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "A drug for Type 1 diabetes \u201cis forging the path,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.",
      "Type 1 diabetes develops gradually, and blood tests can spot people who are brewing it. A course of the drug teplizumab is approved to delay the first symptoms, modulating rogue T cells and prolonging insulin production.",
      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "That kind of result has researchers optimistic.",
      "\"We\u2019ve never been closer to getting to \u2014 and we don\u2019t like to say it \u2014 a potential cure,\u201d said Hopkins' Konig. \u201cI think the next 10 years will dramatically change our field forever.\u201d",

      "The contributions will be used to transform the SS United States into an artificial reef and finance a multi-year marketing campaign.

Recently, increased media attention has generated more calls to preserve the ship, and a group called the New York Coalition sued in Pensacola federal court asking a judge to halt sinking such a historically significant vessel.",

      "Marc Simmons hadn\u2019t heard from his estranged friend in nearly seven years. Then, Nigel Max Edge showed up at his work and falsely accused Simmons of stealing his identity.",
      "They met taking community college classes and bonded over their time with the Marines in Iraq. Simmons\u2019 kids once called Edge \u201cUncle Sean\u201d \u2014 back when his name was still Sean William DeBevoise.",
      "Simmons was now terrified his old friend would retaliate against him, he told a judge.",
      "\u201cThe defendant, Nigel Edge, is mentally unstable,\u201d Simmons said in a handwritten request for a protective order. \u201cAlways has a pistol on him, on high doses of medications that cause defendant to be anxious.\"",
      "That was back in May, four months before authorities say Edge, a former Marine sniper, guided a motorboat up to a crowded Cape Fear River bar in Southport, North Carolina, and opened fire with an AR-style rifle, killing three and wounding five.",
      "Edge, 41, is charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder and has been in jail without bond since the Sept. 27 shooting at the American Fish Company. A November hearing to determine next steps in the case was pushed to January.",
      "Prosecutors and Edge's attorney did not respond to questions about why the case was postponed.",
      "Following the shooting, police recovered two handguns and a short-barreled rifle from Edge\u2019s car and boat. At his home, they found two more rifles and pistols, including one with a silencer.",
      "Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said North Carolina needed to join the 21 states that have \u201cred flag laws,\u201d which allow authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from people deemed a threat. But there was another legal option.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether anyone petitioned a magistrate to involuntarily commit Edge to a psychiatric facility for evaluation because the records are not public. But anyone could have, not just close family and friends, said Mark F. Botts, a University of North Carolina School of Government associate professor.",
      "\u201cIt seems like he was estranged from the very people that would normally intervene,\" Botts said.",
      "Rachel Crowl feels there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around, from his family, to the government, even herself.",
      "\u201cWe failed him, as a whole,\" she said.",
      "Edge joined the Marines right after high school, eventually rising to the elite recon sniper corps. He was shot four times in 2006 on his second deployment to Iraq. The wounds led to his medical retirement in 2009.",
      "When he returned from Iraq, a large chunk of his skull missing and an insurgent\u2019s bullet still lodged in his brain, Marine Sgt. Sean DeBevoise \u2014 as he was then known \u2014 still seemed to have a firm grip on reality, Crowl said.",
      "Crowl, who fell in love at 14 with the blond, blue-eyed wrestler when he came to her New York middle school for a match, said his description of how he was wounded in Iraq matched his comrades' version of events; he loved his family, and they loved him.",

      "Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn\u2019t know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities haven\u2019t spoken about it.

Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning there seemed obvious.",
      "But why North Carolina and why was Charlotte the first target there?",
      "Sure the mayor is a Democrat, as is the governor, but neither is known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried hard to get along with the GOP-controlled state legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.",
      "But maybe focusing on a place where politics is less outwardly bloody was part of the equation.",
      "The White House \u201ccan have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version\" than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.",

Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested \u201cover 130 illegal aliens who have all broken\u201d immigration laws.

      "While the Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored \u201cdetainers,\u201d or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.",

      "That would make a slow-growing Anglican schism complete \u2014 if it happens.",
      "But how many church provinces go along with the rupture remains to be seen. Some of the communion\u2019s largest and fastest-growing churches in Africa belong to the conservative group that announced the break \u2014 known as the Global Anglican Future Conference, or Gafcon. But several member churches have been silent on the plan, weeks after it was announced.",
      "Gafcon's announcement came shortly after the October appointment of Bishop Sarah Mullally as the first woman to be archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Communion's symbolic spiritual leader. Many in England and other Western countries hailed this as a historic breaking of a stained-glass ceiling.",
      "But leaders of Gafcon criticized the appointment, as did some other bishops. Some said only men should be bishops, but their bigger criticism was her support for some LGBTQ+-inclusive policies \u2014 the key fault line in the communion.",
      "Within days of Mullally's appointment, Gafcon issued another declaration. It completely rejected the Anglican Communion as it has been structured historically. That structure has included a set of governing and advisory bodies and recognition of the archbishop of Canterbury as a symbolic \u201cfirst among equals\" among leaders of self-governing national churches, known as provinces. Since provinces are self-governing, the archbishop's authority is highly limited.",
      "The \u201dfuture has arrived,\u201d said Gafcon\u2019s chairman, Archbishop Laurent Mbanda of Rwanda, in its October statement. \u201cWe declare that the Anglican Communion will be reordered.\u201d His statement decried churches it said had violated a 1998 statement by the communion's bishops, opposing same-sex unions and describing \u201chomosexual practice as incompatible with Scripture.\u201d",
      "Gafcon proclaimed what it calls a restructured \u201cGlobal Anglican Communion.\u201d It would be overseen by a new council of top national bishops, or primates. Whoever is elected chairman would be \u201cfirst among equals.\u201d",
      "The question remains is: How many Gafcon members are actually going along with this plan, and how many want to remain in the existing Anglican Communion as a loyal opposition?",
      "Primates of Africa's two largest national provinces, Nigeria and Uganda, have joined their Rwandan counterpart in endorsing the measure, according to Bishop Paul Donison, Gafcon's general secretary. So have smaller churches ranging from Myanmar to the Americas.",
      "Nigeria Archbishop Henry Ndukuba confirmed his church's endorsement of Gafcon's plan. He called Mullally\u2019s stances on same-sex issues \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis election is a further confirmation that the global Anglican world could no longer accept the leadership of the Church of England and that of the Archbishop of Canterbury,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Donison said Gafcon's statement was drafted at a meeting in Australia, which included several church leaders on Zoom, though several others did not participate. Gafcon's statement said its bishops would \u201cconfer and celebrate\u201d restructuring at their next major meeting, scheduled this March in Nigeria.",
      "Among those signing on to the Gafcon statement is the conservative Anglican Church in North America, formed in a break from the more liberal U.S. and Canadian churches.",
      "The Gafcon move will \u201cmark a decisive moment in the life of the Anglican family,\u201d said ACNA Archbishop Stephen Wood, in a statement issued shortly before he took a leave of absence amid allegations of sexual and other misconduct, which he denies.",
      "The Anglican primate of Congo is committed to maintaining Anglican ties.",
      "In a statement, Archbishop Georges Titre Ande decried liberal trends in some churches but added: \u201cThe Anglican Church of Congo has no intention to leave the Anglican Communion, rather to keep working ... to reform, heal and revitalise the Anglican Communion without leaving it.\"",
      "The communion consists of churches descended from the Church of England. Anglicanism, with its unique mix of Protestant theology and Catholic-like ritual and sacraments, spread worldwide via colonial and missionary activity. It is especially vibrant in Africa. The London-based communion estimates it has about 85 million members across 165 countries.",
      "Simmering tensions in Anglicanism exploded after 2003, when the U.S. Episcopal Church ordained its first of several openly gay bishops. Conservatives formed Gafcon and other structures.

      "A new report says China funneled billions in hidden loans to U.S. companies over the past quarter century, some targeting industries key to national security",
      "WASHINGTON -- For years, Washington has been warning others not to trust loans from Chinese state banks fueling its rise as a superpower. But a new report reveals an ironic twist: The United States is the biggest recipient of all \u2014 by far. And the security and technology implications have yet to be fully understood.",
      "China\u2019s state lenders have funneled $200 billion into U.S. businesses for a quarter of a century, but many of the loans have been kept secret because the money was first routed through shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Delaware and elsewhere that helped obscure their origins, according to AidData, a research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia.",
      "More alarming, much of the lending was to help Chinese companies buy stakes in U.S. businesses, many tied to critical technology and national security, including a robotics maker, a semiconductor company and a biotech firm.",
      "The report found a far more widespread and sophisticated lending network than previously thought \u2014 a web of financial obligations extending beyond developing countries to rich ones, including the U.K., Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and other U.S. allies.",
      "\u201cChina was playing chess while the rest of us were playing checkers,\u201d said former White House investment adviser William Henagan, who worries the hidden lending has given China a chokehold on technologies. \u201cWars will be won or lost based on whether you can control products critical to running an economy.\"",
      "While the U.S. still welcomes most foreign investment \u2014 and President Donald Trump has courted it \u2014 money from China has drawn particular scrutiny as the world's two biggest economies with opposing ideologies battle for global supremacy.",
      "Deals financed by China\u2019s state-owned banks, the ones studied in the AidData report, are especially problematic. The lenders are controlled by China's central government and the Communist Party's Central Financial Commission, and they are directed to advance China\u2019s strategic goals.",
      "In total, the AidData report found China lent more than $2 trillion from 2000 through 2023 around the world, double the highest previous estimates and a surprise to even longtime analysts of China's rise. And much of the lending to wealthy countries was focused on critical minerals and high-tech assets \u2014 rare earths and semiconductors needed for fighter jets, submarines, radar systems, precision-guided missiles and telecom networks.",
      "\u201cThe U.S., under both (former President Joe) Biden and Trump, have been beating this drum for more than a decade that Beijing is a predatory lender,\u201d said Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. \u201cThe irony is very rich.\u201d",
      "Until now, a full accounting of China's state lending has never been published because much of the financing is buried beneath layers of secrecy, masked by Western-sounding shell companies and mislabeled by international databases as ordinary private financing.",
      "\u201cThere is a complete lack of transparency that speaks to the lengths to which China goes, whether through shell companies or confidentiality agreements or redactions, to make it extremely difficult to come up with this full picture,\u201d said Scott Nathan, the former head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency set up in the first Trump term to invest in foreign projects deemed in the U.S. national interest.",
      "Since the report\u2019s last documented loan in 2023, U.S. scrutiny has gotten better. Screening mechanisms, such as the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., got beefed up in 2020 to protect sensitive sectors in the economy.",
      "But China has gotten better, too, in part by setting up banks and branches overseas \u2014 more than 100 in recent years \u2014 that then lend to offshore entities, further clouding the origins of the money.",
      "\u201cIn places where there are more cops on the beat,\" Parks said, \u201cit has found ways to work around barriers to entry.\u201d",

      "Chinese state bank financing has touched projects across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, the West Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump has renamed the Gulf of America. Many loans targeted critical high-tech industries, according to the report.",
      "\u2014 In 2015, for instance, Chinese state-owned banks lent $1.2 billion to a private Chinese business to buy an 80% stake in Ironshore, a U.S. insurer whose clients included the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and undercover agents who might need help paying legal bills in case they got into trouble in their jobs.",
      "U.S. regulators were unaware of the Chinese government involvement because the financing was funneled through a Cayman Island business with no obvious ties to China, according to the report. U.S. officials later realized the Chinese government could access information and ordered the Chinese buyer to divest.",
      "\u2014 That same year, the Chinese government published \u201cMade in China 2025,\" a list of 10 high-tech areas, such as semiconductors, biotechnology and robotics, where it wanted to reach 70% self-sufficiency within a decade. The next year, in 2016, the Export\u2013Import Bank of China, a policy bank, provided $150 million in loans to help a Chinese company buy a robotics equipment company in Michigan.",
      "After China\u2019s adoption of the manufacturing master plan, the percentage of projects targeting sensitive sectors such as robotics, defense, quantum computing and biotechnology rose from 46% to 88% of China\u2019s portfolio for cross-border acquisition lending, according to AidData.",
      "\u2014 In 2017, a Delaware private equity firm using a Cayman Islands company tried to buy a U.S. chip maker; the deal was blocked when investigators discovered both companies were owned by a Chinese state-owned enterprise. That same Delaware company successfully bought a U.K. semiconductor maker that had to be divested when British authorities found out.",
      "\u2014 And in 2022, the U.K. forced a Chinese company to divest another sensitive British firm in the industry, a designer of chips in Apple phones but potentially adaptable for military systems. The Chinese company had bought it through a company in the Netherlands that they owned. That Dutch firm is now accused of withholding semiconductors vital to automakers in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "To trace China's hidden lending, AidData dug through regulatory filings, private contracts and stock exchange disclosures in more than 200 countries written in multiple languages.",
      "The effort to track China's state loans and investment started more than a decade ago when Beijing launched its Belt & Road Initiative to build infrastructure in developing countries. The project expanded sharply three years ago when the AidData team, which eventually grew to 140 researchers, realized many of the loans were landing in advanced economies such as the U.S., Australia, the Netherlands and Portugal, where acquisitions could allow it to access technology that Beijing considers essential to its global rise.",
      "The report says the findings show a shift in the use of state credit from promoting economic development and social welfare to gaining geo-economic advantages.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s global concern that this is part of a concerted effort to gain control over economic chokepoints and use this leverage,\u201d said Brad Setser, an adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we understand what they\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t make it easy.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is facing criticism for not condemning antisemitism within the conservative movement",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like someone, he knows how to show it. In just the last few days, he\u2019s described Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a traitor, mocked Rep. Thomas Massie\u2019s second marriage after his first wife died and demanded that comedian Seth Meyers get fired from his late-night television show.",
      "But he had nothing bad to say about two people roiling his party: white nationalist Nick Fuentes and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. The former Fox News host recently hosted Fuentes for a friendly interview, where he declined to challenge his guest's bigoted beliefs or a remark about problems with \u201corganized Jewry in America.\u201d",
      "Asked about the controversy that has been rippling through Republican circles for weeks, Trump did not criticize Fuentes and praised Carlson for having \u201csaid good things about me over the years.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s answer echoes his longstanding reluctance to disavow \u2014 and sometimes, his willingness to embrace \u2014 right-wing figures who have inched their way from the political fringe to the Republican mainstream.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed in President Trump,\u201d said Morton Klein, president of the conservative Zionist Organization of America, adding that he should \u201crethink and retract\u201d his comments.",
      "The threat of antisemitism, which has percolated across the political spectrum, will likely be a recurring political issue in the coming year, as Democrats and Republicans battle for control of Congress in the midterms. Although Trump has targeted left-wing campus activism as a hive of anti-Jewish sentiment, Fuentes' influence is a test of whether conservatives are willing to accommodate bigots as part of their political coalition.",
      "The turmoil has already engulfed the Heritage Foundation, a leading think tank whose president Kevin Roberts initially refused to distance himself from Carlson. A member of Heritage's board of trustees, Robert George, announced his resignation Monday, which followed a recent decision by an antisemitism task force to sever its ties with the organization.",
      "Although Roberts has apologized, George said \u201cwe reached an impasse\u201d because he didn't fully retract his original support for Carlson.",
      "\u201cI pray that Heritage\u2019s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is 'created equal' and \u2018endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,\u2019\" George wrote on Facebook, quoting the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Laurie Cardoza-Moore, an evangelical conservative activist and film producer, joined Heritage's antisemitism task force in June but stepped away when Roberts refused to resign.",
      "\u201cIf we aren\u2019t solid on condemning antisemitism, shame on us,\u201d she said Monday.",
      "Cardoza-Moore praised Trump's record on supporting Israel but said he fell short on Sunday while talking about Carlson and Fuentes.",
      "\"We can all agree \u2014 and I wish \u2014 that he would have gone further,\u201d she said.",
      "It's unclear what kind of pressure Trump will face despite his previous dalliance with Fuentes, who had dinner with the past-and-future president at his Mar-a-Lago club in between his two terms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump during his first or second term could be acting more strongly to prevent antisemitism,\u201d said Matthew Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. He noted Trump\u2019s first-term relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and, more recently, the president's handling of the war in Gaza.",
      "This is not the first time Trump has shied away from criticizing fringe elements on the right. During his first campaign for president, Trump initially declined to disavow support from white nationalist David Duke, saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d",

      "The U.S.-Saudi relationship had been sent into a tailspin by the operation targeting Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the kingdom, that U.S. intelligence agencies later determined Prince Mohammed likely directed the agents to carry out.",
      "But seven years later, the dark clouds over the relationship have been cleared away. And Trump has tightened his embrace of the 40-year-old crown prince he views as an indispensable player in shaping the Middle East in the decades to come. Prince Mohammed, for his part, denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident.",
      "Khashoggi will likely be an afterthought as the two leaders unveil billions of dollars in deals and huddle with aides to discuss the tricky path ahead in a volatile Middle East. They'll end their day with an evening White House soiree, organized by first lady Melania Trump, to honor the prince.",
      "\u201cThey have been a great ally,\u201d Trump said of the Saudis on the eve of the visit.",
      "Ahead of Prince Mohammed's arrival, Trump announced he has agreed to sell the Saudis F-35 fighter jets despite some concerns within the administration that the sale could lead to China gaining access to the U.S. technology behind the advanced weapon system.",
      "Trump's announcement is also surprising because some in the Republican administration have been wary about upsetting Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge over its neighbors, especially at a time when Trump is depending on Israeli support for the success of his Gaza peace plan.",
      "But the unexpected move comes at a moment when Trump is trying to nudge the Saudis toward normalizing relations with Israel.",

      "And getting Saudi Arabia \u2014 the largest Arab economy and the birthplace of Islam \u2014 to sign on would create an enormous domino effect, he argues. The president in recent weeks has even predicted that once Saudi Arabia signs on to the accords, \u201ceverybody\u201d in the Arab world \u201cgoes in.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think the challenge for us as Americans is to try to convince someone like MBS that the trajectory of Saudi Arabia ought to look more like South Korea than, say, China,\u201d said Bernard Haykel, a professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, speaking at a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace event on Monday. \u201cThat, ultimately, political repression of political dissent is not good for business.

      "A Tennessee judge has blocked the use of the National Guard in Memphis under a crime-fighting operation by President Donald Trump",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A Tennessee judge on Monday blocked the use of the National Guard in Memphis under a crime-fighting operation by President Donald Trump but also put the order on hold, giving the government five days to appeal.",
      "Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal's decision sides with Democratic state and local officials who sued, contending that Republican Gov. Bill Lee cannot deploy the Tennessee National Guard for civil unrest unless there is rebellion or invasion, and even then, it would require action by state lawmakers.",
      "The plaintiffs also said another provision spells out a need for a request from a local government to use the Guard in some scenarios, including a \u201cbreakdown of law and order,\u201d they said.",
      "Moskal agreed that the defendants have a likelihood of success in their lawsuit based on their claims that calling the National Guard into the city violates the state\u2019s military code and that they have shown \u201cthey are suffering or will suffer irreparable harm\u201d if the injunction isn\u2019t granted.",
      "But she also paused the order for at least five days so that the government has time to file an \u201cimmediate application for permission to appeal,\u201d without providing her reasoning for that timeline.",
      "The state has said Tennessee law gives the governor \u201cthe authority to dispatch the Guard when needed and to determine when that need exists.\"",
      "The judge concluded that the governor\u2019s power as commander-in-chief of the National Guard \u201cis not unfettered.\u201d",
      "In a statement posted on the social platform X, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, a plaintiff in the case, said he is pleased with the decision.",
      "\u201cThe injunction does not take effect immediately, and the state has a chance to seek leave to appeal,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, this is a positive step toward ensuring the rule of law applies to everyone, including everyday Tennesseans and even the Governor.\u201d",
      "Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward whose legal team is representing the plaintiffs, in a statement called the ruling \"a powerful affirmation that no one\u2014not a president, not a governor\u2014is above the law.\u201d",
      "Spokespeople for the governor\u2019s office and the state attorney general\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Monday.",
      "Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling neighborhoods and commercial areas of Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid in downtown, wearing camouflage and protective vests that say \u201cmilitary police,\u201d with guns in holsters. Officials have said Guard members have no arrest power.",
      "The Guard is part of a task force established by an order from Trump. It also involves a slew of other law enforcement agencies whose officers have patrolling the city now for weeks.",

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland officials have more than doubled the estimated cost to replace Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed and killed six construction workers last year after a massive container ship crashed into it, and they\u2019ve added two years on to the projected completion date.",
      "The Maryland Transportation Authority said Monday it is updating its financial forecast to include a price range of between $4.3 billion and $5.2 billion, with an anticipated open-to-traffic date in late 2030. That's up from a previous estimated cost of $1.9 billion and an opening date of late 2028.",
      "\u201cAs design has advanced and pre-construction work progresses, it became clear that material costs for all aspects of the project have increased drastically since the preliminary estimates were prepared less than two weeks after the initial tragedy,\u201d said Acting Transportation Secretary and MDTA Chair Samantha J. Biddle.",
      "The announcement by Maryland officials was made a day before the National Transportation Safety Board was scheduled to vote on its findings into what caused a massive container ship to crash into the bridge. The board was set to meet Tuesday morning in Washington to vote on a probable cause, safety recommendations and any changes to an earlier report.",
      "Investigators previously discovered a loose cable that could have caused electrical issues on the cargo ship called the Dali, which lost power and veered off course before striking the bridge, according to documents released last year by the NTSB.",

Although rebuilding will take longer than initially forecasted and cost more, we remain committed to rebuilding as safely, quickly and cost effectively as possible,\u201d Biddle said in a statement.",
      "Since the preliminary timeline and cost estimates were made shortly after the bridge collapsed, \"national economic conditions have deteriorated and material costs have increased,\u201d Gov.

      "Gary Walters saw a lot of history in a 37-year career at the White House",
      "WASHINGTON -- Gary Walters saw a lot of history in the 37 years he spent working at the White House, where he started as an officer assigned to protect the president and ended as the longest-serving chief usher in history.",
      "The position of chief usher is the top job in the residence, comparable to a general manager, overseeing maintenance, construction and renovation projects, and food service, along with administrative, financial and personnel functions. A staff of about 90 to 100 butlers, housekeepers, cooks, florists, electricians, engineers, plumbers and others report to the chief usher.",
      "It was Walters' job to run the White House on behalf of presidents and first ladies, because, as he says, \u201cThey\u2019ve got enough on their plate to deal with.\u201d",
      "He served under Democratic and Republican presidents \u201cand it had nothing to do with politics,\u201d Walters said Monday as he discussed his new book, out Dec. 5, called \u201cWhite House Memories 1970-2007: Recollections of the Longest-Serving Chief Usher.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe served the presidency,\u201d he said.",
      "Walters began his career as an officer in the Executive Protective Service with an assignment to help protect presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He joined the Usher\u2019s Office as an assistant in 1976 and, a decade later, was promoted to chief usher, serving Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Walters retired in 2007.",
      "Here are a few of the stories Walters shared at Monday's event.",
      "The White House had been getting ready for the annual Congressional Picnic the day of the Sept. 11 attacks. Staff were ordered to leave for their safety, but Walters and a half dozen others stayed behind.",
      "The South Lawn was set up with more than 160 tables for the event. Walters said he knew President George W. Bush \u2014 who had been at an event in Sarasota, Florida \u2014 would want to return to the White House, but the tables blocked the usual landing pad for Marine One, the presidential helicopter.",
      "So Walters and his remaining staff began to clear the lawn by hand, carrying some of the heavy tables to the perimeter to make room for Marine One to touch down.",
      "\u201cI just knew in my heart the president was going to talk\u201d to the American people after the attack, Walters said. Bush later delivered a prime-time, televised address to the nation from the Oval Office.",
      "As he and the staff worked, Walters said he heard the erroneous reports of an explosion at the State Department. Hearing a loud boom at another point, he looked toward the southwest and saw a plume of smoke and fire, from the plane that hit the Pentagon.",
      "They were told yet another plane was in the air. Walters said he believed it was bound for the White House, but it instead crashed into a Pennsylvania field after the passengers fought the hijackers.",

      "Maureen Reagan \u2014 one of President Reagan's daughters \u2014 gave out stuffed teddy bears at children's hospitals when she traveled abroad. When a shipment of bears didn't make it in time for one of her trips, Walters put it into storage.",

      "As Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan prepared to welcome guests to a dinner in the private upstairs quarters of the residence, Walters was horrified to see smoke coming from beneath the doors of the Yellow Oval Room. The fireplace there usually was lit to add to the ambience for the post-dinner entertainment.",

      "Asked if the flue had been opened, the butler told Walters, \u201cI thought it was open.\u201d",
      "Walters grabbed fire utensils to separate the burning logs and reached in and opened the flue. He also opened the door to the Truman Balcony and some windows to air out the room. He yelled down for the police officer stationed at the South Portico to move away as he threw the burning logs over the railing.",
      "Damp towels were put at the foot of the Yellow Oval Room doors to keep in the smoke, while fans were brought in along with air fresheners and scented candles.",
      "Walters then informed the Reagans of the mishap while the staff worked for hours \u2014 during cocktails and dinner \u2014 to clear the smoke.",

      "President Donald Trump isn't ruling out military action against Venezuela despite bringing up potential diplomatic talks with its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday did not rule out military action against Venezuela despite bringing up a potential diplomatic opening with leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has insisted that a U.S. military buildup and strikes on alleged drug boats near his South American country are designed to push him out of office.",
      "Trump reiterated that he \u201cprobably would talk to\u201d Maduro, but underscored that he is not taking off the table the possibility of military action on Venezuelan territory. Hours later, Maduro said he is open to dialogue with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t rule out that. I don\u2019t rule out anything,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office a day after he first floated the possibility of having \u201cdiscussions\u201d with Maduro. Trump, however, sidestepped questions about whether Maduro could say anything to him that would lead to the U.S. backing off its military show of force.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done tremendous damage to our country,\u201d said Trump, tying Maduro to drugs and migrants coming into the U.S. from Venezuela. \u201cHe has not been good to the United States, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "The comments from both leaders deepened the uncertainty about the Trump administration's next steps toward Maduro's government. The U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure in recent days, saying it was expecting to designate as a terrorist organization a cartel it says is led by Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan government officials.",
      "The USS Gerald R. Ford and accompanying warships arrived in the Caribbean this weekend just as the U.S. military announced its latest in a series of strikes against vessels suspected of transporting drugs.",
      "The administration says its actions are a counterdrug operation meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities, but some analysts, Venezuelans and the country\u2019s political opposition see them as an escalating pressure tactic against Maduro.",
      "The Trump administration has shown it \u201ccan turn policy on a dime,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, an expert on U.S. policy toward Venezuela who is a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He pointed to the diplomatic talks the administration held with Iran \u201cright up until the point\u201d that the U.S. military targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in June.",
      "But, Ramsey added, the timing of Trump\u2019s remarks \u2014 after Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s announcement of the impending terrorist designation of the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 underscores that the administration does not want to repeat failed attempts at dialogue.",
      "\u201cThey really want to negotiate from a place of strength, and I think the White House is laying out an ultimatum for Maduro,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cEither he engages in credible talks about a transition, or the U.S. will have no choice but to escalate.\u201d",
      "Maduro has negotiated with the U.S. and Venezuela's political opposition for several years, most notably in the two years before the July 2024 presidential election. Those negotiations resulted in agreements meant to pave the way for a free and democratic election, but Maduro repeatedly tested their limits, ultimately claiming victory despite credible evidence that he lost the contest by a 2-to-1 margin.",
      "Among the concessions the U.S. made to Maduro during negotiations was approval for oil giant Chevron Corp. to resume pumping and exporting Venezuelan oil. The corporation\u2019s activities in the South American country resulted in a financial lifeline for Maduro\u2019s government.",
      "During his weekly television show Monday, Maduro addressed Trump's comments, saying that \u201cfree countries and governments should only understand each other through diplomacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to engage in dialogue will find in us people of their word, decent people, and people with the experience to lead Venezuela,\u201d he said. Later, in English, he added: \u201cTalk, yes. Peace, yes. War, no. Never, never, war.\u201d",

      "Oakland Assistant Chief James Beere said the suspect went on campus for a \u201cspecific reason\u201d but did not elaborate. \u201cThis was a very targeted incident,\u201d he said at a Friday news conference.",
      "Beere did not say how the two men knew each other but said the Irving was known to hang around the Laney campus. Irving's brother told the San Francisco Chronicle that Irving had lost his job as a security guard after an altercation and was facing eviction at home.",
      "Beam joined Laney College in 2004 as a running backs coach and became head coach in 2012, winning two league titles. According to his biography on the college\u2019s website, at least 20 of his players went on to the NFL.",
      "His shooting came a day after a student was shot at Oakland\u2019s Skyline High School. The student is in stable condition. Beam had previously worked at Skyline High School, and the suspect in that shooting had played football there after Beam had already left for another job.",

    "summary": "Many fans of Taylor Swift showed parasocial relationships with the pop star after her engagement to Travis Kelce.",
    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",

      "YouTuber and social media influencer Jack Doherty was arrested for drug possession and other charges in Miami Beach after he was found disrupting traffic to allegedly film social media content, police said.",
      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "Later Saturday night, Doherty posted a TikTok video showing him bonding out of jail with the caption \"I got arrested last night and now I'm free.\"",
      "\"I'm a free man, baby,\" he said in the video, while holding the property bag that held his personal items at the time of his arrest. \"Let's go.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",

      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "In \"Defying Gravity: The Creative Career of Stephen Schwartz, from Godspell to Wicked\" (published by Applause Books), biographer Carol de Giere explores the life and work of the Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer of treasured Broadway and movie hits.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",
      "And don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Stephen Schwartz on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",
      "\"Defying Gravity\" by Carol de Giere",
      "Landing in Oz",
      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",
      "Do not grow oldno matter how long you live.Do not forget painbut somehow learn to forgive.",
      "The universe, it turns out, might be a bit absurd, but what an interesting ride!",

    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

    "story": [
      "The Vatican shared the spotlight with Hollywood on Saturday as Pope Leo XIV hosted dozens of stars, including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee and Monica Bellucci for a special audience celebrating the power of cinema.",
      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says AGS\u00a0can cause hives, nausea, stomach pain, breathing issues and swelling.",
      "Man died several hours after eating hamburger at barbecue",
      "According to researchers, a 47-year-old New Jersey man went on a camping trip with his wife and children in summer 2024, and after spending the day outdoors, they had beef steak for dinner. About four hours later, researchers say the man experienced severe abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting that lasted about two hours.",
      "The man apparently felt better the following morning, but when discussing what had happened with his family, he allegedly said, \"I thought I was going to die.\" However, he decided not to consult a doctor about the symptoms, researchers say.",

      "The man's death was ruled a \"sudden unexplained death,\" but his wife asked a friend in the medical field to review the autopsy report. The doctor contacted researchers in Virginia to look into the possible role of AGS.",
      "Earlier this year, the man's blood was tested, and researchers say it was determined he had suffered an allergic reaction to alpha-gal consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.",
      "The man's wife said that earlier in the summer, he had gotten about a dozen bug bites around his ankles believed to be from Lone Star tick larvae.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene an\u00a0ally during the shutdown for joining Democrats in demanding that Congress address high health care costs.",
    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

    "summary": "Facing pressure from states and families, Roblox will require players to use AI-powered technology that helps verify their age.",
    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "summary": "In some metro areas, child care expenses amount to more than double what families spend on rent, LendingTree found.",
    "story": [
      "As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis.",
      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents\u00a0one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Schulz pointed to what she described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",
      "\"What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:18:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Nov. 9 said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a\u00a0Truth Social post last week. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later\u00a0told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"\u00a0 That threshold is still in discussion, he added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "Speaking from the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said his administration plans on issuing dividends from tariffs \"probably in the middle of next year.\"\u00a0He said \"thousands of dollars\" would go to \"moderate income, middle income\" Americans, adding that his administration has taken in \"tremendous amounts of money\" from tariffs.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Nov. 9 told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending new tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-retirement-age-2026-change-66-67-increase/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

    "story": [
      "A growing share of lower-income Americans are struggling to get by financially as their wages fail to keep up with inflation, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Roughly 29% of lower-income households are living paycheck to paycheck, up slightly from 2024 and from 27.1% in 2023, data from the Bank of America Institute shows. The financial firm defines that as spending more than 95% of household income on necessities such as housing, gasoline, groceries, utility bills and internet service.",
      "In 2025, nearly a quarter of all U.S. households lived paycheck to paycheck, Bank of America estimates. Several factors explain why many people are falling behind.",
      "First, the nation's inflation rate this year has edged up to an annual rate of 3%\u00a0after dipping to 2.3% in April. The rise in consumer prices this year is well below their pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, but remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%.",
      "\"Inflation is picking back up again, and cost increases are picking back up again,\" said Joe Wadford, an economist at the Bank of America Institute, which recently\u00a0examined\u00a0the financial pressures facing Americans by income. \"That's definitely going to put some renewed pressure on those households.\"",
      "Second, the cost of groceries and other essentials is continuing to rise as lower-wage workers see their paychecks and purchasing power stagnate. In October, wages for lower-income households were up only 1% from a year ago, according to Bank of America deposit data.",
      "\"The gap between their wages and expenses has just continued to widen since the beginning of the year,\" Wadford said. \"When the cost of living is increasing 3% but your wages are only increasing 1%, you're just going to really struggle to keep up.\"",
      "Lower-wage workers experienced strong wage growth during the pandemic and subsequent economic recovery, but that rise has slowed sharply since late 2022, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. One factor weighing on wage growth \u2014 a decline in job openings and the rate at which workers are leaving their jobs.",
      "\"When people aren't looking for other offers or quitting, that is going to cause wage growth to slow,\" she said.",
      "In the trailing 12 months through October, higher-income millennial households have seen their average wages grow five percentage points faster than those of lower-income millennials, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "While lower-income households are struggling to scrape by, middle- and higher-income households are on firmer financial footing, buoyed by stronger wage growth. This group has seen little to no increase in the share of households living paycheck to paycheck, the Bank of America Institute found.",
      "\"These higher-income cohorts are more able to absorb the recent reacceleration in inflation due to their outsized wage growth,\" Wadford wrote in the report.",
      "That bifurcation is fueling what economists refer to as the \"K-shaped economy,\" a term experts use to describe the divergence in spending and financial health between wealthier Americans and people with more modest incomes.",
      "Gould also noted that many low-income Americans are unbanked and that Bank of America's findings, which are drawn from an analysis of its depositor data, may not fully capture the impact of slowing wage growth on poor households.",

      "The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker on Monday said the deal allows customers to browse local dealers' pre-owned Ford vehicle selections on Amazon Autos, and complete most paperwork online. Shoppers can then schedule a time to pick up their auto in person.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 140 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",
      "Wendy's shares rose 10 cents, or 1.1%, to $8.63 in early Tuesday trading, but remain down 46% for the year.",

      "Compared with the Thanksgiving holiday a year earlier, an additional 1.6 million people are predicted to travel more than 50 miles from their homes between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, the automobile group said. That would represent a new record for Turkey Day travel, which has rebounded since dipping to 56.8 million travelers in 2020, when the pandemic caused people to cancel their plans.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday it was lifting all restrictions on commercial flights that were imposed at 40 major airports during the country's longest government shutdown.",
      "Airlines were given permission to resume their regular flight schedules beginning Monday at 6 a.m. EST, the agency said.",
      "The announcement was made in a joint statement by Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford.",
      "Citing safety concerns as staffing shortages grew at air traffic control facilities during the shutdown, the FAA issued an unprecedented order to limit traffic in the skies. It had been in place since Nov. 7, affecting thousands of flights across the country.",
      "Impacted airports included large hubs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta.",
      "The flight cuts started at 4% and later grew to 6% before the FAA on Friday rolled the restrictions back to 3%, citing continued improvements in air traffic controller staffing since the record 43-day shutdown ended on Nov. 12.",
      "The number of flights canceled this weekend was at its lowest point since the order took effect and was well below the 3% cuts FAA was requiring for Saturday and Sunday. Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed that less than 1% of all flights were canceled this weekend. The flight tracking website FlightAware said 149 flights were cut Sunday and 315 were canceled on Saturday.",
      "The FAA statement said an agency safety team recommended the order be rescinded after \"detailed reviews of safety trends and the steady decline of staffing-trigger events in air traffic control facilities.\"",
      "The statement said the FAA \"is aware of reports of non-compliance by carriers over the course of the emergency order. The agency is reviewing and assessing enforcement options.\" It did not elaborate.",
      "Cancellations hit their highest point Nov. 9, when airlines cut more than 2,900 flights because of the FAA order, ongoing controller shortages and severe weather in parts of the country. Conditions began to improve throughout last week as more controllers returned to work amid news that Congress was close to a deal to end the shutdown. That progress also prompted the FAA to pause plans for further rate increases.",
      "The agency had initially aimed for a 10% reduction in flights. Duffy had said worrisome safety data showed the move was necessary to ease pressure on the aviation system and help manage worsening staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities as the shutdown entered its second month and flight disruptions began to pile up.",
      "Air traffic controllers were among the federal employees who had to continue working without pay throughout the shutdown. They missed two paychecks during the impasse.",
      "Duffy hasn't shared the specific safety data that prompted the cuts, but he cited reports during the shutdown of planes getting too close in the air, more runway incursions and pilot concerns about controllers' responses.",

    "summary": "Prediction markets, like Kalshi, which allow people to place wagers on everything from elections and sports to the anticipated bridesmaids at Taylor Swift's wedding, are booming. But this burgeoning business model is coming under scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.",
      "From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.",
      "\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said.",
      "That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\"",
      "The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.",
      "Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"",
      "Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\"",
      "Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"",
      "Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"",
      "Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.",
      "And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding.",
      "I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"",
      "Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"",
      "According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\"",
      "Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.",
      "In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture \u2013 it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"",
      "\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"",
      "But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. \u00a0The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" \u2013 and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket.",
      "Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"",
      "I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"",
      "\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"",
      "\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"",
      "\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether \u2013 \"",
      "\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said.",
      "\"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour.",
      "Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"",
      "Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"",
      "But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time.",
      "Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.",
      "\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 13:46:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Some businesses say steeper U.S. tariffs this year give them less financial room to offer holiday savings.",
    "story": [
      "Businesses face a tough decision this holiday season: Run a Black Friday promotion and see their profits drop, or charge full price and risk turning off buyers.",
      "Some business owners said sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports are raising their costs, giving them less room to roll out aggressive holiday sales.",
      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's planned immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans could start as early as Dec. 1, Department of Homeland Security sources told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The administration is planning to send roughly 200 federal Border Patrol agents to New Orleans, the next target of its far-reaching, nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News and reported on last week.",
      "The plans would make the Big Easy the latest Democratic-led city to be in the crosshairs of President Trump's mass deportation campaign, spearheaded in part by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents who have been directed to enforce that crackdown far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "This past week, Border Patrol agents led by controversial commander Gregory Bovino launched a series of immigration roundups in the Charlotte area. As of Tuesday morning, Border Patrol had recorded more than 200 arrests as part of that operation, which the Trump administration has dubbed \"Charlotte's Web,\" a DHS official familiar with the data told CBS News.",
      "A DHS official said Border Patrol's operation in Charlotte is expected to wind down this week.",
      "Previously, Bovino and teams of Border Patrol agents conducted sweeping immigration raids in Chicago and Los Angeles, arresting suspected unauthorized immigrants at Home Depot parking lots, worksites and other locations across those metropolitan areas.",
      "Border Patrol's operations in these Democratic-led cities have sparked protests and tense confrontations with local residents, and accusations that federal agents have been heavy-handed and have engaged in racial profiling.",
      "Trump administration officials have denied those claims, saying arrests are based on suspicions that individuals are in the U.S. illegally, not their race. It has also rejected criticism that federal agents' use of force has been excessive, citing attacks against law enforcement officials. Bovino told CBS News last month his agents' use of force in the Chicago operation had been \"exemplary.\"",
      "In the case of New Orleans, Border Patrol is setting its sights on a city with a Democratic mayor but a Republican governor. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry is an ally of Mr. Trump's who has worked with the administration on immigration enforcement.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",

      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",

Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",

      "Washington \u2014 More than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood alongside Democratic and GOP lawmakers and pressed Congress to look beyond politics, with the House set to vote Tuesday on a bill to release the government's remaining files related to the investigation of his crimes.",
      "\"This is one of the most horrific and disgusting corruption scandals in our country's history,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill. \"Because survivors spoke up, because of their courage, the truth is finally going to come out.\"",
      "At a news conference outside the Capitol, the accusers called for transparency and argued that releasing the files should transcend politics.",
      "Haley Robson said, \"It's time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side.\" \"This is not an issue of a few corrupt Democrats or a few corrupt Republicans, this is a case of institutional betrayal,\" said Annie Farmer. And Liz Stein said \"the Epstein files are not about loyalty to any one political party. They're evidence of a crime.\"",
      "\"In a divided nation, this is one demand we all share,\" said Lisa Phillips.",
      "The House vote, which is expected Tuesday afternoon, comes after four Republicans joined all\u00a0 Democrats to sign a petition to force a vote on the issue, circumventing House GOP leadership. Although President Trump initially expressed opposition to the release of the files and lashed out against Republicans who advocated for the release of the files, he changed his tune Sunday when it was evident the bill would pass. He urged House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files \"because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Another Epstein accuser, Jena-Lisa Jones, spoke of the emotionally \"distressing\" back-and-forth from the administration regarding the release of the files. She called on the president, whom she said she voted for, to \"show some real leadership,\" adding that his \"behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"",
      "\"I beg you, President Trump, please stop making this political,\" Jones said. \"It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it.\"",
      "Interest in the files has grown since July, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Since then, there's been widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Khanna outlined the widespread nature of the allegations from Epstein's accusers, saying, \"There should be no buildings named after people in this Epstein class, there should be no scholarships named after them, they shouldn't be enjoying the perks of being affiliated with corporations or universities or writing op-eds or being lionized.\" He added that \"many of the survivors will tell you, some of these people still are celebrated in our society.\"",
      "The California Democrat said the accusers \"are the ones who made today possible,\" adding that for decades, \"we have not done enough about this issue.\"",
      "Khanna also praised Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, whom he said have suffered \"extraordinary political consequences\" for their work on the issue.",
      "Massie thanked the women, saying they're \"giving everybody hope in this country.\"",
      "\"There are survivors of other sex crimes in this country wondering if they should come forward,\" Massie said. \"These survivors have stepped forth, taking that same risk, worried that they will be defamed themselves \u2014 they have been defamed for stepping forward \u2014 but we're going to get justice for them. That's going to happen today in the People's House.\"",
      "Greene praised the women for coming forward, saying, \"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight.\" She said they did so by fighting together \"against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today.\"",
      "The Georgia Republican noted she's been \"called a traitor\" by Mr. Trump in recent days in a public spat that seems to stem from the Epstein files.",
      "\"I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America first \u2014 and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" she said.",
      "\"Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries, and themselves.\" Greene said.",
      "\"Today you are going to see probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files,\" Greene said. \"But the real fight will happen after that.\"",
      "The \"real test\" will be whether the DOJ will release the files, or whether they will remain \"tied up in investigations,\" Greene said. She and Massie have raised the possibility that if the Justice Department opens investigations into Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, as Mr. Trump has suggested, they could be used to block the files' release.",
      "Massie said while \"they can try to protect a few certain people or a few certain companies, those investigations will eventually end.\" He added, \"They can't open enough investigations to cover up everything that's in these files.\"",
      "But if the bill passes in the House, it would next head to the Senate for approval, where Republican leaders have not said whether they'll bring it up for a vote. Massie appealed to the upper chamber in his remarks, asking the Senate not to derail the effort.",
      "\"If you do anything that prevents any disclosure, you are not for the people and you are not part of this effort,\" Massie said. \"Do not muck it up in the Senate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Tuesday passed a bill\u00a0in a near-unanimous vote that would compel the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Senate then approved it by unanimous consent, meaning it will soon head to President Trump's desk for a signature.",
      "The vote took place after House GOP leaders dragged out the process for months. The issue has disrupted committee meetings, stalled floor action on other legislation since this summer and fueled President Trump's tirades against some House Republicans, most recently GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. House Speaker Mike Johnson finally expedited a vote on the issue after more than half of all House members \u2014 including every Democrat and four Republicans \u2014 signed a petition forcing a vote.",
      "Mr. Trump suddenly reversed his opposition to the bill late Sunday after it appeared all but certain there would be mass Republican defections.",
      "Here's what to know about the process, what comes next, and how we got here.",
      "What the House's Epstein bill would do",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Information that falls under that umbrella includes investigative and prosecutorial materials related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as flight logs, travel records and materials about Epstein's detention and death. It also calls for the release of names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications about the case.",
      "It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates.",
      "What files does the DOJ have on Epstein?",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 or how many \u2014 records the Justice Department has in its possession, but Epstein and Maxwell have been the subject of multiple federal investigations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal and state officials in Florida in the 2000s, which ended with him pleading guilty to state-level prosecution charges. He was investigated again more than a decade later, leading to federal charges in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors.",
      "Maxwell was charged in 2020, and she is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "And Epstein's 2019 death by suicide in federal custody was probed by the Justice Department.",
      "Thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein, including emails, flight logs and other material, have already been released to the public by the House Oversight Committee and by a federal judge who oversaw the settlement of a lawsuit against Maxwell.",
      "Senate views on the bill",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, was noncommittal about bringing it up for a vote when asked in September. On Sunday, before Mr. Trump encouraged lawmakers to vote for the bill, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, expressed a similar sentiment.",
      "\"It'll come to the Senate. We'll take a look at it,\" he told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"But to me, this is not about truth. It's not about justice. This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame duck president. I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday that he would move to \"immediately\" take up and pass the bill, and said that if Thune \"tries to bury the bill, I'll stop him.\"",
      "Once it passed the House, Schumer called for Senate approval by unanimous consent, which it quickly received.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Monday he would sign the bill if it makes it to his desk.",
      "The president also has the power to order the Justice Department to release the files without action from Congress, but he has not indicated any plans to do so.",
      "Lawmakers push for Epstein files' release",
      "The bill's lead sponsors \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 have led the charge in the House for the documents' release. First, they introduced legislation that would force the Justice Department to make Epstein-related files public within 30 days, and they later used a procedural maneuver to bypass House leaders, who control what legislation hits the floor.",
      "The procedural maneuver, known as a discharge petition, secured the final signature needed to force a vote last Wednesday, when newly seated Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona added her name. Her swearing-in was delayed for seven weeks while the House was on an extended break during the shutdown.",
      "Instead of waiting until early December, when Johnson would be required to hold a vote on the issue under the rules governing the discharge petition process, the speaker is now seeking to move on sooner.",
      "\"It's a totally pointless exercise,\" Johnson said last week about why he was now choosing to accelerate the vote. \"It is completely moot now. We might as well just do it.\"",
      "Massie said Johnson's decision to drag out the vote for months \"caused nothing but political pain.\" Greene called Mr. Trump's previous opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "Johnson has repeatedly criticized the effort by Democrats and some Republicans to force a vote, saying their measure lacked enough protections for Epstein's victims. More recently, Johnson has touted the House Oversight Committee's investigation as sufficient.",
      "The Republican-led committee has so far released tens of thousands of documents from Epstein's estate and the Justice Department, as well as transcripts from interviews with former government officials about their handling of the case. The committee has also sought to depose Maxwell.",
      "The most recent release contained text messages and emails from Epstein in which he alluded to having dirt on Mr. Trump. In his correspondence with others, Epstein said of Mr. Trump, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" and referred to him as the \"dog that hasn't barked.\"",
      "\"You see, I know how dirty Donald is,\" Epstein wrote in an email chain discussing a 2018 New York Times opinion column on impeachment.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crimes related to the Epstein case. He and Epstein knew each other in New York and Palm Beach social circles in the 1990s and early 2000s, but Mr. Trump has said he cut ties years ago.",
      "Even Republicans who have supported making the Epstein materials public have defended Mr. Trump against criticism of his appearances in the files, arguing Democrats have cherry-picked details to damage the president.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Mr. Trump has accused Democrats of focusing on Epstein to deflect from the shutdown, which ended last week after 43 days. He also said he's ordering the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "But late Sunday, Mr. Trump ended his pressure campaign against the House bill, saying \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously lashed out at Republicans supportive of the efforts, calling them \"weak and ineffective.\" In recent days, he pulled his endorsement from Greene, who was once a close ally, bashing her as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Greene said the Epstein files \"sent him over the edge\" and alleged Mr. Trump had directed his ire at her \"to scare all the other Republicans\" from voting to make the materials public.",
      "\"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" she wrote on Friday.",
      "On Saturday, she added, \"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\"",
      "Massie pondered Sunday whether Mr. Trump's directive for the Justice Department to investigate Clinton and others was an attempt to block the files from becoming public.",
      "\"If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can't be released,\" Massie told ABC News' \"This Week.\" \"So this might be a big smoke screen \u2026 a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files.\"",
      "Trump administration's handling of Epstein files",
      "The Trump administration's handling of the Epstein materials has divided Mr. Trump's base.",
      "Some of those who believe that the federal government has concealed information about Epstein to protect powerful figures have been disappointed by his administration's disclosures so far.",
      "When right-wing influencers visited the White House in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi gave the group binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" But she faced criticism after the influencers said that the binders contained documents that had been public for years.",
      "Months later, a July memo from the Justice Department and FBI said they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" There was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, according to the memo, which also confirmed that Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail.",
      "Bondi had previously suggested a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk.",
      "After pressure from members of both parties, the Trump administration asked courts to unseal grand jury materials from the Epstein and Maxwell cases earlier this year, but those moves have been rejected by judges.",

    "story": [
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon told CBS News on Tuesday that federal money to support low-income students and special education will continue to flow as the Education Department shifts some of its grant programs to other agencies, amid the Trump administration's push to wind down the department altogether.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday\u00a0that the Department of Labor will now manage many of the Education Department's grants to elementary and secondary schools, including the Title I program, which hands out billions of dollars to aid schools with large numbers of low-income students.",
      "A handful of other shifts were also unveiled Tuesday. Certain higher education grants will be moved to the Department of Labor, the Department of the Interior will now handle Native American education grants, the State Department will run some international education programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services will take over a small child care grant program and a panel that reviews foreign medical schools.",
      "McMahon said the department has not decided how to handle some of its other major responsibilities, including its special education\u00a0grants and its Office for Civil Rights.",
      "But programs that support low-income students, students with special needs and civil rights will remain in place, even if they're moved to different agencies, McMahon told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "\"They will all still be done,\" McMahon said. \"They were done before there was a Department of Education, and they will continue to be done.\"",
      "\"Special education will not be abandoned,\" McMahon added.",
      "She said the Education Department will still oversee the programs that are being moved to other agencies, and their funding will come from the department's budget.",
      "McMahon said permanently moving the Education Department's responsibilities elsewhere would require congressional approval. But the department has argued that it does have the legal authority to essentially contract out some of its duties to other parts of the federal government.",
      "She referred to the moves as a \"pilot program\" and a \"proof of concept.\"",
      "\"I want to prove to Congress that these transfers of programs are more efficient and that they work,\" McMahon said. \"And so if we can do that, then hopefully ... we can get Congress to vote and to codify those transfers and make it a permanent move.\"",
      "President Trump has taken aim at the Education Department for months, signing an executive order in March directing the department to start closing itself down to the maximum extent required by law. The department has also moved to slash its workforce.",
      "The administration has argued that the Department of Education is overly bureaucratic and many of its tasks should be overseen by states and localities.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is fully committed to doing what's best for American students, which is why it's critical to shrink this bloated federal education bureaucracy while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Tuesday, adding that \"students and teachers don't need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms.\"",
      "Tuesday's moves drew pushback from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents thousands of Education Department staffers.",
      "\"Students, educators and families depend on the Department's comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs,\" the union said in a press release that called the changes \"unlawful\" and an \"insult\" to students. \"That national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.\"",

    "summary": "Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh, the mayor said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte.",
    "story": [
      "Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state's capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city, the state's largest.",
      "Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn't know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. At a city council meeting n Tuesday, she said there have been Border Patrol \"sightings\" in the county.",
      "\"Our law enforcement partners have confirmed that Border Patrol is in Wake County. So there have been several confirmed sightings \u2014 and Durham County,\" Cowell said. \"And we are just encouraging everyone if you feel unsafe or you see something that you think is illegal, to please call the Raleigh Police Department or your local jurisdiction, and to stay safe.\"",
      "Immigration authorities haven't spoken about it. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement: \"Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.\"",
      "Cowell, a Democrat, pointed out in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.",
      "\"I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,\" she said.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cowell added, \"While RPD is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that the Raleigh Police Department has not participated in any immigration planning activities.\"",
      "Democratic North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement\u00a0Monday night that his office \"is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.",
      "\"To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.\"",
      "The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic-leaning city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime \u2014 despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.",
      "McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers there had arrested \"over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken\" immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it didn't spell out how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.",
      "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools reported on student absences Monday. \"Unofficial attendance data from today indicates that approximately 20,935 students were absent from school today. This accounts for approximately 15% of students enrolled\" in that district, officials said. There was no word on the percentage of students who are absent on a typical day there.",
      "The immigration crackdown set off fierce objections from leaders in the Charlotte area.",
      "\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,\" Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. \"This is not making us safer. It's stoking fear and dividing our community.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was \"deeply concerned\" about videos she's seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters' peacefulness.",
      "\"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Charlotte area's place in immigration issue",
      "Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America's debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.",
      "The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he'd been arrested more than a dozen times.",
      "Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.",
      "Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.",
      "While the DHS has said it's focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored \"detainers,\" or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police don't help with immigration enforcement.",
      "In Mecklenburg County, the jail didn't honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.",
      "DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.",
      "For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.",
      "Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.",
      "While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law's requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.",
      "Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden's past inaction: \"They're stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.\"",
      "Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.",
      "\"I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,\" McFadden said in a statement.",
      "But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.",
      "\"Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,\" state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the only House member to vote against a bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The bill passed the House on Tuesday in a 427-1 vote after months of delay and pushback from GOP leaders, and then went on to win unanimous consent in the Senate. Despite the roadblocks, it achieved overwhelming Republican support to propel it to passage after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote, opening the door for nearly all GOP members to support it.",
      "In a post on X, Higgins explained his reasons for opposing the measure, saying the files could inadvertently entangle innocent people if they are released.",
      "\"I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people \u2014 witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.,\" Higgins wrote. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.\"",
      "His concerns echoed those expressed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and others, who argued that the legislative language needed to be changed to prevent the release of information that could compromise investigations or other sensitive material. The bill's supporters dismissed those concerns and said the bill includes provisions to block such disclosures.",
      "Higgins' statement continued: \"The Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case. That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans. If the Senate amends the bill to properly address [the] privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House.\"",
      "The bill requires the Justice Department to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, within 30 days of being signed into law. The legislation also requires the disclosure of \"[i]ndividuals, including government officials, named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity or plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings,\" as well as corporate, academic and governmental entities linked to him.",
      "The measure says that \"No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"",
      "The legislation allows the attorney general to withhold or redact documents that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files,\" as well as documents whose release would \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" It also excludes child sexual abuse material, information about ongoing criminal cases and material that could harm national security. Any redactions must be explained in notices to Congress.",
      "Shortly after the House vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated the upper chamber would take up the matter quickly.",
      "\"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen,\" the South Dakota Republican said.",

    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",
      "That document ended with a text the following day from Epstein to Bannon: \"If you are around the 18th, in dc. John Kerry,\" the former senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state.",
      "A spokesperson for Kerry told CBS News that he was back home in Boston after the end of his service in the Obama administration. \"He wasn't in Washington, DC, was never scheduled to be in Washington, and did not have a meeting or meeting request from that cast of characters, period, which isn't surprising since he didn't have a relationship with either one of them, and wasn't in contact with either of them,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "According to other messages sent from Epstein, he was planning another visit for the summer of 2019 to Saudi Arabia. That trip never happened due to his arrest and incarceration on federal sex crime charges.",
      "Other signs of the connections between Epstein and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have surfaced since his death. Authorities found a photograph of Epstein posing with bin Salman prominently displayed in his Manhattan mansion, according to The New York Times.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, officials also discovered that he held an expired Austrian passport from the 1980s with his picture and a false name, which listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.",

      "The Senate and House of Representatives passed \u2014 in rare bipartisan fashion \u2014 a bill that would require the Justice Department to release a trove of documents tied to investigations of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "President Trump's signature on the legislation would clear the way for the release of a new set of documents, including material not previously disclosed among the tens of thousands of pages released in batches from congressional investigators. Those disclosures have brought new focus on the former financier's global social circle of wealthy, powerful men.",
      "What Epstein files would be released, according to the bill?",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Combined, the documents would stem from a pair of federal investigations, in Florida and New York, spanning more than a decade.",
      "The two cases spawned widespread accusations of conspiratorial coverups, as it became clear that Epstein's jetsetting revolved around wining, dining and business deals with a wide cross section of world leaders and celebrities. Recent CBS News investigations have raised questions about the circumstances of Epstein's 2019 death in custody, and shown that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified following a 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida.",
      "The documents could include bank records, correspondence, witness interviews and communications or other files retrieved from Epsteins' electronic devices.",
      "New releases could reveal \"troublingly close relationships,\" though not necessarily more criminal conduct",
      "Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said a recent release of files might give a hint of what to expect. Last week, the House Oversight Committee published thousands of documents showing emails and text messages sent to and from Epstein \u2014 with Democrats on the committee highlighting emails in which Epstein suggested Mr. Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",
      "\"From a public interest perspective, the preview from House Dems last week suggests the files may reveal troublingly close relationships between Epstein and various notables,\" Richman said, but cautioned that he believes federal prosecutors in New York would have pursued any substantial leads with \"zeal.\"",
      "\"I would not be quick to assume any revelations when it comes to chargeable criminal conduct,\" Richman said.",
      "Former Epstein attorney David Schoen told CBS News he's concerned that the slow drip of file releases could harm the reputations of people who might have socialized or did business with Epstein, without involvement in his crimes. He pointed to an announcement Monday night by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that he's \"stepping back from public commitments\" as scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein builds.",
      "Summers said he was \"deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused.\" The correspondence that was published suggests Summers sought advice on women from Epstein: \"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\" There is no evidence of illegal conduct on Summers' part.",
      "Schoen said, \"My fear is that people's reputations will be tarnished now because their names appear even though they did nothing wrong.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he expects the Senate will amend the legislation to address what he called \"serious deficiencies\" related to survivors' privacy and the possibility of unintended disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI sought to address some of those concerns in an unsigned July memo, describing a review of the files, which it said contain \"images and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.\"",
      "The agencies wrote in their memo that \"while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein\u2026.no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "Richman said he didn't put much stock in the Justice Department's decisionmaking related to withholding documents related to Epstein.",
      "\"Such withholding might well be normal, but here, I worry that it will be used as a cover for a selectivity that helps Trump and his friends and hurts those he considers his enemies,\" said Richman. The Columbia Law School professor is a longtime friend of former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire who was indicted in September on two federal counts related to past testimony to Congress.",
      "FBI review revealed no Epstein client list",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi implied during a Fox News interview in February that an Epstein \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, in the July memo her agency and the FBI claimed, \"this systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
      "\"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,\" the July memo said.",
      "Actress Alicia Arden, who accused Epstein of sexual battery during a 1997 incident, said during a Monday press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred that it's a bipartisan issue, and asked,",
      "\"Why would there be a single 'No' vote?\"",
      "\"Vote to release these files so we can finally see who else helped Jeffrey Epstein,\" Arden said.",
      "New Epstein investigation could affect any release of files",
      "A recently announced investigation could complicate the matter.",
      "Bondi said on Friday that she had asked U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to open an investigation hours after Mr. Trump demanded a probe into several prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "It is unclear how that new investigation might impact efforts to release files related to Epstein's closed cases. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said Monday he worries that the new investigation could be used to block the release of some files. The Justice Department and Bondi have not commented further on Clayton's investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Massie, who led the effort to get the bill to the House floor, told reporters. \"I'm afraid they're going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they're subject of an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "During Arden's press conference Monday, attorney Gloria Allred echoed Massie's concern.",
      "\"So, now we're just involved in this political bloodbath trying to get answers. All I can say is when the fog of political war clears, I certainly hope that the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein will have more answers and information than they have now,\" Allred said.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district, and the legislation was signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states that are redoing their maps. In Texas, a federal court\u00a0blocked the state\u00a0from using the newly redrawn map in the upcoming midterm elections. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create Missouri's new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The proposed maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans. The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly redrawn congressional map in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, a setback for Republicans as they work to maintain their narrow majority in the House.",
      "In a decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court\u00a0ordered the state to instead use House district lines adopted by the Texas legislature in 2021 for next year's congressional elections. The dispute was heard by a three-judge panel, which divided 2-1 in finding that voting rights and advocacy groups that challenged the redistricting plan were likely to prove that the 2025 map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The court found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the decision will be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences \u2013 and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"",
      "Still, the ruling marks an early blow for Republicans and Mr. Trump, who had urged Texas state lawmakers to engage in a mid-decade redrawing of their House map in order to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in the lower chamber.",
      "\"A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement. \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing.\"",
      "The map approved by the Texas legislature, which was signed by Abbott in August, redraws the state's congressional districts to create five GOP-friendly seats. The effort in Texas kicked off a redistricting battle that has expanded to other states. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, pushed to recraft his state's voting boundaries, and voters there approved a ballot measure earlier this month to draw new congressional districts. The map unveiled by California Democrats shifts five of the state's House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.",
      "In both Missouri and North Carolina, state GOP lawmakers have approved new maps that target a single Democratic-held district in each state. But the battles over House district lines have also sparked court fights that seek to block the updated maps from taking effect.",
      "Under the original lines adopted by Texas' GOP-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open. Those voting lines enacted in 2021 were used in the 2022 and 2024 House elections.",
      "But with the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and Republicans at risk of losing their hold on the lower chamber, Mr. Trump's political team began pushing Texas GOP leaders earlier this year to explore redrawing the state's congressional map. That effort picked up steam after the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter in July alleging that some of the districts in the 2021 map were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "The letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, threatened legal action if Texas didn't dismantle and re-configure four Democratic-held congressional districts, which she said were unconstitutional.",
      "Abbott then added redistricting to the agenda for a special session of the state legislature and directed state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map to address the Justice Department's concerns. The new redistricting plan, signed by Abbott in August, creates five new districts that are favorable to Republicans.",
      "Soon after the map received the green-light from state Republicans, a coalition of advocacy groups moved to block the state from using it in the upcoming House elections. The plaintiffs argued that Texas lawmakers engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander when redrawing the lines, while the state said it relied exclusively on politics, not race, during the latest redistricting process.",
      "The federal court in El Paso held a nine-day trial last month to address the claims and found that the nonprofit organizations were likely to prevail on their racial-gerrymandering claims.",
      "Brown wrote in his decision that the Justice Department, in its July letter, directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering when it ordered the state to rectify districts that it deemed problematic. The court said the Justice Department's letter effectively imposed a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when drawing congressional district lines.",
      "Brown also pointed to Abbott's actions in response to the letter, including his decision to add redistricting to the legislative agenda for the special session and his public statements.",
      "\"The Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race. In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts,\" Brown wrote in his 160-page decision evaluating the redrawn map. \"The legislature adopted those racial objectives.\"",
      "The court said that supporters of the new redistricting plan also made numerous statements that suggested they retooled the district lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.",
      "The judges also rejected any concerns that it is blocking the new map too close to the election. Courts typically avoid ordering late changes election rules to protect against voter confusion and disruption. But Brown wrote that if the new House districts can remain in place, voters will be forced to vote under a map that likely sorts them on the basis of race, depriving them of their right to participate in a \"free and fair election.\"",
      "Additionally, because the candidate-filing deadline is Dec. 8, the court said that the 2026 congressional election is not yet underway.",
      "\"To allow legislatures to redistrict as close to elections as possible while limiting the courts' ability to review the constitutionality of that action \u2014 even in extraordinary cases like this one\u2014 would unduly tip the balance of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches and impair the effectiveness of the Constitution's protections of voting rights,\" Brown wrote for the court.",

    "summary": "The NIH cuts affected over 115 clinical trials studying cancer and nearly 100 studying infectious disease, researchers found.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 1 in 30 clinical trials were interrupted by funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, affecting more than 74,000 patients and research into cancer, infectious disease and more, according to a newly published paper.",
      "Clinical trials are the best way for researchers to study how medical interventions affect a patient population, doctors say.",
      "\"The types of trials that are affected are among the most rigorous way that we generate scientific evidence: randomized clinical trials,\" said Dr. Anupam B. Jena, a study author and professor at Harvard Medical School. \"It would be one thing if studies affected by terminated grants focused on less rigorous or important forms of research, but clinical trials are important, gold-standard in terms of evidence generation, time-intensive, and costly. Those are the last types of studies we would want to stop mid-stream.\"",
      "The paper, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 383 clinical trials were interrupted by the funding cuts, which Jena said was \"surprisingly high\" to the research team. To calculate that number, the researchers looked at all clinical trials that received NIH funding between Feb. 28, 2025, the day of the first reported grant termination, and Aug. 15, 2025. There were about 11,008 clinical trials funded by NIH grants during that time period.",
      "More than 36% of the interrupted trials have since been completed. Another 35% were recruiting patients. About 11% of the trials were active and not recruiting patients, while 14% were active but not yet recruiting. The remaining trials were enrolling patients by invitation. Trials that had their funding interrupted had more expected participants enrolled than trials that were not affected, the researchers found.",
      "Trials that were active and not recruiting, where participants may have been receiving interventions, had a total of 74,311 patients enrolled in them, the researchers said.",
      "The researchers looked at the trial details to learn more about what kind of research was being interrupted. Trials conducted outside the U.S. were disproportionately affected, and within the United States, the Northeast had the highest rate of interrupted trials. More than 115 trials studying cancer were interrupted, as well as 97 trials that looked at infectious diseases. Trials studying cardiovascular diseases, mental health and reproductive health were also affected.",
      "Jena warned that the interruptions could lead to \"avoidable waste\" and \"impact the future willingness of patients to participate in trials.\"",
      "Jena said there is no systemic data on how often clinical trials are paused for funding lapses. Termination of federal grant funding was \"exceedingly rare\" before 2025, he said.",
      "\"Clinical trials aren't light switches,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, an editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"You can't just flip them off without consequences. Cutting off funding mid-trial wastes research dollars and puts patients at risk. This is a breach of trust with every person who volunteers for research.\"",
      "The NIH said it strongly rejected the \"intentionally misleading portrayal of our grant management process\" in the letter and accused the researchers of having conflicts of interest, though it did not specify what those were. The NIH highlighted the \"more than 42,500 active, recruiting, or planned clinical trials across every major disease area\" that it currently funds and oversees, and said the paper had a \"selective focus on a handful of appropriately paused studies.\"",
      "\"What they fail to mention is that NIH is undergoing a strategic realignment. We are prioritizing high-impact, high-urgency science ... The biomedical research enterprise is being refocused and that's what will keep America at the forefront of global science, safety, and innovation,\" the NIH said. The agency also said the terminated or interrupted studies \"likely happened because this research prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people.\"",
      "The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research. More than $2 billion in federal research grants were canceled by the NIH earlier this year as part of President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to downsize the federal government. Agency spending has also been slowed, and 1,300 employees have been fired. Thousands of universities and U.S. institutions rely on NIH funding for their research.",
      "Former NIH head Dr. Francis Collins, who led the agency for 12 years across three administrations, told CBS News in April that \"every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year.\"",
      "\"When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, 'I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.' Those are people's lives at risk,\" Collins told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The bill aims to impose restrictions on ballroom donors seeking to influence the administration.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to put guardrails around private donations to fund construction on White House grounds and the vice president's residence.",
      "The bill, which comes in response to President Trump soliciting private money to fund a $300 million East Wing ballroom, is sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.",
      "The bill aims to impose restrictions on donors seeking to influence the administration in power and would require transparency. It would prohibit the president from soliciting donations, ban the display of donor names, bar donors from remaining anonymous and institute a two-year \"cooling-off period\" in which donors would be prohibited from lobbying the government.",
      "The bill, called \"Stop Ballroom Bribery Act,\" would also prevent donations from businesses or individuals with business before the government \u2014 including those facing federal litigation or enforcement actions.",
      "Several firms that donated to the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project have pending business before the government, like mergers requiring Justice Department approval or federal contracts hanging in the balance.",
      "\"Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether President Trump is building a ballroom to facilitate a pay-to-play scheme for political favor,\" Warren said.",
      "With Republican majorities in both chambers, the bill faces long odds. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "\"President Trump has put a 'for sale' sign on the White House\u2014soliciting hundreds of millions of dollars from special interests to fund his $300 million vanity project. Our measure is a direct response to Trump's ballroom boondoggle,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment on the bill. In the Oval Office Tuesday, President Trump said the new, larger ballroom would be useful to host more guests at official dinners \u2014 like the one Tuesday night in honor of the Saudi crown prince. He said people were excluded from the event due to space limitations.",
      "In late October and early November, Blumenthal sent letters to more than 40 individuals, foundations and companies that supported the White House ballroom. Blumenthal sought answers about how much firms like Amazon and Comcast had poured into the project and whether they had the option to remain anonymous.",
      "So far, just 16 donors have replied. Their responses mention corporate civic pride and compliance with federal law, but offer few details about their financial contributions or substantive answers to the senator's questions, according to congressional sources.",
      "Microsoft was a bit more forthcoming than most. It said it was contacted by a fundraiser about making a donation in late September, according to the congressional source. The tech giant was given information about how to donate and an invitation to a dinner for supporters.",
      "That dinner was held in the White House's East Room on Oct.\u00a015. Several Microsoft executives were on the guest list, according to CBS News sources.",
      "Amazon said it started talking to fundraisers in August, not long after the project was announced, according to the congressional source. Amazon vice president of public policy Brian Huseman was the company's representative at the October dinner, sources said.",
      "NVIDIA told Blumenthal that it requested that the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit collecting donations, notify NVIDIA before making public statements about the company, according to the congressional source.",
      "Among those who replied to Blumenthal are Amazon, Apple, The Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, Booz Allen, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, HP, Meta, Micron Technology, Microsoft, NVIDIA, The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Foundation, Reynolds, Ripple and T-Mobile.",
      "None of the firms or foundations specified how much money they contributed to the cause.",
      "Blumenthal is the top Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the investigative arm of the Senate's Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.",
      "Without a subpoena, firms and individual donors are not compelled to provide detailed answers to Blumenthal's questions. Responses are entirely voluntary.",
      "Congressional Democrats have written at least nine letters seeking more information about the ballroom.",
      "Jennifer  Jacobs\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement. \"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.\"",
      "Dozens of messages between Summers and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "The emails show Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "In one March 2019 exchange, the pair appeared to banter about a woman that Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer advice to the Harvard professor.",
      "\"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\"",
      "In a separate conversation, Epstein appears to call himself Summers' \"wing man.\"",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "It's not clear what public commitments Summers will call off. An economist by training, he has remained a professor at Harvard University since stepping down as the Ivy League school's president in 2006. He currently teaches two classes at the Harvard Kennedy School on globalization and U.S. economic policy, according to the school's course catalog.",
      "A former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration, Summers is an influential voice on economic policy. He advised former President Barack Obama during the financial crisis, and he publicly tangled with the Biden administration over its approach to post-COVID-19 economic stimulus.",
      "Epstein's ties with Harvard were well known. The late financier donated upward of $9 million to the university prior to his 2008 guilty plea in Florida, Harvard found in a 2020 investigation. The school said it didn't accept donations from Epstein after that, but he continued to engage with faculty and visit the school dozens of times",
      "CBS News has reached out to Harvard for comment.",
      "President Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats. A spokesperson for former President Clinton said he wasn't aware of Epstein's actions and didn't do anything wrong.",
      "Mr. Trump's own relationship with Epstein has also drawn intense scrutiny. The two men traveled in the same Manhattan and Palm Beach social circles for a period of time, but Mr. Trump says he cut ties many years ago. The president hasn't been charged with a crime or been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Epstein regularly brought up Mr. Trump in the emails that were released last week. In one correspondence, Epstein said of the president, \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referring to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "Cartel de los Soles is not known to be a traditional, hierarchical drug cartel like the Sinaloa or Tren de Aragua The term is instead generally used to describe a loose, decentralized network of military and government officials within the Venezuelan state who are alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade.",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 19:28:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.N. Security Council has approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the Palestinian territory.",
    "story": [
      "The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote. The U.S. and other countries had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power on the United Nations' most powerful body to block the resolution's adoption.",
      "The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future following two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that Security Council authorization was essential for their participation.",
      "The ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, but accusations of violations of the terms by both Hamas and Israel had threatened to upend the deal in the weeks since its implementation.",
      "The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to release all living and deceased hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. While the living hostages were returned by the deadline, the remains of some of the dead hostages had not been handed over \u2014 with both Hamas and U.S. officials citing the difficulties in recovering some of the remains amid the destruction in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said constituted a violation.",
      "There have also been flare-ups of violence in Gaza, including airstrikes from Israel, which it said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces, since the deal went into effect. International advocates have also accused Israel of not adhering to the requirement to deliver all of the aid it promised to Gaza in the deal.",
      "The U.S. resolution endorses President Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan, which calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Mr. Trump would head. It also authorizes the stabilization force and gives it a wide mandate, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expires at the end of 2027.",
      "\"Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media following the U.N. vote. He thanked the members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, and said, \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",
      "During nearly two weeks of negotiations on the U.S. resolution, Arab nations and the Palestinians had pressed the United States to strengthen the original weak language about Palestinian self-determination.",
      "The U.S. revised it to say that after the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which now governs parts of the West Bank \u2014 makes reforms and after redevelopment of the devastated Gaza Strip advances, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds.",
      "That language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel's borders.",
      "A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and Muslim nations pushing for a ceasefire and potentially contributing to the international force. The U.S. mission to the U.N. distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal.",
      "The vote took place amid hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire would be maintained after a war set off by Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's more than two-year offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.",
      "Russia last week suddenly circulated a rival proposal with stronger language supporting a Palestinian state alongside Israel and stressed that the West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.",
      "It also stripped out references to the transitional board and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide options for an international force to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire plan, stressing the importance of a Security Council role.",
      "The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question is how to disarm Hamas, which has not fully accepted that step.",
      "It authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.",
      "The resolution says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel.",
      "As the international force establishes control and brings stability, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\" These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says.",

      "The bipartisan legislation calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021. The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days of the legislation's passage. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is leaving his post, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Monday. Richardson submitted his resignation Monday morning, according to five current and former homeland security officials familiar with the decision.",
      "He served as FEMA's \"Senior Official Performing the Duties\" of administrator since May 8, 2025, when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem abruptly removed his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton. Before leading FEMA, Richardson was Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security's Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.",
      "FEMA chief of staff Karen Evans will step into his role starting Dec. 1, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said.",
      "From the outset, Richardson's leadership style garnered attention. In his first all-hands meeting he told agency staff: \"Don't get in my way \u2026 I will run right over you,\" and declared, \"I and I alone speak for FEMA.\"",
      "In a statement, a DHS spokesperson expressed their \"appreciation\" to Richardson and wished him \"continued success in his return to the private sector,\" and outlined some of the things he oversaw in his short tenure at the helm of FEMA.",
      "Richardson's resignation comes amid mounting criticism over FEMA's response to the devastating Ccentral Texas floods in July, which claimed more than 130 lives, including 27 campers and counselors at Camp Mystic on the Guadalupe River. Richardson was sharply criticized \u2013 including by lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2013 for being inaccessible during the crisis, with FEMA officials telling CBS News that the acting administrator was unreachable for hours, complicating efforts to deploy search-and-rescue teams.",
      "At a congressional hearing in July, Richardson defended FEMA's performance as a \"model\" of disaster response, disputing reports of delayed deployments and unanswered calls. He also denied there were lapses in contracts for FEMA's disaster help line.",
      "In one widely reported gaffe, Richardson also told colleagues he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season \u2014 comments sources say raised serious concerns among seasoned emergency managers.",
      "Critics\u2014including current and former FEMA employees\u2014have also pointed to bureaucratic bottlenecks under Noem's leadership, including a directive that any expenditure over $100,000 require the DHS secretary's personal sign-off.",
      "Richardson's resignation lands at roughly the same time that the FEMA Review Council is expected to deliver a sweeping report to the president, outlining recommendations to restructure and reshape the agency. The council's work was ordered by the White House to conduct a comprehensive assessment of FEMA's performance during the Biden administration and deliver a formal report to the president in November. President Trump has repeatedly signaled that FEMA \"should be eliminated as it exists,\" with Noem directing the council not merely to evaluate the agency but to fundamentally \"reimagine\" it.",

    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",

The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",

      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "In an update on Nov. 13, Google said its request for a temporary restraining order \"was granted just hours after the complaint was filed, and the Lighthouse operation is now essentially dark.\"",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "A Gustav Klimt portrait painting sold Tuesday for $236 million, a record for a modern art piece, at an auction where a solid gold, fully functional toilet satirizing the ultrarich also fetched $12.1 million.",
      "The toilet, by Maurizio Cattelan \u2014 the provocative Italian artist known for taping a banana to a wall \u2014 went up for auction Tuesday evening at Sotheby's in New York. The starting bid for the 223-pound, 18-karat-gold work was about $10 million.",
      "Cattelan has said the piece, titled \"America,\" satirizes superwealth.",
      "\"Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,\" he once said. Sotheby's, for its part, calls the commode an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value.\"",
      "Klimt's \"Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer\" sold earlier in the night after a 20-minute bidding war, also becoming the most expensive work of art ever sold by Sotheby's worldwide. The piece attracted bids from at least six collectors before finally selling.",
      "The portrait was one of the few by the Austrian artist that survived World War II intact. It depicts the young daughter of one of Klimt's patrons and was kept separate from his other paintings that were burned in a fire at an Austrian castle.",
      "The piece was part of the collection of billionaire Leonard A. Lauder, heir to cosmetics giant The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. He died earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, a portrait of a young woman by Klimt that was long believed to be lost was sold at an auction in Vienna for $32 million. The painting, \"Portrait of Fr\u00e4ulein Lieser,\" was one of Klimt's last pieces of work before he died in 1918.",
      "Klimt worked mainly in Vienna in the early 1900s and he may be best known for \"The Kiss.\"",
      "The toilet, which had been owned by an unnamed collector, was one of two that Cattelan created in 2016. The other one was displayed in 2016 at New York's Guggenheim Museum, which pointedly offered to lend it to President Trump when he asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting. Then the piece was stolen while on display in England at Blenheim Palace, the country manor where Winston Churchill was born.",
      "Two men were convicted in the toilet heist, but it's unclear what they did with the loo. Investigators aren't privy to its whereabouts but believe it probably was broken up and melted down.",

      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",

    "story": [
      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told President Trump Tuesday that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will increase its investments of $600 billion in the U.S. to near $1 trillion.",
      "The new figure was raised by the president during bin Salman's White House visit.",
      "\"I want to thank you because you've agreed to invest $600 billion into the United States, and because he's my friend, he might make it a trillion, but I'm going to have to work on him,\" Mr. Trump said during their Oval Office meeting.",
      "Bin Salman, who goes by MBS, agreed that the figure would be close to $1 trillion.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, the president touted $450 billion in Saudi investments in the U.S., but an economic analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute found that exports of American goods and services to Saudi Arabia from 2017 to 2020 totaled just a fifth of that, around $92 billion.",
      "A May 2017 defense agreement with the kingdom worth around $110 billion was supposed to take effect immediately, the White House said at the time. But according to records kept by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees foreign military sales, the Defense Department formally notified Congress of roughly $23 billion in possible arms sales to Saudi Arabia between 2017 and 2020.",
      "Bin Salman's trip to the White House marks his first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.\u00a0Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 60 Minutes interview in 2019 that he took responsibility for Khashoggi's death, because his murder had been \"committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "MBS was asked about Khashoggi in the Oval Office Tuesday. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" he said.",
      "President Trump also said during the Oval Office meeting that \"a lot of people didn't like that gentleman [Khashoggi]\" and added that \"he [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump welcomed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, to the White House with an elaborate military display Tuesday, praising the crown prince and insisting the U.S.-Saudi relationship has never been better as the two countries look to sign major business and national security deals.",
      "The pomp and circumstance \u2014 and the president's praise and warmth toward MBS \u2014 were more typical of a visit from an allied Western democracy than an absolute monarchy with a troubled human rights record, pointing to the president's focus on economic and business ties above virtually all else. The White House sees Saudi Arabia as a critical security partner in a turbulent Middle East, as well as an economic partner.",
      "The White House arrival ceremony for the crown prince on Tuesday morning was laden with fanfare, complete with a U.S. military flyover, cannons, horses, and a red carpet. American and Saudi flags adorned the White House South Lawn, and a military band greeted the Saudi royal. Mr. Trump and the crown prince exchanged greetings as they shook hands, and then watched the formation of F-35 and F-16 fighter jets fly by before going inside the White House.",
      "The crown prince's meeting with the president concluded and MBS departed the White House Tuesday afternoon, though he returned later in the evening for a black-tie dinner in his honor. Guests spotted at the dinner included Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi team Al-Nassr.",
      "Ahead of bin Salman's arrival, Mr. Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0Monday that the U.S. would sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudis. In the Oval Office, MBS said the Saudis will increase a planned investment of $600 billion in the U.S. to closer to $1 trillion, an announcement that pleased Mr. Trump greatly.",
      "Mr. Trump praised the crown prince in the Oval Office, calling him a \"very good friend\" and insisting his record on human rights is commendable, despite the State Department's long list of concerns of human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Arbitrary and unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, serious restrictions on freedom of expression and restrictions on religious freedom continue to plague the nation, according to the latest 2024 State Department report.",
      "The trip to the White House is the crown prince's first U.S. visit since Washington Post journalist and human rights activist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in 2018 in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul by members of the Saudi government. The president has smoothed over relations with the Saudis since the CIA assessed about a month after Khashoggi's killing, during Mr. Trump's first term, that the crown prince had\u00a0ordered it.",
      "Bin Salman has denied any involvement, but he\u00a0told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell\u00a0in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview, \"I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.\"",
      "The Biden administration later released the Trump-era intelligence report concluding the crown prince \"approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\"",
      "Bin Salman was asked about Khashoggi directly in the Oval Office Tuesday, giving U.S. reporters a rare chance to question the future king. \"About the journalist, it's really painful to hear that anyone losing his life for no real purpose,\" MBS said.",
      "The crown prince sought to distance the Saudi government from the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, as families of the attacks criticize the White House for inviting him. Bin Salman said he feels \"painful about families of 9/11 in America,\" but claimed Osama bin Laden used the Saudi people to \"destroy\" the American-Saudi relationship. Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years, drawing\u00a0vehement denials\u00a0from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized members of the media for some of the questions.",
      "\"We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today and a friend of mine for a long time, a very good friend of mine,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm very proud of the job, what he's done is incredible in terms of human rights and everything else.\"",
      "Later in the day Tuesday, the crown prince attended a dinner at the White House. There are 120 invited guests, according to a person familiar with the planning, and 30 will be from the Saudi delegation.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday evening's dinner is a perfect example of why his large ballroom under construction is necessary. Although it's not a state dinner, it is the first formal dinner hosted by Mr. Trump in his second term to honor a nation's leader. Bin Salman's father, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is technically the head of state of the kingdom, but he delegated his duties as ruler to MBS in 2017.",
      "\"We're more than meeting,\" Mr. Trump said Friday of the visit. \"We're honoring Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy, defense sales and the fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge, which was announced during the president's trip to Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "Mr. Trump is also planning to attend a Saudi business summit in Washington, D.C., Wednesday. An invitation previously obtained by CBS News said the event at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the U.S.-Saudi Business Council.",
      "Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and former top White House adviser Jared Kushner have fostered close relationships with the Saudis and the crown prince in particular, viewing them as critical partners for both security and business in a turbulent Middle East. The president said the Abraham Accords \u2014 an agreement from his first term that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel, Bahrain and the UAE\u00a0 \u2014 would be a big topic of discussion during the visit.",
      "\"The Abraham Accords will be a part we're going to be discussing,\" Mr. Trump said over the weekend. \"I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abraham Accords since we put Iran out of business.\"",
      "Mr. Trump recently told \"60 Minutes\" contributing correspondent Norah O'Donnell that he thought bin Salman would join the agreement, although the Saudis have indicated that would not happen without a path to Palestinian statehood.",
      "The Trumps also have extensive and longheld personal business ties in Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "And Kushner started a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received a reported $2 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund controlled by bin Salman.",
      "Asked about the potential conflicts of interest given his family business ties, Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday,\"I have nothing to do with the family business.\"",
      "\"They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually, I'm sure they could do a lot,\" Mr. Trump said of his family.",
      "Criticism of human rights record",
      "Following the killing of Khashoggi, Mr. Trump did not seek to punish bin Salman personally during his first administration and said he viewed Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally,\" noting the economic ties between the U.S. and the Saudis. The Trump administration did sanction 19 Saudi nationals over the killing.",
      "\"Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Mr. Trump posted on social media in November 2018.",
      "\"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi. In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\"",
      "Human rights advocates are dismayed about the treatment bin Salman is expected to receive in Washington, not only because of Khashoggi's murder, but also because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record under bin Salman.",
      "\"We know President Trump won't ask MBS to reveal where Jamal's remains are so his family can finally bury him,\" said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now, an organization Khashoggi founded months before he was killed. \"But the least he can do \u2014 the absolute minimum \u2014 is publicly press MBS to release the dozens of activists, writers and reformers languishing in Saudi prisons for the 'crime' of speaking freely.\"",
      "Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director at DAWN, called bin Salman's journey from castigation over Khashoggi's murder to a high-profile White House welcome an \"extraordinary political feat.\" And that's not just because of Mr. Trump's gestures of friendship toward the crown prince. Whitson mentioned the \"fist bump seen around the world,\" as former President Joe Biden warmly greeted Khashoggi in Riyadh during his presidency \"hat in hand.\"",
      "\"We went from the Biden administration narrowly sanctioning Mohamamd bin Salman himself for the murder of Khashoggi \u2026 to now welcoming him into Washington and not only sort of feting him for whatever lucrative deals he can pass to American businesses, but also to potentially actually help as a stabilizing force,\" Whitson said.",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Washington \u2014 More than a dozen of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers stood alongside Democratic and GOP lawmakers and pressed Congress to look beyond politics, with the House set to vote Tuesday on a bill to release the government's remaining files related to the investigation of his crimes.",
      "\"This is one of the most horrific and disgusting corruption scandals in our country's history,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sponsored the bill. \"Because survivors spoke up, because of their courage, the truth is finally going to come out.\"",
      "At a news conference outside the Capitol, the accusers called for transparency and argued that releasing the files should transcend politics.",
      "Haley Robson said, \"It's time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side.\" \"This is not an issue of a few corrupt Democrats or a few corrupt Republicans, this is a case of institutional betrayal,\" said Annie Farmer. And Liz Stein said \"the Epstein files are not about loyalty to any one political party. They're evidence of a crime.\"",
      "\"In a divided nation, this is one demand we all share,\" said Lisa Phillips.",
      "The House vote, which is expected Tuesday afternoon, comes after four Republicans joined all\u00a0 Democrats to sign a petition to force a vote on the issue, circumventing House GOP leadership. Although President Trump initially expressed opposition to the release of the files and lashed out against Republicans who advocated for the release of the files, he changed his tune Sunday when it was evident the bill would pass. He urged House Republicans to vote to release the Epstein files \"because we have nothing to hide.\"",
      "Another Epstein accuser, Jena-Lisa Jones, spoke of the emotionally \"distressing\" back-and-forth from the administration regarding the release of the files. She called on the president, whom she said she voted for, to \"show some real leadership,\" adding that his \"behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"",
      "\"I beg you, President Trump, please stop making this political,\" Jones said. \"It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it.\"",
      "Interest in the files has grown since July, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. Since then, there's been widespread calls for greater transparency from the Trump administration.",
      "Khanna outlined the widespread nature of the allegations from Epstein's accusers, saying, \"There should be no buildings named after people in this Epstein class, there should be no scholarships named after them, they shouldn't be enjoying the perks of being affiliated with corporations or universities or writing op-eds or being lionized.\" He added that \"many of the survivors will tell you, some of these people still are celebrated in our society.\"",
      "The California Democrat said the accusers \"are the ones who made today possible,\" adding that for decades, \"we have not done enough about this issue.\"",
      "Khanna also praised Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, whom he said have suffered \"extraordinary political consequences\" for their work on the issue.",
      "Massie thanked the women, saying they're \"giving everybody hope in this country.\"",
      "\"There are survivors of other sex crimes in this country wondering if they should come forward,\" Massie said. \"These survivors have stepped forth, taking that same risk, worried that they will be defamed themselves \u2014 they have been defamed for stepping forward \u2014 but we're going to get justice for them. That's going to happen today in the People's House.\"",
      "Greene praised the women for coming forward, saying, \"These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight.\" She said they did so by fighting together \"against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today.\"",
      "The Georgia Republican noted she's been \"called a traitor\" by Mr. Trump in recent days in a public spat that seems to stem from the Epstein files.",
      "\"I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America first \u2014 and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" she said.",
      "\"Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries, and themselves.\" Greene said.",
      "\"Today you are going to see probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files,\" Greene said. \"But the real fight will happen after that.\"",
      "The \"real test\" will be whether the DOJ will release the files, or whether they will remain \"tied up in investigations,\" Greene said. She and Massie have raised the possibility that if the Justice Department opens investigations into Epstein's relationships with prominent Democrats, as Mr. Trump has suggested, they could be used to block the files' release.",
      "Massie said while \"they can try to protect a few certain people or a few certain companies, those investigations will eventually end.\" He added, \"They can't open enough investigations to cover up everything that's in these files.\"",
      "But if the bill passes in the House, it would next head to the Senate for approval, where Republican leaders have not said whether they'll bring it up for a vote. Massie appealed to the upper chamber in his remarks, asking the Senate not to derail the effort.",
      "\"If you do anything that prevents any disclosure, you are not for the people and you are not part of this effort,\" Massie said. \"Do not muck it up in the Senate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana was the only House member to vote against a bill that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The bill passed the House on Tuesday in a 427-1 vote after months of delay and pushback from GOP leaders, and then went on to win unanimous consent in the Senate. Despite the roadblocks, it achieved overwhelming Republican support to propel it to passage after President Trump dropped his opposition to a vote, opening the door for nearly all GOP members to support it.",
      "In a post on X, Higgins explained his reasons for opposing the measure, saying the files could inadvertently entangle innocent people if they are released.",
      "\"I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today. It abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America. As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people \u2014 witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.,\" Higgins wrote. \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote.\"",
      "His concerns echoed those expressed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and others, who argued that the legislative language needed to be changed to prevent the release of information that could compromise investigations or other sensitive material. The bill's supporters dismissed those concerns and said the bill includes provisions to block such disclosures.",
      "Higgins' statement continued: \"The Oversight Committee is conducting a thorough investigation that has already released well over 60,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case. That effort will continue in a manner that provides all due protections for innocent Americans. If the Senate amends the bill to properly address [the] privacy of victims and other Americans, who are named but not criminally implicated, then I will vote for that bill when it comes back to the House.\"",
      "The bill requires the Justice Department to release \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" regarding Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, within 30 days of being signed into law. The legislation also requires the disclosure of \"[i]ndividuals, including government officials, named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities, civil settlements, immunity or plea agreements, or investigatory proceedings,\" as well as corporate, academic and governmental entities linked to him.",
      "The measure says that \"No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"",
      "The legislation allows the attorney general to withhold or redact documents that \"contain personally identifiable information of victims or victims' personal and medical files,\" as well as documents whose release would \"constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" It also excludes child sexual abuse material, information about ongoing criminal cases and material that could harm national security. Any redactions must be explained in notices to Congress.",
      "Shortly after the House vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated the upper chamber would take up the matter quickly.",
      "\"I think there are some things he'd like to change, but you got a 427 to 1 vote, it's probably not likely to happen,\" the South Dakota Republican said.",

    "summary": "If President Trump signs the bill passed by the House and Senate requiring DOJ to release documents tied to investigations of Jeffrey Epstein, here's what could be published.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate and House of Representatives passed \u2014 in rare bipartisan fashion \u2014 a bill that would require the Justice Department to release a trove of documents tied to investigations of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "President Trump's signature on the legislation would clear the way for the release of a new set of documents, including material not previously disclosed among the tens of thousands of pages released in batches from congressional investigators. Those disclosures have brought new focus on the former financier's global social circle of wealthy, powerful men.",
      "What Epstein files would be released, according to the bill?",
      "The bill would require the attorney general to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices within 30 days of becoming law.",
      "Combined, the documents would stem from a pair of federal investigations, in Florida and New York, spanning more than a decade.",
      "The two cases spawned widespread accusations of conspiratorial coverups, as it became clear that Epstein's jetsetting revolved around wining, dining and business deals with a wide cross section of world leaders and celebrities. Recent CBS News investigations have raised questions about the circumstances of Epstein's 2019 death in custody, and shown that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest, even as sex trafficking accusations intensified following a 2008 \"sweetheart deal\" with prosecutors in Florida.",
      "The documents could include bank records, correspondence, witness interviews and communications or other files retrieved from Epsteins' electronic devices.",
      "New releases could reveal \"troublingly close relationships,\" though not necessarily more criminal conduct",
      "Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said a recent release of files might give a hint of what to expect. Last week, the House Oversight Committee published thousands of documents showing emails and text messages sent to and from Epstein \u2014 with Democrats on the committee highlighting emails in which Epstein suggested Mr. Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",
      "\"From a public interest perspective, the preview from House Dems last week suggests the files may reveal troublingly close relationships between Epstein and various notables,\" Richman said, but cautioned that he believes federal prosecutors in New York would have pursued any substantial leads with \"zeal.\"",
      "\"I would not be quick to assume any revelations when it comes to chargeable criminal conduct,\" Richman said.",
      "Former Epstein attorney David Schoen told CBS News he's concerned that the slow drip of file releases could harm the reputations of people who might have socialized or did business with Epstein, without involvement in his crimes. He pointed to an announcement Monday night by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers that he's \"stepping back from public commitments\" as scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein builds.",
      "Summers said he was \"deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused.\" The correspondence that was published suggests Summers sought advice on women from Epstein: \"I said what are you up to,\" Summers wrote in part of one message, describing a conversation with the woman. \"She said 'I'm busy.' I said awfully coy u are.\"",
      "Epstein's reply read, in part: \"shes smart. making you pay for past errors.\" There is no evidence of illegal conduct on Summers' part.",
      "Schoen said, \"My fear is that people's reputations will be tarnished now because their names appear even though they did nothing wrong.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he expects the Senate will amend the legislation to address what he called \"serious deficiencies\" related to survivors' privacy and the possibility of unintended disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI sought to address some of those concerns in an unsigned July memo, describing a review of the files, which it said contain \"images and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography.\"",
      "The agencies wrote in their memo that \"while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein\u2026.no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",
      "Richman said he didn't put much stock in the Justice Department's decisionmaking related to withholding documents related to Epstein.",
      "\"Such withholding might well be normal, but here, I worry that it will be used as a cover for a selectivity that helps Trump and his friends and hurts those he considers his enemies,\" said Richman. The Columbia Law School professor is a longtime friend of former FBI Director James Comey, a frequent target of Mr. Trump's ire who was indicted in September on two federal counts related to past testimony to Congress.",
      "FBI review revealed no Epstein client list",
      "While Attorney General Pam Bondi implied during a Fox News interview in February that an Epstein \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, in the July memo her agency and the FBI claimed, \"this systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
      "\"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,\" the July memo said.",
      "Actress Alicia Arden, who accused Epstein of sexual battery during a 1997 incident, said during a Monday press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred that it's a bipartisan issue, and asked,",
      "\"Why would there be a single 'No' vote?\"",
      "\"Vote to release these files so we can finally see who else helped Jeffrey Epstein,\" Arden said.",
      "New Epstein investigation could affect any release of files",
      "A recently announced investigation could complicate the matter.",
      "Bondi said on Friday that she had asked U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to open an investigation hours after Mr. Trump demanded a probe into several prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "It is unclear how that new investigation might impact efforts to release files related to Epstein's closed cases. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky said Monday he worries that the new investigation could be used to block the release of some files. The Justice Department and Bondi have not commented further on Clayton's investigation.",
      "\"I'm concerned that now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" Massie, who led the effort to get the bill to the House floor, told reporters. \"I'm afraid they're going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they're subject of an ongoing investigation.\"",
      "During Arden's press conference Monday, attorney Gloria Allred echoed Massie's concern.",
      "\"So, now we're just involved in this political bloodbath trying to get answers. All I can say is when the fog of political war clears, I certainly hope that the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein will have more answers and information than they have now,\" Allred said.",

    "summary": "In some metro areas, child care expenses amount to more than double what families spend on rent, LendingTree found.",
    "story": [
      "As child care costs soar, many Americans today find themselves paying more for a caregiver than they do for their monthly rent, according to a new analysis.",
      "Child care costs for parents with two kids exceed rental costs in 85 of the country's largest metro areas, personal finance site\u00a0LendingTree found. In Omaha, Neb., Milwaukee, Wis., and Buffalo, N.Y., which have the highest child care costs in the country relative to local rents, families with an infant and a 4-year-old under care on average pay more than double the cost of their rent.",
      "Families around the U.S. pay an average of $1,282 for full-time infant care, still below the average monthly cost to rent a two-bedroom unit, LendingTree's data shows. Families with two children, on the other hand, spend an average of $2,252 per month on child care.",
      "LendingTree, which determined how child care costs stack up against rent in 100 cities. compiled its findings using data from nonprofit group Child Care Aware of America and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Exorbitant child care costs are contributing to what amounts to a crisis of affordability for many Americans, who also face rising food, housing,\u00a0energy and\u00a0health care costs. A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents\u00a0one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Schulz pointed to what she described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",
      "\"What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,\" she said.",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting push could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina is now the latest state to join a mid-decade redistricting gambit that could shake up next year's midterms, following similar moves by Missouri, Texas and California to redraw their House maps, along with a separate court-ordered effort in Utah.",
      "The redistricting push began with President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to find more seats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the state's districts and create five GOP-friendly seats, launching the first salvo in a push that has drawn national attention. It led to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's own campaign to redraw the map to help Democrats, which was approved by voters on Election Day by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to edge out Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district, and the legislation was signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican. In October, North Carolina Republicans targeted a single Democratic district as well, passing a map that redraws the 1st Congressional District to make it lean more heavily Republican.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Challenges remain in all states that are redoing their maps. In Texas, a federal court\u00a0blocked the state\u00a0from using the newly redrawn map in the upcoming midterm elections. The NAACP filed a lawsuit challenging Kehoe's authority to create Missouri's new map outside of a census year, and three other lawsuits have been filed. Despite getting the seal of approval by voters in California, state Republicans filed a lawsuit against Prop 50 after Election Day.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Abbott then called a special session of the Legislature with redistricting on the agenda. But two weeks into the 30-day special session, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum and prevent the legislation from coming to the floor.",
      "The Democrats ultimately returned after two weeks, and the legislation was passed, but they garnered significant national attention. Although California requires congressional maps to be approved by voters, Newsom vowed to redraw the state's districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats to counter Texas.",
      "Amid this push, other states have also started to discuss redistricting efforts, including Indiana and Florida, which could net Republicans several more seats.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See maps of how Texas, California and Missouri's push could play out, based on the 2024 election results:",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, 25 of which are currently held by Republicans. The other 13 are held by Democrats.",
      "Texas Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold but Mr. Trump and the GOP have made gains here in the past few years.",
      "In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump but reelected their Democratic member of Congress. The proposed maps are trying to add to those gains and box out those two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's\u00a0 district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, nine of whom are Republicans and 43 are Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three Democratic-held seats for the first time since 1994. They've held two of them, including Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the most northeastern part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "Utah redistricting",
      "Utah's redistricting is different from the other states' campaigns, starting with the fact that the state does not have any Democratic members of Congress. The redistricting push also wasn't kicked off by Mr. Trump and Republicans or in retaliation for moves by other states. Utah's 2025 redistricting was put in motion this summer when a judge ruled the current districts were in violation of a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature put forward four maps for public comment, and ultimately on Oct. 6 approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that will split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the Legislature map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "Utah currently has four representatives in Congress, all of whom are Republicans. Both senators are also Republicans. The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",

    "summary": "A federal court ordered Texas to use House district lines adopted in 2021 for next year's congressional elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal court on Tuesday blocked Texas from using its newly redrawn congressional map in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, a setback for Republicans as they work to maintain their narrow majority in the House.",
      "In a decision authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court\u00a0ordered the state to instead use House district lines adopted by the Texas legislature in 2021 for next year's congressional elections. The dispute was heard by a three-judge panel, which divided 2-1 in finding that voting rights and advocacy groups that challenged the redistricting plan were likely to prove that the 2025 map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The court found that plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the state legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said the decision will be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans' conservative voting preferences \u2013 and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" he said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"",
      "Still, the ruling marks an early blow for Republicans and Mr. Trump, who had urged Texas state lawmakers to engage in a mid-decade redrawing of their House map in order to bolster the GOP's chances of holding onto its majority in the lower chamber.",
      "\"A federal court just stopped one of the most brazen attempts to steal our democracy that Texas has ever seen,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said in a statement. \"Greg Abbott and his Republican cronies tried to silence Texans' voices to placate Donald Trump, but now have delivered him absolutely nothing.\"",
      "The map approved by the Texas legislature, which was signed by Abbott in August, redraws the state's congressional districts to create five GOP-friendly seats. The effort in Texas kicked off a redistricting battle that has expanded to other states. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, pushed to recraft his state's voting boundaries, and voters there approved a ballot measure earlier this month to draw new congressional districts. The map unveiled by California Democrats shifts five of the state's House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections.",
      "In both Missouri and North Carolina, state GOP lawmakers have approved new maps that target a single Democratic-held district in each state. But the battles over House district lines have also sparked court fights that seek to block the updated maps from taking effect.",
      "Under the original lines adopted by Texas' GOP-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census, Republicans hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats, while Democrats control 12. The death of Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, has left one seat open. Those voting lines enacted in 2021 were used in the 2022 and 2024 House elections.",
      "But with the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the House, and Republicans at risk of losing their hold on the lower chamber, Mr. Trump's political team began pushing Texas GOP leaders earlier this year to explore redrawing the state's congressional map. That effort picked up steam after the Justice Department sent Abbott a letter in July alleging that some of the districts in the 2021 map were racial gerrymanders that violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.",
      "The letter from Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, threatened legal action if Texas didn't dismantle and re-configure four Democratic-held congressional districts, which she said were unconstitutional.",
      "Abbott then added redistricting to the agenda for a special session of the state legislature and directed state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map to address the Justice Department's concerns. The new redistricting plan, signed by Abbott in August, creates five new districts that are favorable to Republicans.",
      "Soon after the map received the green-light from state Republicans, a coalition of advocacy groups moved to block the state from using it in the upcoming House elections. The plaintiffs argued that Texas lawmakers engaged in an unconstitutional racial gerrymander when redrawing the lines, while the state said it relied exclusively on politics, not race, during the latest redistricting process.",
      "The federal court in El Paso held a nine-day trial last month to address the claims and found that the nonprofit organizations were likely to prevail on their racial-gerrymandering claims.",
      "Brown wrote in his decision that the Justice Department, in its July letter, directed Texas to engage in racial gerrymandering when it ordered the state to rectify districts that it deemed problematic. The court said the Justice Department's letter effectively imposed a 50% racial target for Texas to meet when drawing congressional district lines.",
      "Brown also pointed to Abbott's actions in response to the letter, including his decision to add redistricting to the legislative agenda for the special session and his public statements.",
      "\"The Governor explicitly directed the Legislature to redistrict based on race. In press appearances, the Governor plainly and expressly disavowed any partisan objective and instead repeatedly stated that his goal was to eliminate coalition districts and create new majority-Hispanic districts,\" Brown wrote in his 160-page decision evaluating the redrawn map. \"The legislature adopted those racial objectives.\"",
      "The court said that supporters of the new redistricting plan also made numerous statements that suggested they retooled the district lines to create more majority-Hispanic and majority-Black districts.",
      "The judges also rejected any concerns that it is blocking the new map too close to the election. Courts typically avoid ordering late changes election rules to protect against voter confusion and disruption. But Brown wrote that if the new House districts can remain in place, voters will be forced to vote under a map that likely sorts them on the basis of race, depriving them of their right to participate in a \"free and fair election.\"",
      "Additionally, because the candidate-filing deadline is Dec. 8, the court said that the 2026 congressional election is not yet underway.",
      "\"To allow legislatures to redistrict as close to elections as possible while limiting the courts' ability to review the constitutionality of that action \u2014 even in extraordinary cases like this one\u2014 would unduly tip the balance of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches and impair the effectiveness of the Constitution's protections of voting rights,\" Brown wrote for the court.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:13:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "Is AI a Bubble? Not So Fast.",
      "Niall Ferguson: OpenAI's House of Cards",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The bill aims to impose restrictions on ballroom donors seeking to influence the administration.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats on Tuesday introduced legislation to put guardrails around private donations to fund construction on White House grounds and the vice president's residence.",
      "The bill, which comes in response to President Trump soliciting private money to fund a $300 million East Wing ballroom, is sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.",
      "The bill aims to impose restrictions on donors seeking to influence the administration in power and would require transparency. It would prohibit the president from soliciting donations, ban the display of donor names, bar donors from remaining anonymous and institute a two-year \"cooling-off period\" in which donors would be prohibited from lobbying the government.",
      "The bill, called \"Stop Ballroom Bribery Act,\" would also prevent donations from businesses or individuals with business before the government \u2014 including those facing federal litigation or enforcement actions.",
      "Several firms that donated to the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project have pending business before the government, like mergers requiring Justice Department approval or federal contracts hanging in the balance.",
      "\"Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether President Trump is building a ballroom to facilitate a pay-to-play scheme for political favor,\" Warren said.",
      "With Republican majorities in both chambers, the bill faces long odds. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, co-sponsored the legislation.",
      "\"President Trump has put a 'for sale' sign on the White House\u2014soliciting hundreds of millions of dollars from special interests to fund his $300 million vanity project. Our measure is a direct response to Trump's ballroom boondoggle,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment on the bill. In the Oval Office Tuesday, President Trump said the new, larger ballroom would be useful to host more guests at official dinners \u2014 like the one Tuesday night in honor of the Saudi crown prince. He said people were excluded from the event due to space limitations.",
      "In late October and early November, Blumenthal sent letters to more than 40 individuals, foundations and companies that supported the White House ballroom. Blumenthal sought answers about how much firms like Amazon and Comcast had poured into the project and whether they had the option to remain anonymous.",
      "So far, just 16 donors have replied. Their responses mention corporate civic pride and compliance with federal law, but offer few details about their financial contributions or substantive answers to the senator's questions, according to congressional sources.",
      "Microsoft was a bit more forthcoming than most. It said it was contacted by a fundraiser about making a donation in late September, according to the congressional source. The tech giant was given information about how to donate and an invitation to a dinner for supporters.",
      "That dinner was held in the White House's East Room on Oct.\u00a015. Several Microsoft executives were on the guest list, according to CBS News sources.",
      "Amazon said it started talking to fundraisers in August, not long after the project was announced, according to the congressional source. Amazon vice president of public policy Brian Huseman was the company's representative at the October dinner, sources said.",
      "NVIDIA told Blumenthal that it requested that the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit collecting donations, notify NVIDIA before making public statements about the company, according to the congressional source.",
      "Among those who replied to Blumenthal are Amazon, Apple, The Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, Booz Allen, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, HP, Meta, Micron Technology, Microsoft, NVIDIA, The Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Foundation, Reynolds, Ripple and T-Mobile.",
      "None of the firms or foundations specified how much money they contributed to the cause.",
      "Blumenthal is the top Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the investigative arm of the Senate's Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.",
      "Without a subpoena, firms and individual donors are not compelled to provide detailed answers to Blumenthal's questions. Responses are entirely voluntary.",
      "Congressional Democrats have written at least nine letters seeking more information about the ballroom.",
      "Jennifer  Jacobs\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "\"It's been torturous in many ways,\" explained Jane. \"I suppose many moments when I thought, \"How do I keep going?'",
      "WHO KILLED BOB DOROTIK?",
      "When \"48 Hours\" first met Jane Dorotik in 2000, the life she had once found so serene in the foothills outside of San Diego \u2014 a life she had shared with her husband Bob \u2014 had taken an unimaginable turn.",
      "Jane Dorotik: How can this be? How can this happen? Surely I'll wake up and it's a dream.",

      "Jane Dorotik: The family has always been incredibly important to both of us.",
      "Also important to Jane, were their horses. While Jane's passion was breeding and riding, Bob was an avid jogger. And that, says Jane, is the last image she has of her husband.",
      "Jane Dorotik: Bob was sitting, actually, in this chair, facing the TV.",
      "Although Jane was under suspicion, she allowed \"48 Hours\" into her home.",
      "Jane Dorotik: He said he was going out for a jog, and he was actually \u2014 had his jogging suit on, was tying his shoes. \u2026 That was the last I talked to him.",
      "It was around 1 p.m. on Feb. 13, 2000, when Jane says Bob left to go for that run. As hours passed without any word from him, Jane says she grew concerned.",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was beginning to get dark \u2026 I \u2014 decided to go out and look.",
      "Jane says she searched for Bob, driving up and down the hill where he sometimes ran. By 7:45 p.m., Jane's concern turned to fear.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I said, \"Enough. This is enough. Something is wrong.\" \u2026 And that's when I made the call to the Sheriff's Department.",
      "Deputy James Blackmon: My first \u2026 thought that night was maybe this man had a heart attack and \u2026 fell down the embankment along\u00a0 Lake Wohlford Road .",
      "As Deputy James Blackmon, and others from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, searched for Bob, concerned friends and family gathered at the Dorotik house.",
      "Claire Dorotik: The minute I saw my mom's face, I knew right away something terrible had happened.",
      "The Dorotik's daughter, Claire, 24 at the time, had spent the weekend visiting her aunt and returned home to a distraught Jane.",
      "Claire Dorotik: She was freaked out, she was scared, she was nervous, she was crying.",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was a horrifying feeling that got more and more horrifying when he wasn't found.",
      "And then, in the predawn hours of Feb. 14, Deputy Blackmon turned into a driveway, several miles from the Dorotik home, and noticed a body off the road.",
      "Deputy Blackmon (2001): At this point, I could see the shirt, the \u2026 pants \u2026 And he was laying on his back.",
      "From Jane's description, he immediately knew it was Bob Dorotik.",
      "Det. Rick Empson: I got there a little after seven in the morning.",
      "San Diego County Sheriff's Detective Rick Empson was called to the scene.",
      "Det. Rick Empson: There was no evidence of any type of vehicle accident.",
      "The evidence Empson did find suggested something else.",
      "Det. Rick Empson: I could see that he had blood on his face \u2026 there was blood near the back of his head, and I could see that there was a rope around his neck.",
      "Bob Dorotik had been bludgeoned and strangled. The one-time missing person case had turned into a homicide investigation.",

      "As law enforcement asked Jane questions about Bob, she let them into her home.",
      "Jane Dorotik: \"Come in. Search. Look for anything.\"",
      "Detective Empson noticed a piece of rope hanging from the porch that caught his attention \u2014 thinking he had just seen something similar on Bob Dorotik.",
      "Det. Rick Empson: It appeared to be the exact same type of rope that was found around his neck.",
      "And when investigators got to Bob and Jane's bedroom, they found something more troubling. They believed they were looking at blood spatter.",
      "Det. Rick Empson: There was no question in our mind that this assault occurred in the master bedroom.",
      "They documented their findings in a diagram, taking photos along the way of what they believed to be blood on various items in the bedroom, and of what appeared to be a large blood stain on the underside of the mattress.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I do know when Bob had a nosebleed he made a comment about getting\u00a0 some blood on the mattress.",
      "Jane says there was a logical explanation for some of the other blood, too \u2014 they had dogs who were injured and had bled.",
      "Jane Dorotik: This little dog had an abscess on her cheek that was openly draining at the time and little drops of blood we'd find when she sat on the couch. \u2026 The carpet pieces are what the detectives removed, feeling that there was blood on the carpet.",
      "The spots of blood investigators said they found\u00a0 all over the bedroom surprised Jane.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you have any other explanation of how that blood spatter could have gotten there?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Not really.",
      "Erin Moriarty: On the ceiling, on the window, on the walls?",
      "Jane Dorotik: No.",
      "Adding to authorities' suspicions was the bloody syringe found in the bathroom garbage. Jane told \"48 Hours\" she used it to medicate her horses.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I know that I give the horses shots all the time \u2026 if you go look in my fridge right now, you'll find horse syringes.",
      "Investigators theorized that Jane hit her husband with an object in the bedroom and strangled him. She then dressed him in his jogging suit, put him in their truck, and dumped him along the side of the road where his body was found.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why do they believe you killed your husband?",
      "Jane Dorotik: You know, I guess I've been through that one a billion times. I don't know.",
      "But investigators thought they knew, believing the motive was money, and escaping a troubled marriage. Jane was the main breadwinner, and they learned the couple had split up for a year in 1997.",
      "Jane Dorotik:\u00a0 I don't make any apologies for the fact that we had rough times. But that doesn't change the fact that we loved each other.",
      "And that love, says Jane, is why they reconciled. They had been back living together as a couple for a year-and-a-half before Bob was killed.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I really think the separation caused us to really regroup and think about what was important.",
      "Claire Dorotik: They were getting along better than they ever had in the past. I was living there. I can tell you that.",
      "But law enforcement was unmoved, and three days after Bob Dorotik's body was found, Jane was arrested, and charged with first-degree murder.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I know I didn't do this. I know there is a killer out there \u2026 but how am I going to clear myself?",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: She's baffled 'cause I don't think she knows what happened.",
      "Released on bail, Jane started preparing her defense, hiring attorney Kerry Steigerwalt.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: She knows she's placed as the killer and she's not the killer.",
      "And at trial, Jane's attorney would present a surprise suspect, who he felt was responsible for Bob Dorotik's murder.",
      "THE TRIAL OF JANE DOROTIK",
      "Jane Dorotik: I know that I am innocent, but I don't have any more faith in the legal system. I believe I could be convicted for something that I didn't do. And that's very scary.",
      "While Jane worried about her outcome at trial, Claire Dorotik was much more confident about her mother's chances.",
      "Claire Dorotik: My mom could not have done this crime. She didn't have the motive, and she didn't have the opportunity.",
      "But when the case went to trial in 2001, a year after the murder, prosecutor Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan described the Dorotik's marriage as seriously troubled and told jurors that Jane didn't want to pay Bob alimony in a divorce.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Bob Dorotik never went jogging. And he never left that residence alive.",
      "According to the state, Bob had actually been killed Saturday night, nearly a day before Jane reported him missing. The autopsy performed, by Dr. Christopher Swalwell, showed undigested food consistent with what Jane said they had for dinner that night.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Are you able to give us an estimate of how long after Mr. Dorotik ate, how long after that, he \u2014 he was killed?",
      "Dr. Christopher Swalwell: Yes. It was very shortly after he ate. \u2026I would say it was probably within a couple of hours.",
      "And he wasn't killed on the side of the road, the prosecutor said. There wasn't enough blood there. Instead, she said Bob's blood was all over the bedroom. Lead detective Rick Empson testified he had asked Jane to explain that.",
      "Det. Rick Empson (in court): She indicated initially that she had a dog that \u2014 had been bleeding, and then indicated that approximately a week prior, Bob had a bloody nose over in the corner by the stove, and that Bob had cleaned it up.",
      "There was evidence someone cleaned the bedroom. The carpet next to the potbelly stove and tiled floor was wet and had blood stains underneath.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did any of the blood from his nosebleed get on the carpet?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Uh huh (affirms).",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you know where?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Uh huh. Right next to the tile. 'Cause I \u2014 I'm the one that helped him clean it.",
      "Authorities dismissed Jane's explanations. Their theory was that Jane hit Bob in the head in their bedroom with an object while he was lying in bed, although they never identified or found any weapon. Charles Merritt, a criminalist and bloodstain pattern analyst for the San Diego County Sheriff's Crime Lab, recounted 20 locations where he saw blood stains.",
      "Charles Merritt (in court): On one of the pillows \u2026 on a lamp \u2026 this particular nightstand. \u2026 on the potbelly stove \u2026 on the ceiling itself. \u2026 and then on the underside of the mattress.",
      "The jury was also shown this evidence of tire tracks found near Bob's body. The state's expert Anthony DeMaria said he matched the three different types of tires on Dorotik's truck",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Are you saying the measurements taken at the scene were equal to the measurements \u2026 taken off the actual vehicle?",
      "Anthony DeMaria: Yes.",
      "The most telling evidence connecting Jane to the murder, according to the prosecutor, was that syringe found in the bathroom. It had traces of a horse tranquilizer inside. And even though there was no evidence that Bob had been injected with anything, it had Bob's blood and a bloody fingerprint on it.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): The evidence will show that the fingerprint on this syringe was Jane Dorotik's.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Can you explain that?",
      "Jane Dorotik: I can't really explain it, other than \u2013 I know that I helped Bob clean up a nosebleed. And if that's the same time when I took the syringes and threw them in the trash \u2026 and there was some blood on my hand, that could have \u2014 made that happen.",
      "But perhaps the most powerful witnesses were the Dorotiks' two sons, Nick and Alex. They both testified against their mother.",
      "Bonnie Howard\u2013Regan (in court): Did you say anything specifically about the syringe?",
      "Nick Dorotik: Well, I asked her \u2014 how it got there and what it was doing there.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan: And what was your mother's response?",
      "Nick Dorotik: She said that \u2014 her biggest fear in all this was that the \u2014 that us family members would start questioning her.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Your mother always settled things logically, tried to?",
      "Alex Dorotik: No.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: \u2014 you wouldn't agree with that statement?",
      "Alex Dorotik: Nope. \u2026It would be my mom basically saying, \"This is what you have to accept.\"\u00a0 And then my dad would either accept it or there would be threats of divorce or something. That's what I remember from growing up.",
      "Jane's attorneys Kerry Steigerwalt and Cole Casey admitted it was a big blow.   Erin Moriarty: Would you say that's been the most damaging testimony?",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: Yeah.",
      "Cole Casey: It's not what they said. It's the fact that they were there testifying for the prosecution.",
      "When it came time for the defense to present its case, Steigerwalt actually agreed with the prosecution on a major point \u2014 that the murder took place in the bedroom. But he had a jaw-dropping alternative suspect: Claire Dorotik.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Ladies and gentlemen, Claire hated her father.",
      "He claimed Claire, an avid horsewoman, hated her father because he threatened to sell the animals she loved \u2013 and suggested that she was capable of murder.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): That's what Claire is. A hot-tempered, explosive individual.",
      "It was a risky strategy that Jane reluctantly agreed to.",
      "Jane Dorotik: All I can do is trust what Kerry says is the best way to go.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Are you at all concerned that the jury will wonder about a woman who would allow herself to be defended by pointing the finger at her daughter? Could that work against the two of you?",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt: It may. I don't know. \u2026 \u00a0I think it is the most viable defense. And I think it's supported by the best evidence.",
      "Steigerwalt insisted Jane wasn't physically able to commit the murder, but Claire was.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): She runs marathons. And she's a personal trainer. She is as fit a woman as you will see at the age of 24.",
      "But remember, Claire and her aunt said they were together, two hours away.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): They called the aunt ...That's the extent of the investigation on the alibi of Claire Dorotik. \u2026 That alibi is nonsense.",
      "The jurors never heard from Claire, who took the fifth, or Jane, who chose not to testify. But they did hear from a woman who said she thought she saw Bob the day he disappeared \u2013 sitting between two men in a black pickup truck not far from where his body was found.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): Who killed Robert Dorotik? \u2026 Was it Claire Dorotik? \u2026 Or ladies and gentlemen, was it someone else?",
      "In his closing argument, Steigerwalt accused investigators of dismissing witnesses like that woman and focusing only on Jane.",
      "Kerry Steigerwalt (in court): The prosecution had focused on one person and that's not the way to conduct an investigation. That's not the way to run a case.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan (in court): Jane Dorotik and Bob Dorotik were the only two people in that home that weekend.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan said there is no need to investigate further when you have sufficient evidence.",
      "Bonnie Howard-Regan\u00a0(in court): They searched that bedroom and they saw all the blood and they knew that was the crime scene \u2026 What more investigation do they need to do?",
      "It took the jury four days to return a verdict.",
      "COURT CLERK: We the jury in the above titled cause find the defendant Jane Marguerite Dorotik guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree in violation of penal code \u2026\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did Jane Dorotik get a fair trial?",
      "Matthew Troiano: No. No. \u2026 Because fairness means that you're presenting things accurately, and it \u2014 it appears like it was not done accurately.",
      "JANE DOROTIK ADVOCATES FOR HER INNOCENCE",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview with Erin Moriarty): It almost didn't register for a minute. It's like \"No, this can't be.\" \u2026 I was so certain that I was walking out \u2026 I thought they would see the truth.",
      "Jane Dorotik never imagined she'd be found guilty.",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview): It's hard to keep going (crying).",
      "At the time of her conviction for the murder of her husband, she was 54 years old and sentenced to 25 years-to-life.",
      "Jane Dorotik (jail interview): I mean, I just, I can't see my way clear to a life in prison. I just can't see it.",
      "Determined to prove the jury got it wrong, Jane became her own advocate, working on her case for many years. \"48 Hours\" spoke with Jane again two decades later about her efforts.",
      "Jane Dorotik: All through the prison \u2014 my prison journey, I continued to write to \u2026 all\u00a0 innocence projects I could think of, asking for help. \u2026 At the same time, realized \u2026 that I had to fight for myself.",
      "Jane filed motions from prison citing such issues as insufficient evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I would describe my defense as limited and inadequate.",
      "In her filings, Jane indicated that she wanted to testify at her trial but had left that decision up to her attorney. And that had she testified, she could have explained Bob's stomach contents \u2014 stating that he sometimes ate leftovers from the previous night. She also described her attorney's alternate suspect theory, pointing to her daughter Claire as the killer, as absurd.",
      "Erin Moriarty: \u00a0Do you believe that your daughter Claire had anything to do with the death of her dad?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Absolutely unequivocally not. And my defense attorney, everybody knew she was away for that weekend.",
      "In regard to that defense strategy, Claire, later wrote in a book, \"how could I be angry at my mother, when all I did was worry about her.\" Jane's lawyer, whom \"48 Hours\" interviewed at the time of her trial, did not speak with us again.",
      "Jane Dorotik: That was the worst strategy of my life ever\u2026 I said to my attorney, \"If anything happens to Claire, I'm gonna stand up and say I did it.\"",
      "In her filings, Jane also questioned why her defense attorney accepted the \"bad forensics \"pointing to the bedroom as the murder scene, rather than presenting other scenarios as to where and how Bob Dorotik could have been murdered.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Did the defense too easily accept the bedroom as a crime scene?",
      "Matthew Troiano: That is a very legitimate argument.",
      "CBS News consultant Matthew Troiano, a former prosecutor and current defense attorney, was not involved in the Dorotik case, but he reviewed some of the court documents at \"48 Hours\"' request.",
      "Matthew Troiano: The defense made a strategic decision. \u2026 Are we going to dispute that a crime happened in this location or \u2026 are we essentially gonna concede that it happened there and then come up with a different narrative of how it happened there? And they chose the latter.",
      "And that decision, Troiano says, likely led the defense to point the finger at Claire for the murder.",
      "Matthew Troiano: They had to blame somebody else for something that happened in a specific location. \u2026 And they, at least, as it relates to the daughter, you know, went back to her, having some disagreement with her father about something. \u2026 And it was \u2013 it was a risk.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Have you ever seen that kind of defense?",
      "Matthew Troiano: You don't \u2014 you don't see it. I mean, it could happen when there are clear facts and evidence to support it, but when there are none \u2026 that's, you know, that's a showstopper.",
      "And, in fact, Claire was never charged with any wrongdoing in connection to her father's murder. The defense accepting the bedroom as the murder scene is especially puzzling to Troiano, as there were reports from several eyewitnesses who said they saw a man jogging that day \u2014 accounts consistent with Jane's depiction of events, not the prosecution's.",
      "Matthew Troiano: That's critical, critical evidence.",
      "Jane Dorotik: And all of that was really not pursued. \u2026 And \u2026 I didn't know of all the witnesses. \u2026 Had there been a thorough investigation initially, all of that would have come out.",
      "Through the years, in filings, Jane raised problems with the entire case against her, arguing that authorities focused on her from the very beginning of the investigation and failed to follow other investigative leads. But motion after motion was denied. And regarding Jane's ineffective counsel claims,\u00a0 the judge rejected them all, ruling that her attorney's performance was not deficient, and that his actions had not affected the outcome of the case.",
      "Jane Dorotik: There were many moments where I doubted when is this ever going to turn around. Many, many moments.",
      "Still, Jane didn't give up. She continued looking for new evidence to clear her, especially as DNA testing became more advanced. In 2012, she filed a petition for DNA testing of that rope found around Bob's neck, and other items, like Bob's fingernail clippings, which had been saved, but never tested. And in 2015, the motion was granted.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Is that unusual that she finally even got testing based on her filing motions on her own?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Yes, it's \u2014 it's very atypical.",
      "It was at this time that Jane finally got the attention of a wrongful conviction group, Loyola Law School's Project for the Innocent.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I get this wonderful letter from Loyola saying, \"You've contacted us and we're interested in your case. \u2026 And after that, Loyola took over. Got the testing done.",
      "And what that testing revealed, as well as a fresh examination of other evidence, would change the course of the case.",
      "Matt Troiano: That's really what flips the script to say that there's more here. This is more than just an inadequate investigation. There is a different narrative that's running through these test results. \u2026 there is evidence that another person could be involved.",
      "A NEW LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE",
      "Matthew Troiano: When you talk about the evidence in this case \u2026 the subsequent testing reveals that you might have a different explanation for things \u2026 that really shed light on what may have happened here.",
      "Jane Dorotik spent years behind bars asking for a new examination of the evidence used to convict her of her husband Bob's murder. Now, working with a team from Loyola Project for the Innocent, the court allowed them to have new DNA testing on items such as the rope found around Bob Dorotik's neck, his fingernails, and clothing. Appeal filings state that foreign male DNA was found on several items.",
      "Jane Dorotik: The results of that \u2014 none of my DNA anywhere.",
      "Matthew Troiano: There is physical evidence \u2026 from fingernail clippings \u2026 from a rope \u2026 from his clothing, that is foreign to Jane.",
      "The team from Loyola Project for the Innocent declined to be interviewed. We asked Nathan Lents, a Professor of Biology and Forensic Science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was not involved in the case, to review court documents about new evidence, such as the DNA on the rope.",
      "Nathan Lents: While they didn't get a profile that would be good enough to search a database or even match to a suspect, they did get enough DNA that is not attributable to Bob or to Jane.",
      "But while Jane and her team believed the results pointed to her innocence, the state came to a different conclusion, stating in filings: \"\u2026 the DNA obtained was too low level to make any reliable interpretation.\"",
      "Lents agrees the DNA levels were low, but he believes it was enough to exclude Jane, and that the absence of Jane's DNA on the rope, as well as under Bob's fingernails or on his clothing, is significant.",
      "Nathan Lents: With the theory of crime that they presented, you would expect a lot of Jane's DNA on Bob \u2026 and if \u2014 if she had moved his body, there's a lot of DNA transfer that might have taken place there \u2014 that wasn't found.",
      "The appellate team also reviewed the bedroom blood evidence the prosecutor told the jury was fully tested and was Bob's.",
      "Prosecutor Bonnie Howard-Regan (in court): \u00a0Now, the evidence will show that all this blood that has been described to you, the observations made in this bedroom, that it was all sent out for DNA analysis, and it all came back Bob Dorotik's blood.",
      "But according to the appeal, not every single spot in the bedroom believed to be blood was tested. Instead, representative samples were tested.",
      "Nathan Lents: There were cases where just simply one swab with a control was taken and it was representative, uh, of a variety of spots. That's not good practice \u2026 it just invites misinterpretation.",
      "Matthew Troiano:\u00a0 When you're talking about blood spatter and you're trying to analyze how it got there \u2026 you need to do a fairly comprehensive test to be able to draw the conclusion that you're drawing.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 But I think the prosecution could argue \u2026 You can't afford to test, can you, every single drop that looks like blood?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Right. \u2026 But when you say we did everything \u2026 and that's not accurate, that's where the problem lies.",
      "In fact, the appellate team says that several blood-like stains on items including a pillow sham, the nightstand, a lampshade, turned out not to be blood.",
      "And there were those stains on the bedspread, which criminalist Charles Merritt pointed to at trial and described as Bob's\u00a0 blood. Jane's lawyers learned those particular spots were never tested at all, and due to improper storage,\u00a0 the bedspread could not be tested again.",
      "The handling of the evidence, over the course of the entire investigation, was also raised on appeal.",
      "Nathan Lents (looking at photo with Moriarty): This one is hard to even look at. Um, you have an investigator who definitely should know better, um, handling murder evidence with his bare hands. \u2026 In addition to obviously depositing his own DNA all around this crime scene, he's also risking transferring evidence from among the various spots that he's collecting.",
      "And there's that syringe, with Bob's blood and Jane's fingerprint, found in the bathroom garbage \u2014 something the appellate team, and Lents, thought could be explained.",
      "Nathan Lents: And if you throw that syringe in the garbage can \u2026 Bob throws a \u2014 a bloody Kleenex in that garbage can, they could transfer. Transfer of DNA from one object to another in a trash can is not unexpected.",
      "Lents feels the fact that syringe was even found in the garbage, points fingers away from Jane.",
      "Nathan Lents: If you're cleaning up after a murder, you won't leave the bloody syringe in the waste bucket \u2014 basket.",
      "But the state stood by its original investigation, maintaining the bedroom was the murder scene, stating that the evidence still points to Jane Dorotik as the killer, and that the defense \"arguments are largely derived from speculation and misstatements of fact.\"",
      "Jane's appellate team, though, maintains the bedroom did not even look like a crime scene, something Lents also believes.",
      "Nathan Lents: There is not a consistent pattern to the evidence that indicates a violent bludgeoning that took place in that bedroom. \u2026 if Bob were alive today and investigators had walked in his room, no one would say, oh, this looks like someone was murdered here.",
      "Jane Dorotik: If you just look at all of the pieces of evidence that Loyola was able to absolutely take apart \u2026 and yet we know what was told to the jury in the original conviction \u2026\u00a0 So \u2014 how can that happen?",
      "As her attorneys reviewed evidence, Jane Dorotik, in 2020, was temporarily and conditionally let out of prison due to COVID health concerns. The question now became, was the new evidence her lawyers were finding enough to make her release permanent?",
      "JANE DOROTIK'S FINAL PUSH FOR FREEDOM",
      "In the summer of 2020, Jane Dorotik and her team hoped a court would overturn the jury's verdict, turning her temporary release from prison into lasting freedom.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What were their major points?",
      "Matthew Troiano: The testing that was done initially was insufficient. The way that that testing was presented to the jury was inaccurate. There were a number of different arguments that they made.",
      "A hearing was scheduled, but then suddenly the state requested an unplanned virtual hearing.",
      "PROSECUTOR KARL HUSOE (remote hearing): The people are willing to concede petitioner's new evidence claim\u2026",
      "The prosecution admitted what Jane's lawyers had argued all along.",
      "PROSECUTOR KARL HUSOE (remote hearing): The DNA evidence as it exists now, in 2020, is much different in quality and quantity than presented at trial in 2001.",
      "That the new DNA test results \u2013 as well as issues with how the Sheriff's Crime Lab handled evidence \u2014 cast doubt on the verdict. But what came next was even more unexpected. The state requested that Jane's murder conviction be overturned \u2026 and the judge agreed.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I always believed that at some point \u2026 the truth would come out.",
      "But Jane's ordeal wasn't over. Three months later, in another shocking move, the DA's office decided to retry her.",
      "Jane Dorotik: I don't think any of us thought \u2026 that San Diego County would attempt to retry me. But they did.",
      "Matthew Troiano: The state believes that she did this, and they want to pursue it. \u2026 Then you have this battle \u2026 in court. \u2026 If you're conceding that there were problems \u2026 how are you going to do it again, essentially with the same evidence?",
      "Jane Dorotik: It was astounding to sit in that courtroom and see what they try and put forward as actual evidence. And then also thrilling to see my team take it apart.",
      "Jane's attorneys questioned the credibility of several of the State's experts, including Charles Merritt of the Sheriff's Crime Lab. The judge ultimately ruled that the new trial could go ahead, but that some key evidence presented in her original trial would not be admissible \u2014 including those tire tracks near where Bob's body was found that were linked to Jane's truck.",
      "Matthew Troiano: You have a number of different trucks that could be consistent with those tire tracks \u2026 It's in essence kind of junk science-y.",
      "In May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecution surprised everyone yet again.",
      "Jane Dorotik: We go into court as the jury is assembled and ready to come into the \u2026 courtroom Monday morning. And everything's changed.",
      "Deputy DA Christopher Campbell (in court): We no longer feel that the evidence is sufficient to show proof beyond a reasonable doubt and convince 12 members of the jury. So we are requesting that the court \u2026 dismiss the charges at this time. Thank you.   Judge: Ms. Dorotik, you are free to go. Good luck to you ma'am.",
      "JANE DOROTIK (to reporters): It just is overwhelming to realize that now I can determine my own future. It's something I've prayed for and hoped for.",
      "After the hearing, Jane's attorneys spoke about her decades-long fight.",
      "MICHAEL CAVALUZZI ( to reporters) Jane's dignity in standing up and stoically fighting for her innocence against every risk and every threat. That's why this case got dismissed today and \u2026 as far as we're concerned, we're moving on.",
      "The District Attorney's Office and Sheriff's Department declined to speak with \"48 Hours.\" The case against Jane Dorotik was dismissed without prejudice, which means, if new evidence surfaces, charges could be brought again someday.   Erin Moriarty: But then, doesn't that leave still a shadow over Jane Dorotik?",
      "Matthew Troiano: Oh, sure, it does. I mean, there's no question about it. \u2026 From a practical perspective, do I think it's over? Yeah, I think it's over. But from a legal perspective, no.",
      "Jane Dorotik is working to rebuild her life after spending nearly two decades in prison.",
      "Jane Dorotik: My entire family has been blown apart by this hurricane of events. \u2026 It's been heartbreaking on so many levels.",
      "Claire Dorotik did not respond to\"48 Hours\"' request for comment, but Jane says they are still close. Her son Nick died in 2023. Alex Dorotik did not provide a comment to \"48 Hours,\" but according to filings by the state, he remains convinced his mother killed his father.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Do you have hope that your family will come together at some point?",
      "Jane Dorotik: Of course I do. Of course I have hope.",
      "Jane also has hope that she can make a difference in other people's lives, as she works with advocacy groups that help incarcerated women.",
      "Jane Dorotik: To me, it's not just about my story. And yes, we can all sit here and say, \"This is so horrendous.\" And \"How did this happen to this woman?\" \u2026 But unless we look systemically, how many others are we gonna find? And to me, that's critically important.",
      "Many unanswered questions about this case remain, including, perhaps, the most important one.",
      "Matthew Troiano: What happened here? \u2026 We don't know what happened to Bob Dorotik. \u2026 Where's justice for Bob? Where's justice for Robert Dorotik?",
      "Jane Dorotik sued the County of San Diego and reached a settlement in which the county will pay Dorotik $499,000. It does not include any admissions of wrongdoings.",

    "summary": "U.S. stocks slumped in early trading on Tuesday as Wall Street questions the strength of AI-led rally.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market sank sharply in early trading, with investors increasingly skittish about the strength of the artificial intelligence boom.",
      "The S&P 500, which set a record high in late October, fell 78 points, or 1.2%, to 6,594 roughly an hour into Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.",
      "The S&P 500 remains up more than 12% this year, the Dow has added 8% and the Nasdaq has risen more than 15%.",
      "AI pioneer Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market. The chipmaker's drop of 3.2% brought its loss for the month to nearly 11%, putting it in \"correction\" territory, or when a stock falls at least 10% from its previous high. The company is scheduled to report is third-quarter financial results on Wednesday.",
      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",
      "That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried stock prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the mania around AI.",
      "Despite Wall Street's recent stumble, many big investors expect stocks to recover, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",
      "Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 during the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-retirement-age-2026-change-66-67-increase/",
    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:27:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age is changing next year, affecting when the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers can collect 100% of their benefits.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security's so-called \"full retirement age\" \u2014 the age when people can start collecting all of their earned benefits \u2014 is about to hit a new threshold, a change that will affect Americans born in 1960 or later.",
      "The full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security is calculated using a worker's birth year, while their monthly benefits are based on the number of years they've worked and their income over that period. People may claim Social Security as early as age 62, but doing so permanently reduces their monthly benefit by about 30% compared with waiting until hitting their FRA.",
      "Starting in 2026, Social Security's full retirement age is set to make its final scheduled increase, marking the last step-up in age enacted under a\u00a01983 congressional reform\u00a0designed to shore up the program's finances. Before that overhaul, people could claim their FRA benefits at 65, but the law gradually pushed that age higher, culminating in the change that takes effect in 2026.",
      "Since 2021, the FRA has been rising by two months each year. It now stands at 66 years and 10 months for people born in 1959. Next year brings the final step in that schedule, when the FRA will reach 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later.",
      "With the FRA hitting 67, people born in 1960 won't qualify for their full benefits until 2027, rather than 2026. (You can check your own full-benefit age by entering your birthdate into this Social Security calculator.)",
      "The increase in the FRA will first impact the youngest baby boomers, or those born between 1960-1964, followed by Generation X, which spans 1965 to 1980. The change comes as many workers report feeling financially unprepared for retirement, with only about four in 10 Americans saying they're on track to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement,\u00a0according\u00a0to recent research from Vanguard.",
      "\"Raising the retirement age is an effective cut in lifetime benefits for younger baby boomers, members of Gen X and all the generations after,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the advocacy group National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, in an email to CBS News.",
      "While the increase in the full retirement age shouldn't come as a surprise given it was enacted 43 years ago, it doesn't guarantee older workers will be any more prepared financially for retirement, he added.",
      "\"Having time to plan, however, does not mean they have been able to put aside more for retirement, considering the stagnation of real wages and the rising cost of college tuition, home prices and other key living expenses,\" Richtman said.",
      "Retirement expectations versus reality",
      "There's also a longstanding gap between the age at which people expect to stop working and their real-world experiences, which can add to the financial strain of funding retirement. Many Americans believe they'll retire at age 65, but the median retirement age in the U.S. is in fact 62.",
      "Nearly six in 10 retirees say they stepped back from the workforce earlier than they had planned, according to research published last year by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. An October survey from the same group found that most middle-class retirees \u2014 people with annual household incomes between $50,000 and $199,999 \u2014 stopped working earlier than they envisioned because of employment issues, such as losing their jobs, or poor health.",
      "That gap between expectations and reality may explain recent research that found 44% of Americans said they plan to claim Social Security before they\u00a0reach their full retirement age, which would result in lower monthly benefits.",
      "Some Americans also flle for Social Security before reaching their FRA out of a belief it makes more sense to bank more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower monthly amount.",
      "Transamerica also found that nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore the conventional financial advice of\u00a0waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which locks in a 24% boost to a retiree's FRA payments.",
      "In the meantime, younger boomers and Gen Xers will have to hold off a little longer to claim their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"These younger cohorts will have to try their best to plan for retirement, knowing that they cannot collect full benefits until 67,\" Richtman added.",

    "story": [
      "Highlands, North Carolina\u00a0\u2014 In the North Carolina town of Highlands, about 20 feet below ground in a goldmine from the 1800s, there is a race against time to save a bat population whose numbers are being decimated by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.",
      "North Carolina's tricolored bats are unstable, among several species of bats quickly dying off in the dark. The bats eat the same bugs that kill crops, meaning they play a critical role in the ecosystem.",
      "\"As bat populations are declining, we see that there's a greater need for use of pesticides,\" said Rada Petric, a bat expert and research assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina who also serves as director of the UNC Institute for the Environment Highlands Field Site.\u00a0\u00a0These flying creatures may look scary, but the real monster in this cold and damp deathtrap is a highly infectious, bat flesh-decomposing fungus that will gnaw their wings right down to the bone.",
      "Lindsey Zarecky, vice president of conservation of research at the Greensboro Science Center, and Olivia Munzer, conservation coordinator for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, are among the biologists working to save the bats.",
      "\"Today we're just getting a count to see what is here, and how many of them are there,\" Zarecky said inside the old goldmine.\u00a0And there's only a handful of bats left in the cave. But it's not the fungus that is killing them. During winter hibernation, their white noses start to itch, waking them up and sending them looking for food that isn't there.",
      "They end up wasting precious calories looking for bugs that aren't in season, and they starve.",
      "So, biologists have turned to a new method that seeks to increase the fat stores of bats before they enter hibernation. It involves placing a bright bug-attracting light about a tennis court away from bat caves.\u00a0\u00a0\"How about if we fatten the bats enough, right before they go into hibernation, that it increases the likelihood of them surviving the winter,\" Petric explains.\u00a0Adds Munzer, \"There's a bit of patience, and definitely a glimmer of hope to watch these animals learn how to survive through this fungus in the winters.\"",
      "According to\u00a0the National Park Service, white-nose syndrome was first detected in North America in the early 2000s. Through 2018, it has caused the populations of three species \u2014 little brown bats, northern long-eared bats and tricolored bats \u2014 to decline by more than 90% in North America,\u00a0according to a 2021 study.",

      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",
      "Still unclear is whether Saudi Arabia will sign onto the Abraham Accords, a series of diplomatic deals brokered by Mr. Trump between Israel and majority-Muslim states like the United Arab Emirates. Most of those agreements were inked during the president's first term, and Mr. Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he believes Saudi Arabia will also join.",
      "During an Oval Office event earlier Tuesday, bin Salman told reporters he wants to join the accords but needs to see a path toward a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump added that the two leaders \"had a very good talk on the Abraham Accords.\"",
      "But Saudi Arabia's human rights record makes it a controversial U.S. partner. American intelligence agencies concluded in 2021 that bin Salman approved the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who regularly criticized the country's regime in the pages of The Washington Post.",

    "summary": "Hanan Elatr Khashoggi said Tuesday she was \"disappointed\" to hear President Trump describing her late husband, Jamal Khashoggi, in a way that \"kind of justifies a crime.\"",
    "story": [
      "As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman made his first visit to the White House since the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the wife of the late journalist says she was \"hurt\" and \"disappointed\" by the remarks of President Trump and bin Salman in the Oval Office on Tuesday regarding Khashoggi's killing.",
      "Reacting to the meeting between the two leaders, Hanan Elatr Khashoggi recounted what she said were \"seven years of hell\" in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday. She said that her husband did not deserve to be brutally killed over his criticism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and that she has not received an apology or seen any actions of accountability from the crown prince.",
      "\"It destroyed my life. It inverted my life,\" Elatr told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "Elatr came to the U.S. in August 2020 to apply for asylum because she feared for her safety, and was granted it in November 2023,\u00a0according to\u00a0CBS News' partner network BBC News. She had been living in Dubai, where she also grew up, prior to coming to the U.S.",
      "\"I was sharing his mission and vision. I'm the one supporting him in his exile. I was speaking up, putting in my social media, but it fired back at me,\" she said, adding that she was detained many times following his death and placed on house arrest until she decided to come to the U.S.",
      "Upon moving to the U.S., she alleges that she learned authorities in the United Arab Emirates had been surveilling even her prior to her husband's death, in collaboration with Saudi authorities.",
      "\"I discovered they were watching me since 2017, way before they killed Jamal,\" she said.",
      "Khashoggi's widow \"disappointed\" in Trump response",
      "During the White House meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that bin Salman, who also goes by MBS, \"knew nothing\" about Khashoggi's murder,\u00a0despite a U.S. 2021 intelligence report\u00a0finding bin Salman ordered the killing. The crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing.",
      "When he was asked about his business dealings with bin Salman, despite that report, Mr. Trump said of Khashoggi, \"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial.\"",
      "The 59-year-old Washington Post columnist was killed after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. In the first two weeks following his disappearance, Saudi officials denied any knowledge. Mr. Trump at the time admitted the nation had been untruthful, but\u00a0resisted blaming MBS for Khashoggi's death.",
      "\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it and we can leave it at that,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Elatr said she was \"disappointed\" to hear Mr. Trump describing her husband in a way that \"kind of justifies a crime.\"",
      "\"To say he's controversial ... it does not give anyone the right to just kidnap him, torture him, kill him and dismantle his body,\" she told CBS News. \"This hurt me a lot. It's taking away, as well, the freedom for the journalists to do their job. ... And what is the different then between U.S. and any dictatorship in Middle Eastern country?\"",
      "Demanding accountability",
      "While the crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing, he said in a 2019 \"60 Minutes\" interview that he takes full responsibility as the leader of Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"He admitted verbally, he took responsibility verbally, but he did not take any action to show the world there is rectifying of this crime,\" Elatr said Tuesday. \"... I did not receive an official apology myself as a wife, as they destroyed my life. They've taken my lover.\"",
      "Despite the 2021 intelligence report's findings, Elatr told CBS News that she doesn't know if MBS was directly responsible.",
      "\"I'm not sure 100% the order was given by the crown prince himself because I don't have the tools, I don't have the intelligence. I don't have a country to support me to dig in and to make sure,\" she said.",
      "Sitting next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, bin Salman said, \"It's painful and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that will never happen again.\"",
      "Elatr again said she believes those are empty words.",
      "\"I don't think they're doing their best. ... There's nothing. There's no real action that's been taken,\" she said.",
      "Call to increase tolerance for political opinions",
      "Elatr says she would love to meet with Mr. Trump because she wants to tell him about who the real Khashoggi was.",
      "\"Jamal Khashoggi was a very kind person and transparent,\" Elatr said. \"... You have absolutely different idea from Jamal, but you will be able to walk away with a smile, not upset.\"",
      "She also said she believes Mr. Trump can help create a more tolerant climate within Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I believe now there is an opportunity for President Trump and the crown prince himself to do something. ... It has to be some tolerance there,\" she said. \"... Jamal was not dangerous. Jamal only have his opinion.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:15:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Documents suggest Epstein had contacts with the Saudi royal family and traveled to the Kingdom in the last years of his life.",
    "story": [
      "In late 2016, Jeffrey Epstein flew his private Gulfstream G550 alone from Paris to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and emerged from the visit with a lavish gift, apparently from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was a tent, \"carpets and all,\" as he later described it. Bedouin tents, in Middle Eastern culture, are a symbol of hospitality.",
      "What Epstein was doing to be honored with that gift is currently a mystery.",
      "This was one of several meetings and interactions Epstein had with world leaders, according to emails and documents released in recent weeks that detail his activities in the final years of his life. They also included meetings with other members of the Saudi royal family.",
      "Bin Salman is visiting Washington this week and meeting with President Trump. It's a major moment for the Kingdom as it seeks to enhance its global image in the wake of the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. So far, Epstein's business dealings with the Kingdom and members of the royal family have largely avoided close scrutiny.",
      "Much of that information comes from the release of hundreds of text messages, emails and other documents sent to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate as part of the committee's investigation. Revelations about the tent and carpets were included in emails between Epstein and Hyatt executive chairman Tom Pritzker.",
      "Epstein's planning for his 2016 trip included an email from his assistant saying, \"Did you need me to book the Four Seasons for you in Riyadh? Or is the king taking care of it!?\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Saudi officials in D.C. for comment and has not had a response by time of publication.",
      "There is no evidence that anyone involved in the Saudi government had involvement with anything related to Epstein's sex trafficking allegations.",
      "Why Epstein's estate has chosen to release certain documents is not clear. The release is in response to a subpoena that included requests for documents relating to his finances, as well as potential victims. What has been released is likely a fraction of what the estate possesses of Epstein's communications, and it's not clear if there will be future releases that could provide additional details. Epstein maintained extensive communication with his staff, financial clients and friends over the years.",
      "As Congress voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to demand the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, most of the public's focus has been on his sex crimes \u2014 but any release of additional documents could reveal more about Epstein's vast global business connections, which have so far remained mostly unknown.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, told CBS News there are a host of unanswered questions stemming from Epstein's financial dealings all around the globe.",
      "\"My own investigation has found that Epstein was moving hundreds of millions of dollars around the world during the years he operated his cross-border sex trafficking operation, but it's still not clear who among his foreign network knew about his trafficking, enabled it, and participated in it,\" Wyden said.",
      "Epstein, who fashioned himself as an elite money manager, was also advising the governments of Mongolia and the Maldives, as well as traveling and presumably making or seeking business deals in the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Ivory Coast, China, Russia, Qatar and Belarus, according to those documents. But Epstein's contacts with Saudi Arabia appear to have been some of his most extensive and potentially lucrative dealings with foreign leaders.",
      "Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman consolidated his control in Saudi Arabia in 2017 following a purge of high level government officials. A few days later, New York Times reporter Thomas Landon Jr. emailed Epstein, \"Did your Saudi friends survive the purge?\" Epstein responded, \"All. With gods help ;).\"",
      "Epstein discussed another brush with the Saudi crown prince in April 2018. It comes up in a text message exchange with an individual whose name is redacted in the documents, but who appears from the context of their chat to be former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Epstein writes, \"MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] has the Louvre and 400 guards. To himself,\" and he indicates that he is on his way over.",
      "\"No better way to spend s(sic) Sunday,\" came the reply.",
      "That evening, French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted a photo of himself and bin Salman at the Louvre with the caption, \"With Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.\" CBS News has reached out to the government of France to find out if Epstein was present, but has not received a response.",
      "That document ended with a text the following day from Epstein to Bannon: \"If you are around the 18th, in dc. John Kerry,\" the former senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state.",
      "A spokesperson for Kerry told CBS News that he was back home in Boston after the end of his service in the Obama administration. \"He wasn't in Washington, DC, was never scheduled to be in Washington, and did not have a meeting or meeting request from that cast of characters, period, which isn't surprising since he didn't have a relationship with either one of them, and wasn't in contact with either of them,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "According to other messages sent from Epstein, he was planning another visit for the summer of 2019 to Saudi Arabia. That trip never happened due to his arrest and incarceration on federal sex crime charges.",
      "Other signs of the connections between Epstein and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have surfaced since his death. Authorities found a photograph of Epstein posing with bin Salman prominently displayed in his Manhattan mansion, according to The New York Times.",
      "After Epstein's arrest in 2019, officials also discovered that he held an expired Austrian passport from the 1980s with his picture and a false name, which listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.",

      "The death of the twins in Gr\u00fcnwald, a prosperous suburb of Munich where they shared a house, was reported by German newspaper Bild and news agency dpa on Monday, without named sources. Munich police on Tuesday confirmed the deaths, saying in an emailed statement that it was a \"joint suicide.\" In a statement, the German Society for Humane Dying confirmed to Bavarian Broadcasting that it was an assisted suicide.",
      "The Kessler twins learned to dance at a young age and joined the Leipzig Opera children's ballet. In 1952, when they were 16, their family fled to West Germany, where they danced in a revue theater in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1955, the sisters were discovered by the director of the Lido cabaret theater in Paris, where their international career took off.",
      "In the 1960s, the Kessler twins toured worldwide, moved to Rome and performed with Astaire, Sinatra and Belafonte. They turned down an offer to appear with Elvis Presley in \"Viva Las Vegas\" in 1964 for fear of becoming defined by musical films in America, dpa reported.",
      "Even at 80, the sisters appeared on stage in a musical. Alice said shortly before their 80th birthday that they probably wouldn't have managed to perform for so long alone.",
      "Being a twosome \"only has advantages,\" she said. \"Together you're stronger.\"",
      "Asked about the secret of their success, she remarked: \"Discipline, every day. Gratitude, time and again. Humility, not cockiness. And togetherness. Until death.\"",
      "The twins told the German tabloid\u00a0Bild\u00a0in April 2024 that they wanted to be buried in the same urn, along with the ashes of their mother and dog. \"That's what we stipulated in our wills,\" Ellen Kessler told Bild.",

    "story": [
      "An expansive ancient city has been unearthed in central Asia, shedding light on the area's industrial history and ranking as \"one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades,\" according to the lead author of a landmark new\u00a0report\u00a0on the site.",
      "The report, from researchers at the United Kingdom's Durham University and University College London as well as Kazakhstan's Toraighyrov University, offers the fullest picture to date of what Semiyarka, the \"City of Seven Ravines,\" may have been like in its prime more than 3,500 years ago.",
      "Located on the Kazakh Steppe, a vast grassland that covers northern Kazakhstan and parts of Russia, Semiyarka spanned some 350 acres and is currently the largest known ancient settlement in that region, according to the report. Originating around 1600 B.C.E. during the Bronze Age, the city was among only a few production centers at the time and the first on the Kazakh Steppe now known to have had bronze-producing capabilities.",
      "That's important for understanding the early communities of the steppe region, researchers said, as the archaeological evidence for Semiyarka's well-organized metal economy challenges prior beliefs that such societies did not exist in the area when Semiyarka did. The ancient city, which is called \"Seven Ravines\" because of its location overlooking multiple valleys, developed during a period where nomadic people began to form permanent or semipermanent settlements.",
      "Researchers previously thought only seminomadic people lived on the Kazakh Steppe at that time. But what they found after years of archaeological exploration of Semiyarka indicates that the site was not only a large-scale metal producer but, potentially, a crucial trading post with regional power. Its size, along with remnants of its manufacturing, \"highlight its potential importance for advancing our understanding of regional settlement patterns, social organisation and technology,\" researchers wrote in their report.",
      "\"This is one of the most remarkable archaeological discoveries in this region for decades. Semiyarka changes the way we think about steppe societies,\" Miljana Radivojevi\u0107, an archaeological researcher at University College London and the report's lead author, said in a\u00a0statement released by the university. \"It shows that mobile communities could build and sustain permanent, organised settlements centred on a likely large-scale industry \u2014 a true 'urban hub' of the steppe.\"",
      "Researchers at Toraighyrov University initially identified Semiyarka in the early 2000s, but the city was never thoroughly investigated before now.",
      "\"I have been surveying Semiyarka for many years with the support of Kazakh national research funding,\" said Viktor Merz, of Toraighyrov University, who initially identified Semiyarka two decades ago and co-authored the new report, \"but this collaboration has truly elevated our understanding of the site.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 A Stockholm court on Tuesday jailed four men for hate crimes for assaulting immigrants in a case that has shone a spotlight on a growing movement of white supremacist fitness clubs that some experts believe have their roots in California.",
      "The four men, aged 20 to 23, are members of an \"Active Club\" \u2014 loosely structured groups that meet in gyms and aim to promote white-nationalist, misogynist and hyper-masculine ideology.",
      "They were given prison sentences ranging from three to three-and-a-half years for aggravated assault after they beat up three men of foreign origin on Aug. 27 in Stockholm.",
      "The group first attacked a Black man with an umbrella while shouting racial slurs, prosecutors said. They then attacked a man of Syrian origin, knocking him to the ground and kicking him in the head until he lost consciousness and four teeth. Three of the four men then beat up a man on a subway train.",
      "\"The four men are of Swedish origin and have connections to Aktivklubb Sverige (AKS), which is considered a far-right organization with clear racist elements and which engages in martial arts,\" the court said in a statement. \"At least two of the men performed Hitler salutes during the night in question. All of the victims have an ethnic background different from the defendants.\"",
      "\"All of the crimes for which the men are convicted have hate crime motives, except for the vandalism,\" the court said, referring to neo-Nazi graffiti drawn on store windows.",
      "\"Intense hatred\"",
      "During the trial, prosecutors presented material seized from the four men, including notebooks with swastikas and stickers with the inscription \"Love Sweden, Hate Islam.\"",
      "The victims said they had been traumatized. The man attacked in the subway said he felt \"intense hatred\" as he was assaulted.",
      "\"I was beaten severely ... I didn't even have time to think before he took a running start and hit me with full force,\" he told the court.",
      "The victim beaten with the umbrella testified: \"It was as if these people knew what they were doing, that they were practicing kickboxing or something similar, that they were training to injure.\"",
      "The accused had denied the charges against them, save for the final assault, which was caught on security cameras. They claimed they acted in self-defense.",
      "The roots and rise of white supremacist \"active clubs\"",
      "According to the Swedish anti-racism watchdog Expo, \"Active Club\" members are encouraged to use violence outside the gym against targets including immigrants, feminists, Jewish and LGBTQ people.",
      "They \"hope to regain their masculinity by way of violence, improving their physical fitness and building a strong fraternity with other men who support each other,\" according to a document published by the Swedish Center for Preventing Violent Extremism.",
      "Sweden's intelligence service Sapo has warned of the risk of radicalization of young men attracted by violence and far-right groups like Active Clubs.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. legal advocacy group Southern Poverty Law Center said the prominent U.S. white nationalist hate group Patriot Front was using a network of \"Active Clubs\" across the country to boost its recruitment.",
      "Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of the clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "In 2021, Rundo started hosting a podcast called \"Active Club Podcast,\" on which he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish clubs. He promoted something he called \"white nationalism 3.0\" \u2014 a more local, decentralized approach for the white nationalist movement in the U.S.",
      "Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024.",

      "Eleven people have been detained in connection with the deaths of four members of the same family from suspected poisoning in Istanbul, the state-run Anadolu news agency said Monday.",
      "A Turkish-German woman, her husband and their two children, who were on holiday from Germany in Turkey's largest city, fell ill on Wednesday after eating several popular street food dishes in the waterside neighborhood of Ortakoy, at the foot of a bridge spanning the Bosphorus.",
      "They were taken to hospital but the two children died on Thursday and the mother a day later. Anadolu identified them as Cigdem Bocek, her son Kadir, 6, and her daughter Masal, 3.",
      "The father, Servet Bocek, died Monday after several days in intensive care.",
      "Istanbul prosecutors opened an investigation, initially focusing on suspected food poisoning. But evidence has since emerged that the family may have been exposed to pesticides in the hotel where they were staying, Turkish media reported.",
      "Quoting investigators, Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper said a substance was sprayed in a room on the ground floor of the hotel to combat a bed bug infestation, which may have reached the family's room on the first floor through a bathroom vent. Police collected samples from sheets, pillows, water bottles and blankets before sealing the building, the newspaper reported.",
      "The unnamed hotel in the Fatih neighborhood near Istanbul's historic peninsula was evacuated on Saturday after two more guests were taken to the hospital with similar symptoms, Anadolu said.",
      "The hotel was sealed off by municipal officials on Sunday, the agency added.",
      "Among those detained were five food sellers, the hotel's owner and two staff, and three people from the pest control company, it reported, without giving a timeline for exactly when they were all detained.",
      "Eight of them were to appear before a judge on Monday.",
      "A toxicology report prepared by forensic experts was expected to be released later on Monday, along with a report on the food samples being checked by experts at the agriculture ministry, Anadolu added.",
      "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after a Cabinet meeting Monday that \"our security forces and prosecutors will lead the necessary investigations to determine the causes of these deaths.\"",
      "The mother and her children were buried on Saturday at a ceremony in their family village in the Bolvadin area of central Turkey, about 150 miles southwest of Ankara, several Turkish newspapers reported.",
      "\"I offer my condolences to the family members who have passed away, and express my sympathies to their relatives,\" Istanbul's regional health chief Abdullah Emre Guner\u00a0wrote on X on Monday. \"Our investigation into the incident is being conducted with utmost diligence.\"",

    "summary": "Tension between Japan and China has escalated over the new Japanese leader's suggestion Tokyo could intervene militarily if Beijing attacks Taiwan.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 Japan said Monday that it had scrambled aircraft after detecting a suspected Chinese drone near its southern island of Yonaguni, which is close to Taiwan, on Saturday, as tension between the Asian adversaries spiked.",
      "On Sunday, Chinese coast guard vessels spent several hours in Japan's territorial waters around the disputed Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu in China and a frequent flashpoint, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said.",
      "The incidents came amid escalating tension between the neighbors over remarks by Japan's staunchly conservative new leader, who suggested Tokyo could intervene militarily in any hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "Beijing insists Taiwan \u2014 which Japan occupied for decades until its 1945 defeat in World War II \u2014   is part of its territory, and the prime minister's comments have sparked outrage among Chinese officials.",
      "Japanese leader's controversial remarks about China and Taiwan",
      "Before taking power last month, Prime Minister Senae Takaichi, 64, was a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific.",
      "If a Taiwan emergency entails \"battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan),\" she told parliament on Nov. 7. Under Japan's self-imposed domestic rules, an existential threat is one of the few cases where it can act militarily. Taiwan sits around 60 miles from the nearest Japanese island.",
      "In response to Takaichi's remarks, a Chinese diplomat stationed in Japan threatened to \"cut off that dirty neck,\" apparently referring to Takaichi, as China and Japan summoned each other's ambassadors.",
      "In Beijing, tech worker Daniel Feng called the Chinese government's responses \"very restrained\" given Takaichi's \"extremely unreasonable\" remarks.",
      "\"If she spouts words, that's not a problem ... but if they take real action, our country's military will definitely defeat them,\" the 40-year-old told AFP.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing on Monday to \"show restraint, act like a major power, and not become the troublemaker\" in the Asia-Pacific region, where peace and stability have been \"severely impacted.\"",
      "\"China should return to the path of a rules-based international order, which would help maintain peace, stability and prosperity in the region,\" Lai told reporters.",
      "Beijing, meanwhile, said Chinese premier Li Qiang had no plans to meet with Takaichi at the G20 summit in South Africa later this week, which they are both set to attend.",
      "Economic impact as Asian economic giants feud",
      "Beijing also advised its citizens over the weekend to avoid traveling to Japan, and warned the roughly 100,000 Chinese students in the country that there were alleged risks to their safety.",
      "Cabinet chief Kihara told reporters on Monday that the announcements were \"incompatible with the broader direction agreed upon by the leaders of the two nations.\"",
      "Japanese tourism and retail shares dived on Monday after China urged its citizens to avoid the neighboring nation's tourist hotspots.",
      "Asia's two top economies are closely entwined, with China the biggest source of tourists \u2014   almost 7.5 million visitors in the first nine months of 2025 \u2014   coming to Japan.",
      "Drawn by a weak yen making shopping cheaper, they collectively splurged more than a billion dollars a month in the third quarter, accounting for almost 30% of all tourist spending.",
      "Japan was also the fourth-most popular destination for Chinese tourists last year, helping the land of Mount Fuji, sushi and geishas set new records for foreign arrivals. But in fears that this may now stop, investors wiped 9% off Japanese cosmetics firm Shiseido's market value on Monday.",
      "Department store group Mitsukoshi fell 11.3% and Pan Pacific, behind discount retail chain and tourist magnet Don Quijote, slid 5.3%.",
      "Japan Airlines, whose shares nosedived 3.4%, has not seen any major cancellations on flights to and from China, a spokesperson told AFP.",
      "CBS News foreign correspondent Anna Coren reports that, apart from tourism there are concerns in Japan that China could inflict more economic pain by weaponizing its dominance in the supply chains of rare earth and other critical minerals, both of which are vital to Japan's electronics and automotive industries.",
      "Even Japan's film industry has been affected. Two movies due for release in China have been suspended.",
      "No off-ramp in sight for China and Japan's feud",
      "In response to the fallout, Coren said Japan on Tuesday urged its citizens in China to take precautions, including avoiding crowds and watching for suspicious people. Last year, a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in southern China.",
      "The tit-for-tat warnings from both capitals have fueled concern about nationalism being whipped up, and Coren said there was no apparent off-ramp available to ease tension. Japan sent a senior diplomat to Beijing for talks on Tuesday, but there was no announcement of any significant progress to ease the bilateral standoff.",
      "During the daily briefing on Tuesday at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesman demanded that Japan \"immediately retract its erroneous remarks, engage in profound self-reflection, change course, and provide the Chinese people with a clear explanation\" of Takaichi's comments.",
      "In Tokyo, the government maintains that the new prime minister's remarks did not represent any departure from previous policy.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 20:08:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The most advanced U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a display of American military power.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. is set to designate Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a group that the Trump administration has claimed is headed by Venezuela's president \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Sunday night, hours after the most advanced aircraft carrier in the nation crossed into the Caribbean Sea, the U.S. Navy said.",
      "Rubio's announcement and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford mark a major moment in what the Trump administration says is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Cartel de los Soles' designation as a foreign terrorist organization is set to go into effect on Nov. 24, Rubio said in a statement. He alleged the cartel is headed by Maduro and \"other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.\"",
      "\"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio added. \"Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters Sunday night after the announcement was made, President Trump said, \"We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk.\"",
      "Cartel de los Soles is not known to be a traditional, hierarchical drug cartel like the Sinaloa or Tren de Aragua The term is instead generally used to describe a loose, decentralized network of military and government officials within the Venezuelan state who are alleged to be involved in the illegal drug trade.",
      "The U.S. has asserted that Maduro is complicit with armed criminal gangs that smuggle drugs into the U.S., allegations that Maduro has rejected. And over the last two months, the U.S. military has\u00a0conducted strikes against at least 22 vessels it alleges were ferrying drugs from South America to the U.S., killing at least 83 people.",
      "\"Through unwavering commitment and the precise use of our forces, we stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey, commander of U.S. Southern Command, said Sunday in a statement announcing the USS Ford's arrival in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group's deployment represents a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland,\" he added. Southern Command is the primary combatant unit for operations in the Caribbean and South America.",
      "The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations, in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear. The Ford's carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.",
      "Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the Ford's carrier strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.\"",
      "The administration has insisted that the buildup of warships is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were \"narco-terrorists.\"",
      "President Trump said Friday that he's \"sort of\" decided how to proceed on Venezuela, as\u00a0top officials\u00a0weigh potential military operations in the Latin American country. \"I sort of have made up my mind\" about the administration's next steps in Venezuela, he told CBS News aboard Air Force One, but \"I can't tell you what it would be.\"",
      "Top Trump administration officials, military and senior staff gathered at the White House for at least the third day in a row on Friday to discuss possible military operations in Venezuela, according to sources familiar with the matter. Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among those who spoke with Mr. Trump at the White House on Friday, the sources said.",
      "Venezuela was also discussed as part of the president's daily intelligence briefing on Wednesday. CBS News has\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that Hegseth, Caine and other military officials presented Mr. Trump on Wednesday with options for potential operations in\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0in the coming days, including possible strikes on land.",
      "Meanwhile, Venezuela announced Tuesday that it was\u00a0launching a massive military exercise\u00a0across the country, reportedly involving some 200,000 forces.",
      "Many people both inside Venezuela, including Maduro himself, and observers outside the country believe the increased U.S. military pressure is\u00a0aimed at forcing Maduro out of office.",
      "When asked\u00a0in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes\" if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\" Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "The president has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. He has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and lawmakers, including some Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.",
      "Senate Republicans\u00a0recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support the resolution, which failed in a 49-51 vote.",
      "Experts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message, one expert said.",
      "\"This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,\" Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst for the Andes region, told The Associated Press. \"And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.N. Security Council on Monday approved a U.S. plan for Gaza that authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security in the devastated territory and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Russia, which had circulated a rival resolution, abstained along with China on the 13-0 vote. The U.S. and other countries had hoped Moscow would not use its veto power on the United Nations' most powerful body to block the resolution's adoption.",
      "The vote was a crucial next step for the fragile ceasefire and efforts to outline Gaza's future following two years of war between Israel and Hamas. Arab and other Muslim countries that expressed interest in providing troops for an international force had signaled that Security Council authorization was essential for their participation.",
      "The ceasefire went into effect on Oct. 10, but accusations of violations of the terms by both Hamas and Israel had threatened to upend the deal in the weeks since its implementation.",
      "The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to release all living and deceased hostages in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel. While the living hostages were returned by the deadline, the remains of some of the dead hostages had not been handed over \u2014 with both Hamas and U.S. officials citing the difficulties in recovering some of the remains amid the destruction in the Gaza Strip \u2014 which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said constituted a violation.",
      "There have also been flare-ups of violence in Gaza, including airstrikes from Israel, which it said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces, since the deal went into effect. International advocates have also accused Israel of not adhering to the requirement to deliver all of the aid it promised to Gaza in the deal.",
      "The U.S. resolution endorses President Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan, which calls for a yet-to-be-established Board of Peace as a transitional authority that Mr. Trump would head. It also authorizes the stabilization force and gives it a wide mandate, including overseeing the borders, providing security and demilitarizing the territory. Authorization for the board and force expires at the end of 2027.",
      "\"Congratulations to the World on the incredible Vote of the United Nations Security Council, just moments ago, acknowledging and endorsing the BOARD OF PEACE, which will be chaired by me, and include the most powerful and respected Leaders throughout the World,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media following the U.N. vote. He thanked the members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, and said, \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the U.N.'s adoption of the plan, saying, \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation,\" according to Reuters.",
      "\"Any international force, if established, must be stationed solely on the borders to separate the forces and monitor the ceasefire, and must be entirely under the supervision of the United Nations,\" Hamas said, according to Al Jazeera.",
      "During nearly two weeks of negotiations on the U.S. resolution, Arab nations and the Palestinians had pressed the United States to strengthen the original weak language about Palestinian self-determination.",
      "The U.S. revised it to say that after the Palestinian Authority \u2014 which now governs parts of the West Bank \u2014 makes reforms and after redevelopment of the devastated Gaza Strip advances, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it adds.",
      "That language angered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed Sunday to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. He has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel's borders.",
      "A key to the resolution's adoption was support from Arab and Muslim nations pushing for a ceasefire and potentially contributing to the international force. The U.S. mission to the U.N. distributed a joint statement Friday with Qatar, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and Turkey calling for \"swift adoption\" of the U.S. proposal.",
      "The vote took place amid hopes that Gaza's fragile ceasefire would be maintained after a war set off by Hamas' surprise terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel's more than two-year offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.",
      "Russia last week suddenly circulated a rival proposal with stronger language supporting a Palestinian state alongside Israel and stressed that the West Bank and Gaza must be joined as a state under the Palestinian Authority.",
      "It also stripped out references to the transitional board and asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to provide options for an international force to provide security in Gaza and for implementing the ceasefire plan, stressing the importance of a Security Council role.",
      "The U.S. resolution calls for the stabilization force to ensure \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\" and \"the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.\" A big question is how to disarm Hamas, which has not fully accepted that step.",
      "It authorizes the force \"to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate\" in compliance with international law, which is U.N. language for the use of military force.",
      "The resolution says the stabilization troops will help secure border areas, along with a Palestinian police force that they have trained and vetted, and they will coordinate with other countries to secure the flow of humanitarian assistance. It says the force should closely consult and cooperate with neighboring Egypt and Israel.",
      "As the international force establishes control and brings stability, the resolution says Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\" These must be agreed to by the stabilization force, Israeli forces, the U.S. and the guarantors of the ceasefire, it says.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:33:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The attackers, who have not yet claimed responsibility publicly, killed one person and kidnapped more than two dozen students.",
    "story": [
      "More than two dozen schoolgirls have been abducted and one staffer has been killed after gunmen attacked a high school in northwestern Nigeria, police said in the region.",
      "No group immediately claimed responsibility for the abductions of 25 girls from the boarding school in Kebbi state, and the motivation for the attack is unclear.",
      "Nigeria has been facing a multi-dimensional security challenge with threats from a range of different groups. Armed bandits who specialize in kidnapping for ransom \u2014 sometimes totaling thousands of dollars \u2014 have been responsible for several high-profile abductions across Nigeria's northern region. Kidnappings and attacks on villages and along major roads have become common because of the limited security presence.",
      "Those bandits are not connected to militant groups such as Boko Haram and the splinter group Islamic State West Africa Province, whose attacks on communities and government installations are motivated by religion.",
      "Police said the boarding school girls were taken from their dorms at about 4 a.m. Monday. The school is in Maga, in the state's Danko-Wasagu area, police spokesperson Nafi'u Abubakar Kotarkoshi said.",
      "The assailants were armed with \"sophisticated weapons\" and exchanged fire with guards before abducting the girls, Kotarkoshi said.",
      "\"A combined team is currently combing suspected escape routes and surrounding forests in a coordinated search and rescue operation aimed at recovering the abducted students and arresting the perpetrators,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Attacks have targeted schoolchildren in the region since at least 2014, when Boko Haram abducted 276 students from Chibok in Borno state. That abduction marked the beginning of a new era of fear. Dozens remain in captivity.",
      "Since the Chibok abductions, at least 1,500 students have been kidnapped, as armed groups increasingly find in abductions a lucrative way to fund other crimes and control villages in the nation's mineral-rich but poorly policed region. In March 2024, more than 130 schoolchildren were rescued after spending more than two weeks in captivity in the Nigerian state of Kaduna.",

      "Australian cyclist Paige Greco, a Paralympic gold medalist, has died. She was 28.",
      "A joint statement by the Australian Paralympic Committee and Australian Cycling Federation said that Greco \"passed away in her Adelaide home after experiencing a sudden medical episode\" on Sunday.",
      "\"Paige meant everything to us,\" her mother Natalie Greco said in a statement. \"Her kindness, her determination and her warmth touched our family every single day. She brought so much joy and pride into our lives, and the pain of her passing is something we will carry forever.",
      "\"While we are devastated by her loss, we are incredibly proud of the person she was and the way she represented Australia.\"",
      "Greco, who was born with cerebral palsy, won the first gold medal of the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Paralympics in 2021, breaking her own world record in the women's C1-3 3,000-meter individual pursuit. She went on to add bronze medals in the road race and time trial.",
      "In August, she won another bronze medal at the para-cycling World Championships in Belgium, this time for the C3 road race event, BBC News reported.",
      "Greco also won multiple world championship titles and World Cup medals, after bursting onto the para-cycling scene with three world records, two gold medals and a silver at the 2019 track world championship \u2014 just a year after switching to cycling from para-athletics.",
      "Cameron Murray, chief executive officer of Paralympics Australia, said the loss of one of the brightest young stars of the Australian Paralympic movement was devastating.",
      "\"The sadness being felt across Paralympics Australia today is a reflection of the enormous regard in which she was held,\" Murray said. \"Paige was an extraordinary athlete, but more importantly, a remarkable person.",
      "\"Her achievements on the international stage were exceptional, but it was her kindness, her quiet determination and the way she uplifted people around her that will stay with us all. She had a rare ability to make people feel included and supported, and her influence will no doubt leave a lasting impression on so many.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:22:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A human rights group says the \"rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody\" shows a loss of \"all moral and professional restraint.\"",
    "story": [
      "At least 94 Palestinians died in Israeli custody between Oct. 7, 2023, and August 2025, according to a report by an Israel-based human rights group led by medical professionals, representing a dramatic surge in prisoner deaths during the war in Gaza.",
      "The report by Physicians for Human Rights \u2014 Israel (PHRI) says its figures may only represent a portion of the total actual deaths of Palestinians in civil or military detention.",
      "The PHRI says its research revealed \"deeply concerning patterns of physical violence and medical negligence,\" which it says were the two primary factors behind the deaths of most Palestinians in Israeli custody.",
      "\"The alarming rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody reveals a system that has lost all moral and professional restraint,\" said Naji Abbas, a director at PHRI.",
      "PHRI documented the deaths by interviewing former detainees and prison medical staff, examining reports prepared by doctors who observed autopsies at the behest of dead prisoners' families, and confirming dozens of fatalities through freedom of information requests for Israeli government data.",
      "The Israeli prison service said in response to the PHRI report that all of its facilities are operated in adherence with Israeli laws and with proper oversight.",
      "The PHRI says it analyzed post-mortem examinations that showed some Palestinian detainees died after sustaining bruising \"consistent with beatings,\" multiple rib fractures, hemorrhages and lacerations of intra-abdominal organs.",
      "Among the examples it cites of purported medical negligence, the PHRI notes one case of documented severe malnutrition and several cases of severe infections that it said were left untreated.",
      "The authors of the report used official Israeli data obtained through freedom of information requests as well as individual inquiries to compile its report. It says that of the 94 Palestinians who died in Israeli detention facilities since October 2023, 68 were from the Gaza Strip. The remaining 26 were from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and some also held Israeli citizenship.",
      "PHRI says the actual death toll over this timeframe is \"likely significantly higher,\" noting that Israel has refused to provide information about hundreds of Palestinians detained during the war.",
      "Fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years preceding the war, the PHRI says. But since the war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, the organization says Israel's prison population more than doubled to 11,000 as people were rounded up, mainly from Gaza and the West Bank.",
      "The number of prisoners dying grew at an even faster rate over that period, PHRI data show.",
      "In response to the report, the Israel Prison Service told CBS News it operates \"in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies.\"",
      "The service said it was not aware of the specific incidents presented in the report, and that the claims \"do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service.\"",
      "The IPS also maintains that inmates have adequate access to medical care, hygiene and adequate living conditions.",
      "Last year, the far-right, nationalist government minister in charge of Israel's prison system, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasted that he had degraded prison conditions to the legal minimum, vowing they would no longer be \"summer camps.\"",
      "Under pressure from rights groups, conditions in Israeli detention facilities have improved slightly in recent months, the PHRI says.",
      "Personal testimonies from prison staff",
      "A former nurse at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel, whom the PHRI said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, told the organization chains were used to shackle many prisoners' arms and legs, causing such severe wounds in some cases that Palestinians' limbs had to be amputated.",
      "During the several weeks in early 2024 when she said she worked at the facility, which has held many detainees from Gaza and been the focus of high-profile abuse allegations, she said she didn't see anyone die, but that staff had mentioned prisoner deaths. PHRI said she left the job in response to the alleged abusive treatment of the prisoners.",
      "The Israeli army said prolonged handcuffing is implemented only in exceptional cases, when there are \"significant security considerations.\" Even then, detainees' medical condition is taken into account, it said. Only a few detainees from Gaza are currently being handled this way, it added.",
      "A former Sde Teiman guard told PHRI that colleagues were at some point asked by their commanders \u2014 whom she said participated in the beatings \u2014 to reduce the number of deaths. Eventually cameras were installed, which helped mitigate the alleged abuse, the PHRI says.",
      "PHRI's report says 29 prisoners have died at Sde Teiman since the war began. Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier was convicted of abusing Palestinian detainees at Sde Teiman and sentenced in a high profile case to seven months in prison, which the army said was evidence of accountability.",
      "But lawyers for prisoners say Israel rarely conducts serious investigations into alleged violence, which it claims fuels the problem.",
      "In a sign of the public mood on the issue, the Israeli military's top lawyer was recently forced to resign after admitting that she had approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of an investigation into allegations of severe abuse against a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman.",
      "She said she intended the leak to defend the decision by her office to prosecute guards for the alleged abuses. Instead, it triggered fierce criticism from hard-line Israelis, including some in the government, who sympathized with the guards. Sde Teiman and another detention center were swarmed by angry protesters who clashed with prison guards and tried to breach both facilities.",
      "Several soldiers were indicted in the case, which is still pending before a military court.",
      "It is difficult to pinpoint with certainty the cause of death for most prisoners. Sometimes, at the behest of prisoners' families, doctors were granted permission by Israel to attend autopsies and provided reports to the families on what they saw.",
      "Purported medical negligence",
      "Eight reports cited by the PHRI and seen by The Associated Press showed a pattern of physical abuse and medical neglect.",
      "In one, a 45-year-old man who died in Kishon detention center, Mohammad Husein Ali, showed multiple signs of physical assault, likely causing brain bleed, according to the report. The potential use of excessive restraints was also noted.",
      "His family said he was healthy before he was detained at his home in the West Bank. He died within a week of being imprisoned.",
      "Malnutrition was a contributing factor in at least one detainee death, according to PHRI, with a 17-year-old boy dying from starvation.",
      "In September, Israel's Supreme Court ordered that more and better food be served to Palestinian inmates. Rights groups say the situation has slightly improved.",
      "The army said detainees receive three meals a day, approved by a dietitian. It said every detainee is examined by a doctor upon arrival and, for those who need it, monitored with regular checkups.",

      "There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to the French-Ukrainian military agreement, which both Paris and Kyiv touted as a landmark moment.",
      "\"Today marks a significant moment, truly historic for both our nations \u2014   France and Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post, adding that the joint defense agreement, \"enables Ukraine to procure military equipment from France's defense industrial and technological base, including 100 Rafale F4 aircraft by 2035 for Ukraine's combat aviation, SAMP/T air-defense systems, air-defense radars, air-to-air missiles, and aerial bombs.\"",

    "summary": "Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been sentenced to death on charges of crimes against humanity after a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last year.",
    "story": [
      "A special tribunal sentenced Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on charges of crimes against humanity involving last year's mass uprising that killed hundreds of people and ended her 15-year rule.",
      "The tribunal also sentenced former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan to death in the case while a third suspect \u2014 a former police chief \u2014   was sentenced to five years in prison as he became a state witness against Hasina and pleaded guilty.",
      "Hasina and Khan faced the charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of hundreds of people during a student-led uprising in July and August of 2024. The United Nations in a February report said up to 1,400 may have been killed in the violence, while the country's health adviser under the interim government said more than 800 people were killed and about 14,000 were injured.",
      "The deliberation of the verdict from the tribunal in the capital, Dhaka, was broadcast live on Monday.",
      "The interim government beefed up security ahead of the verdict, with paramilitary border guards and police deployed in Dhaka and many other parts of the country. CBS News' British partner network BBC News said security forces had deployed tear gas amid unrest following the announcement of the sentencing on the streets of Dhaka on Monday.",
      "Hasina's Awami League party has called for a nationwide shutdown to protest the verdict. Hasina and Khan, who have been in exile in India, were tried in absentia.",
      "Both Hasina and her party have called the tribunal a \"kangaroo court\" and denounced the appointment of a lawyer by the state to represent her.",
      "The tribunal last week had fixed Monday for delivering the verdict as reports of explosions of crude bombs and arson led to the disruption of classes and transportation across the country after the \"lockdown\" called for by Hasina's party.",
      "Before the tribunal's ruling Monday, the former ruling party called for the shutdown again, with Hasina in an audio message urging her supporters not to be \"nervous\" about the verdict.",
      "The verdict came after local media reported new explosions of crude bombs in Dhaka, including one in front of the house of an adviser, equivalent to a Cabinet minister, on Sunday.",
      "Meanwhile, Dhaka's police chief Sheikh Mohammad Sazzat Ali issued a \"shoot-on-sight\" order if anyone attempts to torch vehicles or hurl crude bombs. The directive came as nearly 50 arson attacks, mostly targeting vehicles, and dozens of explosions of crude bombs have been reported nationwide over the past week. Two people were killed in the arson attacks, local media reported.",
      "Authorities at the Supreme Court, in a letter to army headquarters on Sunday, requested the deployment of soldiers around the tribunal premises ahead of the verdict.",
      "Hasina was ousted on Aug. 5 last year and fled to India. Bangladeshi Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took over as the head of an interim government three days after her fall. Yunus vowed to punish Hasina and banned the activities of her Awami League party.",
      "Yunus said his interim government would hold the next elections in February, and that Hasina's party would not get a chance to contest the race.",
      "Dhaka-based human rights activist Shireen Huq, who works with people injured during the unrest, told the BBC on Monday that the \"harsh punishment\" for Hasina would offer little solace for the families of people killed and maimed during last summer's crackdown on protesters.",
      "\"They will never be able to forgive her,\" she told the BBC, adding that many people's anger at Hasina's political party also had \"not subsided.\"",
      "\"Neither she nor the party has apologized or shown any remorse for the killings of hundreds of people,\" Huq said. \"It makes it difficult for the party to be accepted by a majority of people in this country.\"",

    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "In an update on Nov. 13, Google said its request for a temporary restraining order \"was granted just hours after the complaint was filed, and the Lighthouse operation is now essentially dark.\"",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "EVEN LOW-CALORIE PROCESSED FOOD CAUSES WEIGHT GAIN, TESTOSTERONE LOSS IN MEN, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "Late-night eating, larger portions, less fiber and high caffeine intake also stack the deck against men, he said. In addition to dietary choices, men\u2019s lifestyle behaviors can also impact digestion.",
      "Late-night eating and larger portions are part of what make men more prone to acid reflux and other digestive issues. (iStock)",
      "\"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on convenience foods stripped of minerals and fiber,\" Gioffre said.",
      "Over time, this \"ongoing acid assault\" erodes the gut lining, drives acid upward and turns normal esophageal cells into precancerous Barrett\u2019s cells, increasing cancer risk dramatically, he warned.",
      "Biggest food culprits",
      "When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and seed oils.",
      "\"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs,\" he said.",
      "\"Men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes.\"",
      "Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.",
      "\"That constant caffeine hit strips minerals, dehydrates the body and spikes acidity \u2014 all of which increase the risk of reflux.\"",

      "Ultimately, he said, \"men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes. Otherwise, reflux will only keep getting worse and harder to treat.\"",
      "Biological differences",
      "There are some biological differences between the genders that contribute to men\u2019s higher risk of severe gastrointestinal conditions, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva \u2014 the body\u2019s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder,\" he said.",
      "Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water. (iStock)",
      "\"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications.\"",
      "Younger men also tend to carry more visceral (abdominal) fat, Gioffre noted, which increases pressure in the stomach and forces acid up into the esophagus.",
      "SCIENTISTS REVEAL HOW YOUR FAVORITE SODA COULD QUIETLY MESS WITH YOUR MOOD",
      "Hormones also play a role.",
      "\"Estrogen in women appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of,\" the doctor said. \"Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn\u2019t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure.\"",
      "5 things to start doing right now",
      "Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.",
      "\"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating too close to bedtime,\" Gioffre said. \"When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it\u2019s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus.\"",
      "Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\" (iStock)",
      "This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\"",
      "Gioffre said it\u2019s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.",
      "Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs,\" he said. \"Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining.\"",
      "\"If you want to heal reflux naturally, you can\u2019t just change what you eat \u2014 you have to change how you live.\"",
      "The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic. Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.",
      "Gioffre recommends starting the morning with warm lemon water with a teaspoon of local honey, or a tea with slippery elm.",

      "\"These activate your parasympathetic \u2018rest-and-digest\u2019 system, calm your gut and keep acid levels in check naturally,\" Gioffre said. \"Get outside and move after meals, and swap your late-night snack for deep breathing or stretching.\"",
      "When men don\u2019t sleep well, the body produces more cortisol, which is the main stress hormone.",
      "\"High cortisol keeps you locked in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and when you\u2019re in that mode, your body isn\u2019t focused on rest, digest or repair \u2014 it\u2019s focused on survival,\" Gioffre said.",

      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., was ridiculed as \"dishonest\" and \"sick\" after arguing from the House floor that his former law school student and colleague was only \"taking a phone call from her constituent\" when she was texting disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 House hearing.",
      "Republicans on Tuesday, led by Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., introduced a resolution to censure Plaskett for \"inappropriate coordination with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein,\" which it says \"reflects discreditably on the House of Representatives.\"",

      "Hyundai AutoEver America discovered on March 1, 2025, that hackers had compromised its systems. Investigators found the intrusion began on February 22 and continued until March 2.",
      "Hyundai AutoEver America (HAEA) provides IT services for Hyundai Motor America, including systems that support employee operations and certain connected-vehicle technologies. While the company works across Hyundai's broader ecosystem, this incident did not involve customer or driver data.",
      "According to the statement provided to CyberGuy, the breach was limited to employment-related information tied to Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. The company confirmed that about 2,000 current and former employees were notified of the incident in late October.

      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",
      "Experts warn that stolen Social Security and driver\u2019s license information could be used for identity theft and fraud. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Who was affected in the Hyundai AutoEver America data incident",
      "AEA manages select IT systems tied to Hyundai Motor America's employee operations, along with broader technology functions for Hyundai and Genesis across North America. Its role includes supporting connected-vehicle infrastructure and dealership systems.",
      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",
      "GENESIS PREVIEWS G70 SPORTS SEDAN WITH NEW YORK CONCEPT",
      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",
      "We reached out to HAEA for a comment, and a representative for the company provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident. The 2.7 million figure represents the alleged total number of connected vehicles that may be supported by Hyundai AutoEver America across North America. No Hyundai consumer data was exposed, and no Hyundai Motor America customer information or Bluelink driver data was compromised.\"",

    "summary": "Washington court rules automated license plate reader images are public records, even when stored by vendors like Flock Safety, setting precedent for transparency.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",
      "SEATTLE ELECTS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST KATIE WILSON AS MAYOR",
      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington. However, it will also spark fresh conversations about how surveillance tools fit within state records laws.",

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Choose your clinic:\u00a0Gaia partners with more than 100 fertility clinics across the U.S.Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",

      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gaia Family is blending AI and empathy to rewrite how fertility care works. It replaces uncertainty with insight and transforms risk into reassurance. For many, it's not just about technology, it's about restoring hope and fairness to one of life's most personal journeys.",

      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Lawmakers hope clear rules today will make tomorrow\u2019s skyways as safe as the highways below. (Rachel Wisniewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why this bill matters",
      "Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.",
      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",

      "Pennsylvania\u2019s Jetsons Act aims to prepare the state for the future of flying cars before they take off. (CycloTech)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

      "Sen. Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.",

      "The invoice said\u00a0$580.57 would be charged for a two-year Geek Squad subscription, even though I never signed up for one.",
      "These details are meant to create urgency and push you to react before thinking.",
      "BEWARE OF FAKE CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT RESTRICTION SCAMS",
      "This fake Geek Squad invoice looks professional, but small red flags, like a generic greeting, expose the scam. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the scam works",
      "The scam depends on fear and confusion. Once you call the number, the person on the line sounds polite and professional. They might say they need to verify your payment or reverse a charge. In reality, they are trying to get your credit card number or convince you to install software that gives them access to your computer.",
      "In some cases, they claim to refund too much money by accident and ask you to send part of it back. That is how victims lose hundreds or even thousands of dollars.",
      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "Scammers want you to panic and call their number. Remember, real companies never ask for sensitive details over the phone or email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these scam emails look so real",
      "Scammers have refined their tactics. In this Geek Squad scam email I received, they copied the official logo, used clean layouts and included my actual email address to make it look legitimate. They often get this information from\u00a0data leaks or\u00a0security breaches found online.",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) now makes these scams even harder to spot. It helps scammers write natural messages, design fake invoices and create support scripts that sound real. With these tools, they can make almost anyone believe the email is genuine.",
      "Always pause before reacting. Read carefully, check the sender, and question anything that feels suspicious. If you want to stay one step ahead, here are some other things that can help keep you safe.",
      "How to stay safe from scam emails",
      "Scam emails like the fake Geek Squad invoice are becoming more common and more convincing. They use fear and urgency to make you click or call before you think. Protecting yourself means slowing down, verifying every detail and strengthening your digital defenses. Here is how you can stay safe.",
      "The phone number or link in the message connects you directly to scammers, so don't click or call.\u00a0 Once you engage, they can pressure you into sharing personal details or even install harmful software on your device. The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "Scammers often use email addresses that look real but have slight differences, such as extra numbers, misspelled words, or unusual domains. A genuine Geek Squad or Best Buy email will come from @bestbuy.com. Always hover over the sender's name to see the actual address before responding.",
      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical. Real companies do not ask for banking details, gift card payments, or remote access to your computer over the phone. Hang up and contact the company directly through its verified website or customer service number.",
      "Many scams start with stolen or leaked personal data. A data removal service can help delete your information from data broker sites that sell contact lists to marketers and scammers. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for criminals to target you with fake invoices or phishing emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even with precautions, it is smart to monitor your accounts. Check your bank and credit card activity weekly for any charges you do not recognize. If you see something suspicious, contact your financial institution right away to report and dispute the charge.",
      "Two-factor authentication adds another barrier between you and scammers. Even if someone steals your password, they cannot log in without the secondary code sent to your phone or authentication app. Turn on 2FA for your email, online shopping and banking accounts.",
      "Weak or repeated passwords make you an easy target. Create long, unique passwords for each account. A password manager can securely store them and generate complex combinations that are hard to guess or crack.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing. You can also forward the email to reportphishing@apwg.org, which goes to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), or to abuse@bestbuy.com to alert the proper teams.",

      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",

      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 07:15:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Discover how Apple&apos;s passkeys revolutionize Mac security by replacing vulnerable passwords with biometric authentication and encryption for ultimate protection.",
    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",
      "Choose the Apple menu, then select\u00a0System Settings.Click your\u00a0name, then click\u00a0iCloud.Click\u00a0Passwords.

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds another layer of protection to your Apple ID.

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",

Then go to\u00a0System Settings \u2192 Apple ID \u2192 Devices and remove anything you don't recognize. Make sure your trusted phone number is still current, since it's critical for account recovery.",
      "Even though passkeys are replacing passwords, many sites still rely on traditional logins. A password manager helps you create, store and fill in unique passwords for every account. iCloud Keychain can do this automatically across all your Apple devices, but if you want more flexibility, you might want to consider a third-party password manager.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Phishing remains one of the most common ways attackers try to steal personal information. They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Apple regularly releases software updates that include important security patches. Cybercriminals often target outdated systems because they contain known vulnerabilities.

    "story": [
      "Harvard Belfer Center senior fellow Karen Elliott House joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in Washington on Tuesday for his first White House visit in seven years, marking a pivotal moment to rebuild U.S.-Saudi ties and strengthen a partnership that remains central to American security and energy interests.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, a group of 9/11 survivors, first responders and victims\u2019 families urged President Donald Trump to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its alleged role in the 2001 attacks. This follows a United States federal district court judge, George B. Daniels, ruling against Saudi Arabia's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit brought against it by the families of 9/11 victims, which alleged the country was party to the attacks.",
      "The visit comes as Trump has publicly confirmed the United States will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, telling reporters on Monday, \"I will say that we will be doing that. We\u2019ll be selling the F-35s,\" a move that immediately places Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and the region\u2019s future defense architecture at the center of the conversation.",

      "On Monday, President Donald Trump confirmed the U.S. will sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Ali Stewart)",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told Fox News Digital that \"President Trump looks forward to welcoming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the White House, where the two leaders will participate in an official working visit. Thanks to our Dealmaker-in-Chief, the United States secured $600 billion in historic investments during the President\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, and Americans can expect more good deals for our country spanning technology, manufacturing, critical minerals, defense, and more.\"",
      "A senior administration official, speaking on background, told Fox News Digital that the expected agreements will include a multibillion-dollar investment in America\u2019s AI infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and defense sales aimed at strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.",
      "The official added that the visit will also focus on the fulfillment of the Saudis\u2019 $600 billion investment pledge through dozens of targeted investments across key U.S. sectors.",
      "In Saudi Arabia, the visit is being seen as historic. Aziz Alghashian, a lecturer in international relations at Naif Arab University in Riyadh, said there is \"a lot of excitement. The Saudis have said they\u2019re not isolated in the region\u2026 this is back through open doors and the front door again.\" He said the moment reflects a broader shift in how Saudis understand their country\u2019s place in the world. According to Alghashian, Trump\u2019s repeatedly warm comments about the crown prince and the kingdom also contribute to a sense that Riyadh is re-entering Washington on strong footing.",
      "The visit by MBS will be his first White House appearance since the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which U.S. intelligence assessed he approved, a charge he denies.",
      "Jacob Olidort, director for American Security at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that \"Saudi Arabia is one of the top partners of ours in the region,\" calling the trip \"well overdue, a reset of relations.\"",
      "At the heart of the visit is the emerging U.S.-Saudi security pact. Alghashian described its purpose in three words: \"elevate, facilitate and consolidate.\"",
      "In his view, the agreement is meant \"to elevate the Saudi-American relationship,\" transforming it from what he called a \"strategic partnership\" into a more formalized security alignment. Although not a full treaty, which Riyadh had previously pursued, the pact would still represent the most significant upgrade to the relationship in decades. He said the shift also has a domestic political rationale in Washington, arguing that being included in an \"alliance\" category \"helps make Saudi Arabia become more of a bipartisan issue, and not just necessarily a Trump legacy.\"",
      "U.S. and Saudi flags flutter on the major highways of Riyadh ahead of the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 12, 2025. (Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters)",
      "Alghashian added that Saudi Arabia wants to finalize as much as possible now. \"The Saudis\u2026 feel urgency to get as much as they can from the Trump administration before these deals get complicated in the next administration,\" he said.",
      "That urgency extends to nuclear cooperation, where Saudi Arabia has made clear that while China and South Korea exist as alternatives, its preference is for an American program. \"Saudi Arabia really wants American nuclear cooperation because it adds more security,\" he said, adding that Riyadh will not \"wait forever\" if conditions become overly restrictive but sees the current U.S. posture as an opening.",

      "Olidort said Saudi Arabia has been \"very categorical\" in what it expects in a changed Middle East: a defense pact and movement on Palestinian statehood. He recalled hearing a senior Saudi official say recently that \"there will be no regional integration without Palestinian statehood,\" a line that reflects the kingdom\u2019s long-standing public position that recognition of Israel will only come after a credible pathway to a Palestinian state is in place.",
      "Still, Olidort said full Saudi-Israel normalization may not be necessary at this moment for U.S. priorities to advance. He said normalization \"doesn\u2019t need to be the immediate priority\" and suggested that \"an upgraded deepening of cooperation, but short of full normalization,\" could be possible if both sides see value in closer security integration.",
      "TRUMP SECURES DEALS WITH 3 MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS IN 1ST MAJOR TRIP OF 2ND TERM",
      "That perspective is particularly relevant given the war in Gaza and Riyadh\u2019s position on reconstruction. As Alghashian noted, Saudi Arabia has said it \"will not do reconstruction unless Hamas is gone and Israel withdraws,\" a stance that places the kingdom at odds with any rushed postwar plan and, in his view, leaves the region \"in no man\u2019s land.\"",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an official state arrival ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to approve F-35 sales to Saudi Arabia adds another layer. Saudi Arabia has formally requested up to 48 of the fifth-generation jets, making it the largest potential F-35 buyer outside NATO and the first Arab state after the United Arab Emirates to receive them. The move would test Washington\u2019s commitment to maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.",
      "Olidort, however, argued that the sale does not automatically threaten Israel\u2019s superiority. \"I don\u2019t know that it will mean Israel losing air superiority,\" he said, noting that Israel\u2019s defense and aerospace sectors are \"world-class\" and that the sale could \"potentially deepen collaboration between Israel and Saudi Arabia and make each of our partners\u2026 more effective.\"",
      "Beyond defense, the visit is also anchored in technology. Saudi Arabia is pushing for access to advanced American AI chips and positioning itself as a global data and energy hub.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Olidort framed the issue bluntly, saying AI cooperation with Saudi Arabia is a strategic priority for Washington because \"the United States is in \u2018a race\u2019 with China\" and cautioning that \"if we don\u2019t get there, then we will be in a China-dominated AI space.\" That view reflects the broader U.S. assessment that the future of artificial intelligence \u2014 from data-center capacity to semiconductor access \u2014 is inseparable from great-power competition.",

      "A whistleblower who came forward to House Democrats alleging convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell received preferential treatment at a federal prison camp in Texas says she was not motivated by politics.",
      "Instead, \u201cthis was about common human decency and doing what\u2019s right for all inmates,\u201d Noella Turnage, a nurse who worked at Federal Prison Camp Bryan since 2019 until she was fired last week, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "She added that when even one inmate is wrongly retaliated against, \u201cand influence gets another one protected, somebody had to say something.\u201d",
      "Maxwell\u2019s time at FPC Bryan, an all-women\u2019s minimum-security facility, has come under scrutiny since her transfer there in early August from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida. Her relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has become a focal point as Democrats and some Republicans renew their push to compel the Justice Department to make all investigative files surrounding Epstein\u2019s case public.",
      "Turnage said she was not driven by public outrage surrounding Epstein, Maxwell or any other public figures, but acted because she felt \u201cfailed by the institution\u201d when colleagues and others have spoken out about alleged leadership misconduct and retaliation.",
      "She said the federal Bureau of Prisons fired her on Nov. 10. The decision came a day after the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, wrote a letter to President Donald Trump saying they had received information from a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d indicating Maxwell was working on filing a \u201ccommutation application\u201d and receiving special treatment not typically afforded to inmates at Bryan. The information obtained by the House Judiciary Committee included email correspondence that Maxwell sent during her first few months at the prison camp.",
      "Leah Saffian, an attorney for Maxwell, said Friday that employees at FPC Bryan lost their jobs in light of Maxwell\u2019s emails being shared.",
      "There have been employees \u201cterminated for improper, unauthorized access to the email system used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons to allow inmates to communicate with the outside world,\u201d Saffian said in a statement.",
      "NBC News previously reviewed Maxwell\u2019s emails which indicated she was \u201chappier\u201d with her move to a facility that was cleaner and where staff were friendly.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s emails also suggested she had direct access to Bryan\u2019s warden, Tanisha Hall, for help, including arranging visits and communicating with her lawyers \u2014 actions that are highly unusual, other attorneys with clients at the prison say.",
      "The BOP and Hall did not respond to requests for comment about employees terminated in connection with Maxwell.",
      "A spokeswoman for House Judiciary Democrats said Tuesday they would continue to back government employees who claim retaliatory behavior in the workplace in order to shed light on waste, fraud and corruption.",
      "\"Trump's Bureau of Prisons appears to have wrongfully fired an individual for blowing the whistle to Congress on the grotesque pampering of convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Retaliating against whistleblowers is a violation of federal law.\"",
      "Turnage said she was in contact with the House Judiciary Committee after Raskin wrote a letter to Hall on Oct. 30 asking about Maxwell\u2019s perceived \u201cVIP treatment.\u201d",
      "In that letter, Raskin said he was alarmed by news reports that the prison was giving special accommodations to Maxwell\u2019s visitors and other alleged perks, such as meals sent to her dormitory room, late-night workouts and the ability to shower after other inmates were already in bed for the night.",
      "His inquiry also raised other accusations made by inmates that they have been threatened with retaliation if they speak about Maxwell to the media. At least two inmates have been transferred out of Bryan after doing so, according to media reports that reviewed BOP records. NBC News has not confirmed the reason for the transfers.",
      "Turnage and another former Bryan employee, Ashley Anderson, said they spoke with House Democratic committee staff about allegations that BOP policy has been repeatedly violated and retaliation exists against those who report wrongdoing.",
      "Anderson, who had been a senior specialist officer at Bryan for a decade before she was terminated in August, said that she has tried to speak out in support of inmates who\u2019ve reported alleged abuse but that there remain \u201cflaws in a system that often lacks transparency, accountability, and fairness.\u201d",
      "Saffian has called the release of Maxwell\u2019s emails \u201cimproper\u201d and denied that a pardon application had been made to the Trump administration. She also said she would be filing a habeas petition with the Southern District of New York to challenge Maxwell\u2019s 20-year prison sentence for recruiting minors to be sexually abused by Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 During an emotional news conference held hours before the House was set to vote on releasing all of the Jeffrey Epstein files, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said President Donald Trump's handling of the case has been \"destructive\" to his MAGA movement.",
      "\"I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him, for the policies and for America First, and he called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" Greene said, standing beside Epstein victims and families.",
      "\"Let me tell you what a traitor is: A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves,\" she continued, flanked by Epstein survivors. \"A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me.\"",
      "Greene said that the fight over the Epstein files and Trump\u2019s handling of the situation \u201chas been one of the most destructive things to MAGA.\u201d",
      "\u201cWatching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart, and the only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files, and the American people won\u2019t tolerate any other bulls---,\u201d she said.",
      "Reached for comment on the press conference, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, \"Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.\"",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been pushing for the Justice Department to release some of the still-undisclosed Epstein files. Trump has frequently referred to the push to release the files as a \"hoax,\" including during an unrelated White House event on Tuesday.",
      "The House is expected to vote on Tuesday on a bill to compel the Justice Department to release its Epstein files. The bill would still need to pass the Senate. On Monday, Trump said that he would sign the legislation if it passes both chambers of Congress.",
      "Greene, once one of Trump's closest allies, has increasingly drifted away from the president in recent months. The congresswoman has criticized the president's sweeping tariffs and broken with his stance on Israel, referring to the war in Gaza as a \"genocide.\" But the tensions came to a head after Greene began to speak out against the administration's handling of the Epstein case.",
      "Greene was an early vocal supporter of the bipartisan push to force the administration to release the Epstein files. As she continued speaking publicly about the controversy, Trump increasingly lashed out at the congresswoman, ultimately accusing her of complaining too often and referring to her as \"wacky,\" a \"traitor\" and a \"disgrace\" to the GOP.",
      "Greene said on Saturday and Sunday that Trump's attacks on her have resulted in threats to her safety, including a pipe bomb threat. Asked about Greene's claims that she was in danger, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t think her life is in danger. I don\u2019t think, frankly, I don\u2019t think anybody cares about her.\u201d",
      "The debate over the Epstein files has sparked rare divisions among Republican lawmakers, most of whom are typically in lockstep with Trump and the White House.",
      "Throughout Tuesday morning's news conference, Epstein victim also emphasized that the situation should rise above partisan politics.",
      "Jena-Lisa Jones, an Epstein victim, criticized Trump for directing the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's connections with Democrats and others.",
      "\u201cI beg you, President Trump: Please stop making this political,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it. Show some class, show some real leadership, show that you actually care about the people other than yourself.\u201d",
      "She said that she voted for Trump, but called his behavior on the Epstein controversy \"a national embarrassment.\""

      "Gustav Klimt's \"Portrait of Elisabeth Lederer\" sold for an astonishing $236.4 million Tuesday, making it the most expensive auction sale of a work of modern art.",
      "The price also means it is the second-most-valuable work of art that has crossed an auction block.",
      "The sale Tuesday at Sotheby's came from one of the most anticipated art sales in the last several years: the private art collection of Leonard Lauder, the philanthropist, cosmetics heir and legendary collector who helped shape American museums \u2014 much like his mother, Est\u00e9e Lauder, shaped beauty culture as a giant of cosmetics.",
      "The pieces in Tuesday's sale fetched more than a half a billion dollars, with Sotheby's still working to confirm a final number Tuesday night \u2014 and with 30 more lots to be auctioned Wednesday, a spokesperson said.",
      "In addition to the \u201cElisabeth Lederer,\u201d two more majestic Klimt landscapes were for sale: \u201cBlooming Meadow,\u201d estimated at $80 million, created in 1906 at the height of his career, and \u201cForest Slope in Unteach,\u201d estimated at $70 million, painted in 1917. The latter shows a dense forest overlooking the Attersee lake in Austria.",
      "\u201cForest Slope in Unterach on the Attersee\u201d sold Tuesday night for $68 million, and \u201cBlooming Meadow\u201d sold for $86 million. All three works are in pristine condition \u2014 miraculous survivors of persecution, war, transit and time.",
      "Other notable sales included works by Matisse, Van Gogh and Munch. The latter\u2019s \u201cMidsummer Night\u201d crossed the block for $35 million.",
      "Leonard Lauder, who grew up during the Great Depression, died in June at 92, leaving behind some of the most prized artworks in the world. Among the highlights of the 55 works to be auctioned off is the painting that shattered records: the full-length \u201cPortrait of Elisabeth Lederer,\u201d which had an estimated sell price of more than $150 million.",
      "The portrait is historic not only for the high price it brought Tuesday, but also for its rarity. Only two full-length portraits by Klimt are  left in private hands. One is in a private collection that may never come on the market; the other is this one.",
      "Painted between 1914 and 1916, the portrait shows Lederer draped in an imperial Chinese robe, surrounded by Asian motifs and patterns.",
      "\u201cHe elevates her to almost mythical stature,\u201d said Lisa Dennison, Sotheby's executive vice president and chairman of the Americas. \u201cThe sensitivity of the face and the richness of the robe \u2014 it\u2019s regal, transcendent and deeply modern.\u201d",
      "Emily Braun, Lauder\u2019s longtime curator, has held a front-row seat to one of the most remarkable art collectors of our time. Braun said Lauder had a natural eye, \u201cbut he knew he had to study more, to look, constantly and to learn.\u201d",
      "That drive began with his collecting Art Deco hotel postcards as a young boy in Miami, before he moved to wartime propaganda posters and finally to priceless paintings amassed throughout his lifetime. Lauder donated his entire collection of more than 100,000 postcards to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.",
      "Lauder helped the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he started as a member and rose to chairman, acquire 1,000 works \u2014 about one-tenth of its entire collection.",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about quality and legacy,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cIf he believed in something, he wanted it to be the best of the best.\u201d (Lauder was once quoted as saying: \u201cOnly buy the best, don\u2019t be a bottom fisherman.\u201d)",
      "Sotheby\u2019s took over the former Whitney Museum on Manhattan's Madison Avenue, and since its grand opening on Nov. 8, the lines have been snaking around the block for a chance to see rare artworks about to be sold to the highest bidders from all over the world.",
      "Christina Dickerson, a San Francisco resident, comes from an art-collecting family and wanted to see the works in person.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know many people who could amass a collection like this anymore. We\u2019re lucky to see it in one place. The sad part is it\u2019s going to go all over the place, and I truly hope some museums pick it up, so the general public can get to see the art again,\u201d Dickerson said.",
      "The art market has been in a slump recently. Sales in the international high-end art market declined 12% in 2024, according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report.",
      "Lauder may be best known for donating his $1 billion collection of Cubist masterpieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
      "Braun said Lauder\u2019s connection to Klimt was aesthetic, intellectual and deeply personal. Lauder, whose family has Hungarian and Czech heritage, started to collect Klimt\u2019s works in the 1970s. The paintings carried echoes of tragedy, Braun said: Lauder\u2019s wife, Evelyn, fled Vienna as a child because she was Jewish, so the painting's story \u201chad a multilayered meaning for him.\u201d",
      "For decades, the Elisabeth Lederer painting hung above his dining room table.",
      "\u201cPeople were terrified someone might back a chair into it ... but it was never going to happen,\u201d Braun said.",
      "Braun would not reveal how much Lauder paid for the masterpiece in 1985.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s offered 24 works from Lauder\u2019s collection Tuesday with an additional 30 pieces hitting the auction block Wednesday.",
      "In addition to the Klimts, there are glistening Matisse bronzes, Agnes Martin abstractions and a rare Edvard Munch.",
      "\u201cFor Leonard, collecting was never about ownership,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cIt was about preservation, education and beauty \u2014 and this sale is the ultimate expression of that.\u201d"

      "The Texas-born singer, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla P\u00e9rez, found fame singing in both Spanish and English and was known as the Queen of Tejano Music. In March 1995, Selena's life was cut tragically short at age 23 when Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, the former president of her fan club, shot and killed her.",
      "The docuseries, which premiered Nov. 17, explores Selena\u2019s love story with P\u00e9rez, who became a guitarist in her band. Though her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, initially objected to the young lovers\u2019 romance, they secretly eloped in April 1992 and were together until Selena\u2019s death.",

      "When P\u00e9rez, who was already a fan of the band, met Selena in person, he thought she was \u201cbeautiful and talented,\u201d he told  Entertainment Tonight in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m a shy person by nature, and there was something about her that was just able to pull me out,\u201d he said.",
      "The pair\u2019s relationship turned romantic after the band flew to Acapulco, Mexico. While there, P\u00e9rez felt a new closeness and chemistry with the \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom\u201d singer, he explained during a 2021 interview on the \u201cAnything for Selena\u201d podcast.",
      "When their plane began experiencing turbulence, Selena took P\u00e9rez\u2019s hand, he recalled. \u201c(I thought), maybe she was just being (a friend), she knows I\u2019m freaking out from the turbulence ... At the same time, I knew there were sparks,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also recalled worrying about giving into his feelings. \u201cDude, she was like massaging my hand and there I am like, duh, I didn\u2019t know what to think. Add to that, we worked together,\u201d he said.",
      "When Did They Get Married?",
      "The couple initially kept their love affair a secret from Selena\u2019s father but they found it difficult to hide their joy.",
      "\u201cWe were in Laredo when we had our conversation about how we both felt the same way about each other. Selena had the biggest smile on her face when we were walking back to the bus afterward,\u201d P\u00e9rez told Texas Monthly in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m smiling right now just thinking about it. I wanted to tell her, \u2018Hey, quit smiling! You\u2019re going to give it away.\u2019 \u201d",
      "After Abraham Quintanilla found out about the couple\u2019s romance, he kicked P\u00e9rez out of the band despite Selena\u2019s protests.",
      "Selena and P\u00e9rez eloped on April 2, 1992 when Selena was 21, Texas Monthly reported. Abraham Quintanilla told the publication that after P\u00e9rez married his daughter, he \u201caccepted him as part of the family\u201d and allowed him to rejoin Selena\u2019s band. This was also confirmed in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "Following the couple's marriage, Selena began mentioning in public her love for P\u00e9rez. When she accepted the award for female entertainer of the year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards, she acknowledged their love in her speech.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to thank my husband. I love you,\u201d she said.",
      "How Was Chris P\u00e9rez\u2019s Relationship With Selena\u2019s Family After Her Death?",
      "Years after Selena's death, tensions between P\u00e9rez and his father-in-law resurfaced in December 2010 when Abraham Quintanilla sued P\u00e9rez and the media production company Endemol Shine Latino to halt production of a planned Selena bioseries, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "The series was to be based on P\u00e9rez\u2019s 2012 memoir about his late wife, \u201cTo Selena with Love.\u201d",
      "Abraham Quintanilla\u2019s suit stated that his late daughter\u2019s estate, which he controlled, owns \u201call proprietary rights in the name, voice, signature, photograph, and likeness of Selena.\u201d",
      "It further stated, \u201cDefendant P\u00e9rez expressly agreed that he would not exploit any of the Entertainment Properties in any manner or medium, including, without limitation, by way of a book, television series, movie, or any other motion picture medium.\u201d",
      "Five years later, in September 2021, the pair filed a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit, P\u00e9rez revealed.",
      "\u201cGood news! I have amicably resolved my legal dispute with the Quintanilla family,\u201d he tweeted at the time. \u201cNow that these issues are behind us, going forward, my hope, and the hope of the Quintanilla family, is for us to work together to continue to honor and celebrate the legacy of Selena.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez, who appears alongside Selena\u2019s family members in the \u201cSelena y Los Dinos\u201d docuseries, has remained close to his sister-in-law and former bandmate Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "The two posed together under a mural of Selena last month in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cLike everything, family has disagreements about certain things, but we\u2019re past that,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla told E! News this month during a joint interview with P\u00e9rez. \u201cI will always consider Chris family, and I know that he feels the same way about me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re family. We have each other\u2019s back.\u201d",
      "What Has Chris P\u00e9rez Said Recently About Selena?",
      "P\u00e9rez told People in November 2025 that 30 years after his late wife's tragic death, she is always on his mind.",
      "\u201cI think about Selena every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making a decision, I can hear her in my head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know \u2014 are you sure you wanna do that?\u2019",
      "The guitarist said the love he shared with Selena is still precious to him.",
      "\u201cAs time has gone on, you romanticize it even more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe love story is a big part of her legacy. My most prized possessions are her love letters.\u201d He reads one of her letters in \u201cSelena y Los Dinos.\u201d",
      "He added in his People interview that the pain of Selena\u2019s death still haunts him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Chris before all of that happened, and Chris after,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of both sides. I\u2019ve lived with her presence in thoughts and feelings and music. That\u2019s become my new normal. But I can\u2019t watch the end of the documentary about her death. It\u2019s just difficult.\u201d",
      "What Does Chris P\u00e9rez Say About Selena in \u2018Selena y Los Dinos\u2019?",
      "In the Netflix documentary, P\u00e9rez says he was \u201cstarstruck\u201d when he met Selena and her band.",
      "\u201cThe honest truth was I was just more taken aback by the power of the band and the music and the sound,\u201d he said, before touching on his early relationship with Selena. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t hang out too much. Selena was always either off with Suzette or her mom.\u201d",
      "He credited the long tour bus trips to them becoming friends.",
      "\u201cAnytime we were next to each other, it would just be me and her talking about music and movies and things like that,\u201d he said, admiring how it was \u201ccool seeing her being a normal person.\u201d",
      "P\u00e9rez also commented on Selena\u2019s \u201cvulnerable side,\u201d as well as spoke about their trip to Mexico as a band when he started to have stronger feelings for her.",
      "He recalled their first kiss, as well as when their bandmate Ricky Vela walked in on them. P\u00e9rez also said he was \u201cgenuinely in fear\u201d of Selena\u2019s father and what he would say.",
      "\u201cBut what we had going with each other, I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "P\u00e9rez also reads a letter Selena wrote to him before they got married and recalls the moment her dad got upset with him when he found out about their relationship.",
      "Selena\u2019s widow also touches on the day he found out she died.",
      "\u201cI do miss her a lot. But today, I\u2019m very proud of what she represents and the small part that I might play in that story,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "It wasn't until her junior year of college that Nia Sioux realized she was ready.",
      "Then a student at UCLA, she was in Los Angeles with her mom, Holly Frazier. She remembers looking at her and saying, \"I'm ready to write it.\"",
      "She was referring to her long-planned dream of writing a memoir about her time on the Lifetime reality show \"Dance Moms.\" Nia  was just 9 years old in the show's pilot. She and her mom, Holly Frazier, starred in it for seven seasons, from 2011 to 2017.",
      "That dream was actualized with the release of \"Bottom of the Pyramid: A Memoir of Persevering, Dancing for Myself, and Starring in My Own Life,\" which hit shelves Nov. 4.",
      "\"I always knew I was going to write a book about my time on 'Dance Moms,'\" Nia tells TODAY.com. \"But it's ever really been the right time. It never really felt right. I don't even think I was really comfortable talking about everything that happened on the show. I was still processing it.\"",
      "The book opens with her casting on the show, and each chapter unveils her side of some of the show's controversial moments, often with her dance teacher and the show's star, Abby Lee Miller, at the center of it. She alleges Miller made racist comments directed at her, tried to bribe a mentor to not work with Nia and most recently, refused Nia's request to visit Miller in the hospital to clear the air after she was diagnosed with cancer. (TODAY.com has reached out to Miller for comment.)",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com after the publication of the memoir, Nia confirms she hasn't heard from Miller about the book.",
      "\"I don't plan on getting anything either,\" Nia says. \"Yeah, no.\"",
      "But bringing that to light isn\u2019t why Nia wrote the book. In the memoir, she writes that after her request to meet was declined, she\u2019ll \u201cnever reach out to Abby Lee Miller again.\u201d She adds that she \u201cdidn\u2019t even want to use her name\u201d in the book.",
      "\"After I had a lot of space away from the show, I realized that that woman really does not have power over me. She really can't dictate my life and control things, and for so long, she made it seem like she controlled the world and she controlled my future,\" Nia says. \"I think having that space away from the show and realizing, like, oh my gosh, actually, she doesn't exist in my world. I can do my own thing and be successful ... and she's not going to get in the way of that.\"",
      "The book seeks to establish Nia as the \"star in my life.\"",
      "Its overarching theme is ironically best described by the title. The bottom of the pyramid, of course, refers to \"Dance Moms'\" episode's fixture in which Miller would rank each dancer in a tiered pyramid based on their performance at their most recent competition.",
      "Fans of the show may remember that typically Nia was toward the bottom, while the coveted top of the pyramid spot was most often dominated by Maddie Ziegler.",
      "\"My dad, at first, was a little concerned. He loved the title, but he also was concerned with it, because I've been trying to kind of shed that title my whole life,\" Nia says. \"So he was like, 'Why would you name your book \"Bottom of the Pyramid\"? Isn't that kind of putting yourself down?'",
      "\"I was like, 'No, it's basically me just reclaiming that title and turning it into a positive,'\" she adds.",
      "For example, she writes in the book, as the bottom of the pyramid she served as her team's base, its glue. And \"at the bottom, the only place you can go is up.\"",
      "\"I'm not shying away from it. I'm not embarrassed by it. I'm just ready to talk,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "But that doesn't mean it was easy. She says the most difficult part was \"trying to tell my story\" while \"not trying to put other people down.\"",
      "\"Anytime I do bring up the girls and situations, I think that part was the hardest for me to write because I never want to paint them in a bad light,\" she says. \"But it's still my experience, and it's still very valid.",
      "\"My relationship with the show was very complicated,\" she adds. \"Although there were times where it was really negative and really challenging, at the same time, it's how I got my start. It's something that is a part of me, and it's something I'm still grateful for, with the good and the bad.\"",
      "Below, Nia discusses how she approached writing the memoir, how some of her fellow castmates have reacted and why the book feels like \"closure\" for the \"Dance Moms\" chapter of her life.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "The hardest part for me was making sure that I wrote everything in the way that I wanted it to be taken. I think that it's really difficult to talk about these sort of things because I come from a place of, you know, I'm healed. I always lead with love. At the same time, I'm not trying to put people down or badmouth anybody. So, trying to find that delicate balance between sharing my story, but (I'm) still not here to protect people. People have been protected this whole time. It was time for me to share my story. And I think that was the hardest part for me, is being OK sharing my story without being worried about what other people thought.",
      "I always knew that I endured a lot. But I feel like every time I read through the book to make my edits and add things, omit things, every single time something came up. Every single time I think I cried in different moments. It's really healing to see your whole story as something tangible, as a book. Literally reading your whole life \u2014\u00a0it's very therapeutic. It's basically my diary; it's like my journal. But it's been so healing. And I think that's the thing that I was so surprised about. It did bring up emotions. I was like, you know what, this might be hard for me to write, and there were times that were hard to write, but for the most part, it was just so healing.",
      "I did. Not every single episode, but the parts that I talk about in the book, I watched it back. I remember things a certain way, and I know how things went down, but I also needed to see how they played out on television to see what the world saw. Sometimes it was the same thing that I remembered. ... But there were a lot of things also that I remember that did happen that the show either cut out or they clipped a certain way.",
      "That was kind of weird, because in my head, I'm like, \"Oh, I thought people knew this.\" I thought it played out this way, but actually, they didn't show any of the stuff I actually went through that week. So watching it back, I mean, I did honestly get irritated at times. I'm like, \"Oh my goodness, they didn't show any of that.\" Watching it, what, 14, 13 years later, having that realization is kind of crazy.",
      "I think I watched the first few episodes of it. When it first came out we had our launch party. ... We watched the first episode when it came on, and I think maybe I probably watched the next couple.",
      "But if I'm being honest, no. One because I don't want to re-live that, I know what happens. But then also, too, I honestly really couldn't. We had no time to even watch anything. The time that the show came out, Tuesdays at 9, we literally had dance. I was at dance while the show was coming out. I would get home and the credits would be rolling. So yeah, even if I wanted to, I couldn't, really.",
      "Chloe did read it before it came out, but I didn't really talk to anyone else about the book before I announced that I was doing it. Chloe was my main girl for that because I knew that she would one, be understanding, and also I really wanted her to write the forward. And she was so excited about it. It was a very special moment when I asked her. I had her obviously read the book before she committed to writing the forward as well. Because, of course, I wanted her to be comfortable with what she was endorsing. She's been so great during this whole process, and I'm really proud of her. And I also know that she's proud of me, and it's been a very special journey.",
      "My mom, actually both my parents, would read chapters as they were done. Any parts I had done, I would have my parents read it, because I value their opinion a lot. They watched every episode and they were the adults, so they would probably remember more than me at times, and then remind me of things. That really helped, trying to get different points of view, making sure that I don't forget the little things.",
      "The book definitely feels like closure. I think before I wrote the book, I had definitely moved on. But I don't know if I really had closure with it because I had never talked about my experience. Not many people actually heard from me when it came to \"Dance Moms.\" So this really was healing. This really was closure. And I also say, this book is also a love letter to my younger self.",
      "Honestly, I feel like there hasn't been a ton from the cast members, reaction-wise. So I don't know whether that's good or bad, but like, I haven't seen too much about that. But I'm grateful for the people that have supported me. Grateful for my mom continuing to support me, grateful for Chloe.",
      "... Having her support means the absolute world because I know that I don't have support from everyone. So it's nice to have somebody, especially Chloe, be so supportive of my story.",
      "Well, my biggest dream is one, to help people. That's what I feel like is my mission, just to help people in any way I can. But also I'm a performer at the end of the day, so storytelling, in any way possible, whether that's through dance, music, acting, theater. Theater was my first love besides dance. So hopefully \u2014 well, not hopefully, I am \u2014\u00a0I'm going to dive back into all of those things.",
      "Now that I'm done with college and now I'm done writing the book and it's released now, I can finally focus on getting back into the swing of things. Before I went to college, I was kind of on a roll, and then I went to college, COVID happened, the actors strike happened. So a lot of things have changed within the past five years. So I'm excited to get back to it. I've been craving getting back to performing, getting back on stage, in any capacity."

Upon the news of Courteney\u2019s firing, Tammy does not follow her to Oklahoma, but rather, smiles with glee any time she hears of Courteney\u2019s struggles.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time the writers collaborated with Chenoweth. Jeff Astrof co-created the NBC legal sitcom \u201cTrial & Error\u201d with Matt Miller back in 2017, which Chenoweth starred in. When it came to the role of Tammy, the siblings knew it had to be Chenoweth.",

      "After working as the head of Selena\u2019s fan club and overseeing her two clothing boutiques, Sald\u00edvar was fired in early 1995 when the singer\u2019s family accused her of embezzling money from the fan club and boutiques, according to NBC News.",
      "Selena's widower, Chris P\u00e9rez, testified in court that he and Selena had removed Sald\u00edvar from the singer\u2019s checking accounts because they \u201cdidn\u2019t trust her,\u201d according to a court document from the Texas Court of Appeals from 1998, when Sald\u00edvar unsuccessfully appealed her murder conviction.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of things that were coming up, you know, unaccounted for, and we couldn\u2019t get an explanation that we were satisfied with for some of those things,\u201d P\u00e9rez told prosecutor Carlos Valdez, according to the 1998 court document.",

      "Selena collapsed in the motel lobby, and was able to identify Sald\u00edvar as the person who had shot her before passing out, according to the 1998 court document.",
      "Then, for more than nine hours, Sald\u00edvar sat in her truck in the motel parking lot and threatened to commit suicide, the same court document states. After hours of conversation with a hostage negotiation team, she surrendered to police.",

      "\u201cAfter a thorough consideration of all available information, which included any confidential interviews conducted, it was the parole panels determination to deny parole to Yolanda Saldivar and set her next parole review for March 2030,\u201d the board said in a statement.",
      "The statement continued, \u201cThe reason provided by the panel for denial was the Nature of the Offense: The record indicates that the instant offense has elements of brutality, violence, assaultive behavior or conscious selection of victim\u2019s vulnerability indicating a conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others, such that the offender poses a continuing threat to public safety.\u201d",
      "What Has Yolanda Sald\u00edvar Said About Selena in the Past?",
      "Sald\u00edvar has said that she did not deliberately kill Selena.",
      "\u201cThey made me out to be a monster, and I just want to say, I did not kill Selena. It was an accident, and my conscience is clear,\u201d she said in a 1995 interview with ABC\u2019s \u201c20/20.\u201d",
      "In the same interview, Sald\u00edvar offered her version of what happened the day Selena died.",
      "Sald\u00edvar claimed she and Selena were having a dispute at the Days Inn motel and that in a heated moment, she (Sald\u00edvar) put a gun to her head and threatened to take her own life. Sald\u00edvar claimed that she then waved her gun in the direction of the door, and accidentally shot Selena.",
      "The prosecutor in the singer\u2019s trial argued that Selena\u2019s killing was not accidental, according to the 1998 court document.",
      "In an interview with \u201cBehind the Music\u201d in 1998, Sald\u00edvar opened up about her relationship with Selena throughout the early \u201890s, and explained why she had founded a fan club devoted to the singer.",
      "\u201cGoing through my college years, I had no social life. I had none because I devoted myself to my university, my career, my license,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it was time for me to have fun.\u201d",
      "Selena\u2019s father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., also shared his earlier memories of Sald\u00edvar in the \u201cBehind the Music\u201d special.",
      "\u201cAt one time, my whole family liked Yolanda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would invite her to come eat at our house. We\u2019d have a get together, and we\u2019d invite her.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar said her connection to Selena \u201chad grown from being just a fan-celebrity type to this personal type of relationship.\u201d",
      "In her 1995 \u201c20/20\u201d interview, she also said that Selena sometimes even called her \u201cmom.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was like a cuddly bear, teddy bear, that \u2014 she would allow you to love her,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said. \u201cI told her that I loved her like a daughter. And she goes, \u2018You know, I give you that right.\u2019 She would call me \u2018mom\u2019 on the phone.\u201d",
      "The singer\u2019s family questioned whether Selena ever called Sald\u00edvar \u201cmom,\u201d according to \u201c20/20.\u201d",
      "In the 2024 trailer for the Oxygen documentary \u201cSelena & Yolanda: The Secrets Between Them,\u201d Sald\u00edvar seemed to suggest that she has previously undisclosed information to share about the circumstances of Selena's death. (Oxygen is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of TODAY.com.)",
      "\u201cMy family gathered the evidence, showed different versions of what was going on,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in the trailer.",
      "What Did Yolanda Sald\u00edvar Say in the Oxygen Docuseries?",
      "The three-part series, which aired in Feb. 2024, featured new interviews with Sald\u00edvar, as well as interviews with prosecutors, the hostage negotiator who spoke to Sald\u00edvar after Selena\u2019s death, and police detectives who were on the scene in the aftermath of the murder, according to Oxygen.",
      "In the series, Sald\u00edvar claimed she did not intentionally kill Selena and dismissed the long-held theory that she was embezzling money. Instead, Sald\u00edvar alleged that Selena was having an extramarital affair and tasked Sald\u00edvar with making purchases on her behalf to help cover up the tryst. Sald\u00edvar said she was simply paying herself back and that Selena was aware. But in the docuseries, Sald\u00edvar did not provide any evidence to substantiate her claims.",
      "\u201cAfter so many years, I think it\u2019s time to set the story straight,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said in a trailer for the series.",
      "\u201cI knew her secrets,\u201d Sald\u00edvar said later in the trailer. \u201cAnd I think that people deserve to know the truth.\u201d",
      "Selena\u2019s family slammed the docuseries for giving Sald\u00edvar a platform.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2019s gonna believe what she has to say anyway. Everyone knows there\u2019s zero truth to anything that comes out of her mouth,\u201d Abraham Quintanilla Jr. told TMZ.",
      "Selena\u2019s family declined to participate in the docuseries. At the time of its release, NBC News reached out to the family\u2019s spokesperson, as well as Abraham Quintanilla Jr. directly, for comment regarding Sald\u00edvar\u2019s claims."

      "Thirty years ago when Selena Quintanilla died, the world lost a rising star \u2014 and a groundbreaking artist.",
      "The Mexican American singer, known as the Queen of Tejano music, was just 23 years old when she was murdered by the president of her fan club and employee Yolanda Sald\u00edvar in 1995.",
      "The Texas native captivated audiences in the U.S. and Latin America with her hits \u201cComo La Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido\u201d and \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom.\u201d Her signature red lips, long black hair,  sultry voice and beloved dance moves have become iconic for fans of the late artist.",
      "Many who were unfamiliar with Selena during the height of her fame became aware of her extraordinary talent when Jennifer Lopez portrayed her in the 1997 biopic, \u201cSelena.\u201d",
      "Now, for the first time since Selena\u2019s death, her family is sharing never-before-seen footage from their archives of the superstar and her rise to fame in Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelena Y Los Dinos,\u201d streaming now.",
      "\u201cYou get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists,\u201d director Isabel Castro tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that, in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice.\u201d",

The band included her sister playing drums and her brother playing bass, backing vocals and writing songs, along with a slew of band members like Ricky Vela and Pete Astudillo. Her future husband later joined the group as a guitarist.",
      "\u201cI understand what Selena and her legacy represent even now, 30 years later,\u201d Suzette Quintanilla tells TODAY.com \u201cAnd I also know that's growing.\u201d",
      "Below, Suzette Quintanilla and Isabel Castro chat with TODAY.com about the decades of footage they combed through for this project \u2014 and the painful emotions and moments of joy that resurfaced after 30 years.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Suzette Quintanilla: I had reached out to Isabel about two years ago or so. With social media, things get blurred, and stories get told one way \u2014 and then they start changing. I wanted to be able to take our family story and what we created as a whole... and bring it to 2025, leaving this really nice capsule of our story, told by \u2014 who better than our family?",
      "That\u2019s pretty much why I wanted to do this, and I thought maybe sharing some footage of us back in the day would be really good. Isabel has a fun story about how I let her into the vault. We call it the vault at the office, but it's basically where we keep all our footage.",
      "Isabel Castro: The vault is actually the perfect way to describe it, but it's floor to ceiling bookcases with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of VHS tapes, beta cam, film, CDs, flash drives.",
      "We spent two years going through all of that, logging everything, digitizing everything, watching every single thing. We watched every single piece of footage.",
      "SQ: I didn't feel differently. If anything, it gave me that good feeling of how life was. I was telling Isabel, like, \u201cOh, my God, I saw some of the footage, and I remember I was whistling when she bought those shoes\u201d or...different little key moments like clothing. Because we were sisters, we would shop a lot together.",
      "But what I did walk away with was, I had a really good feeling of like, \u201cWow, I know we worked really hard.\u201d It was a reminder of what we did come from, which was nothing, and that we created something memorable that still resonates with people. I\u2019m very grateful that our music is still relevant to this day.",
      "One of the things that I\u2019m really proud about this documentary is it truly tells and showcases the importance of each one of us and what we bring to our band. Yes, clearly Selena was a star and she was the forefront of our band. But there were other main factors that made our vision. I think that Isabel was able to really showcase the magnitude of what we each brought, and that\u2019s why we are here talking about our documentary.",
      "IC: That was one of the main goals of the film, to obviously explain how Selena became the symbol and the icon. But the film itself, I wanted it to feel as personal and as close to the family as possible, because my theory was that that was going to be what made it different from anything that had been made before. That was our North Star in the editorial process: to try to find ways to really make it as personal as possible.",
      "There's so many decisions that went into trying to cultivate that intimacy. We filmed people in spaces that they spent a lot of time in so they felt really comfortable. We didn't clean up the archive, we made sure that the edges and the glitches and the focusing of the camera and zooming in and out, those things were all kind of integrated into the editing process. And though these seem just like creative elements, they lend itself to the film feeling as if you're getting to know a more personal side of Selena.",
      "The other thing is that you get to hear from Selena herself. We went through every single interview that we could find and that exists. We transcribed every single interview and we wanted to hear as much from Selena throughout the film as possible because we felt that in that way, we would be telling the story in her voice as well.",
      "SQ: We\u2019ve never tried romanticizing anything about our life, I don\u2019t know if everybody else might have done that. But in regards to what we have always done is just kept it real. Isabel had so many things to go through to be able to create and integrate Selena into this film because that\u2019s the heart of this whole documentary. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s stripped down. There\u2019s no romanticizing going on. It\u2019s just who she was.",
      "What's relevant is, whenever you see an interview of her, she'll say something and she just starts laughing at herself. Most artists don\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll be like, \u201cNo, don\u2019t show that.\u201d And for her, she didn\u2019t care. It was just her being real. And I think that\u2019s one of the main beauties of this documentary. This is us talking about our life. We\u2019re not holding back, and I think that Isabel did an amazing job putting that all together and telling our story. And hopefully this will resonate for another 30, 40, years after I\u2019m no longer here. I hope it inspires.",
      "Another main reason is that I wanted to leave something behind. Selena was a beacon and I see her as that as well. People still look up to her and they admire her. I hope that after seeing this documentary, they walk away with that same mindset that their dream is attainable.",
      "SQ: I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s kind of hard to say. I know that whatever she would have done, she would have been at the forefront of whatever she did. I think she would still be a beacon no matter whatever she did if she was still here and a complete role model. I do 100% believe if she was still here, she would be kicking ass in the design world and a designer.",
      "SQ: Every once in a while when I\u2019m in front of a live band, yeah, I want to play. But for the most part, I\u2019m at ease with that and I\u2019m fine with it because I keep myself so busy on the business side of everything. But I do miss it and I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t.",
      "SQ: I\u2019m going to be very real with you. At the beginning, it was very, extremely difficult to live without her, hands down. I didn\u2019t think I would still be here, to be honest with you, that\u2019s how much grief took over. And then at one point I realized, after a couple of years of being in this mindset of feeling numb, so to speak, I realized that I needed to come out of it.",
      "I didn\u2019t go to therapy because back then, you know how (some) Mexican  (families) are. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in therapy.\u201d It\u2019s more like, \u201cCome and talk to your tia (aunt) type of therapy.\u201d But one thing I did is I prayed to God every day just to get me through that one day. That\u2019s it. Not the week, not the month, one day. And it just happened like that. And at one point, I started to let go of anger that I had in my heart for the person who took her life. Let go of things that I had no control over. Stay away from the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d What if she was still here, what if she wouldn\u2019t have gone? What if? It doesn\u2019t matter because at the end of the day, the what ifs always brought me back around to the same thing: She is still not here.",
      "I went through this transition of healing my heart and my soul. It's still broken and it will forever be broken, and that's life. I'll probably go home, I\u2019ll go back to the hotel, probably have a good cry because I\u2019m going down memory lane today, but it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a good cry and there\u2019s nothing wrong with crying here and there.",
      "I do miss her tremendously, but I'm in a place where we're celebrating not just Selena, but what we accomplished as a whole and as a family. That's what this documentary is about. I hope that my words resonate because what we can only do is celebrate the ones that are no longer with us anymore and keep their memory present."

      "Brendan Fraser is a lonely, struggling actor just trying to find a real connection in his new movie, \u201cRental Family.\u201d",
      "Set in modern-day Tokyo, the forthcoming comedic drama follows the Oscar winner\u2019s character, Phillip, who has been taking odd jobs in hopes of landing his big break. However, his life completely changes when he books one unusual role with a company: a Japanese \u201crental family\u201d agency where paid actors pose as family members, friends and romantic partners, among other roles, for specific situations.",
      "Ahead of the film\u2019s Nov. 21 release, TODAY.com has an exclusive clip of Phillip learning about all the ways being part of a rental company can make a difference.",
      "\u201cSo what do you think we do?\u201d Shinji (Takehiro Hira) asks Phillip at his office.",
      "\u201cYou, if I have to guess, you sell people,\u201d Phillip replies with a hesitant laugh.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Shinji says. \u201cWe sell emotion. We play roles in a client\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "When Phillip says the agency can\u2019t \u201creplace someone in your life,\u201d Shinji disagrees.",
      "\u201cYes and no,\u201d he responds before adding, \u201cbut people are willing to take a leap.\u201d Shinji notes the many ways actors can fill in for others. \u201cThe actor, the surrogate \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be that person. You just have to help clients connect to what\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "So why would the company need someone like Phillip? Well, as Shinji explains, they \u201cneed a token white guy.\u201d",
      "When Phillip appears doubtful, Shinji adds that he\u2019s giving him an opportunity, as an actor, to \u201cplay roles with a real meaning.\u201d",
      "Directed and co-written by Hikari, \u201cRental Family\u201d examines human connection, as well as the moral complexities that Phillip begins to feel once he starts working with the company.",
      "\u201cRental Family\u201d is loosely based on the real-life Japanese rental family businesses throughout the country.",
      "Hikari tells TODAY.com that when she first heard of the services, she discovered \u201cthat people are really longing for connection\u201d amid feelings of isolation.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to make a movie that connects the audience,\u201d she shares. \u201cAnd have them look within themselves or pick up the phone and say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d"

      "Powell, who stars in the new film \u201cThe Running Man,\u201d made his \u201cSNL\u201d hosting debut Nov. 15 alongside musical guest Olivia Dean.",
      "During his opening monologue, Powell recalled how he was supposed to host the late-night sketch comedy show four years ago to promote \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d but his plans were thwarted by a pushed release date for the film.",
      "\u201cWhen I got the call, I was on a porch with my family and we all just lost our minds,\u201d Powell explained. \u201cWe were jumping up and down celebrating, and a UPS driver happened to be delivering a package at that exact same moment and he was like, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d",
      "Powell explained to the UPS driver that he had gotten the call to host \u201cSNL\u201d and told the driver to tune in for the Christmas episode that season.",
      "\u201cAnd so we all took a selfie with him, and this is the selfie to mark the occasion,\u201d Powell said, before showing a photo posing with the UPS driver as well as his parents and sisters. \u201cSo that\u2019s me and my whole family and the UPS driver.\u201d",
      "However, Powell said his \u201cdream got taken away\u201d after the \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d release was delayed due to the pandemic, and \u201cSNL\u201d rescinded the offer for him to host.",
      "Powell joked that the show\u2019s creator and producer, Lorne Michaels, called him and told him that without \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d nobody \u201cwill know who the eff you are.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t end up hosting, which means for four years, this UPS driver was just going around saying Glen Powell is a liar,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo now, I am here hosting. It feels amazing. But what feels even better is proving to this UPS driver that I am not crazy.\u201d",
      "In a surprise twist, Powell then shared that his sisters, Lauren and Leslie, were able to track down the UPS driver, joking that the women in his family \u201care terrifying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey found the cell number of this UPS guy, his name is Mitch,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo to prove to Mitch that I am not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York \u2014 coach, I don\u2019t know how \u2018The Running Man\u2019 is going to do yet \u2014 but I flew him here, and he thought it was a scam, but he still came. And he is sitting in the audience tonight, so let\u2019s give it up for Mitch, the UPS guy.\u201d",
      "The camera panned to Mitch sitting in the audience as he gave a wave to the camera. Powell then invited Mitch onto the stage of Studio 8H to re-create that original selfie and \u201cbring this thing full circle.\u201d",
      "While this marked Powell\u2019s first time hosting the late-night sketch comedy show, the actor made two brief appearances in March 2024 during his \u201cAnyone But You\u201d co-star Sydney Sweeney\u2019s hosting debut.",
      "During her monologue, Sweeney called out the \u201ccraziest rumor\u201d she\u2019d heard about herself online, which was that she and Powell had an affair while they filmed the 2023 rom-com. Sweeney refuted the rumors and said her then-fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Davino, produced the movie and he was with the duo the entire time during filming.",
      "Sweeney added that Davino was in the audience to show his support. But the cameras cut to Powell smiling in the audience, leaving Sweeney to yell, \u201cThat\u2019s not my fianc\u00e9! He\u2019s in my dressing room!\u201d",
      "Powell also appeared during a sketch called \u201cLoud Table,\u201d which featured Sweeney on a date with her boyfriend, played by Andrew Dismukes. However, during the date, Sweeney confessed she cheated on him with her boss, played by none other than Powell."

    "story": [
      "In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from President Donald Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the killing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in response to questions from a journalist about Khashoggi. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t like that gentleman that you\u2019re talking about. Whether you like him or didn\u2019t like him, things happen, but [the crown prince] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Trump began his remarks by saying that he was proud of the crown prince in \u201cterms of human rights and everything else.\u201d",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government. At the time, Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.",
      "Trump lashed out at a reporter from ABC News who asked the crown prince about Khashoggi's death and about criticism from the families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, many of whom have long pushed for answers on the Saudi government's potential ties to the attackers.",
      "\"ABC, fake news, one of the worst, one of the worst in the business,\" he said.",
      "The crown prince dismissed the criticisms against the Saudi government as part of a campaign to drive a wedge between Washington and Riyadh.",
      "\"I feel painful about, you know, families of 9/11 in America,\" he said. \"But you know, we have to focus on reality.\"",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed also defended the kingdom\u2019s probe into Khashoggi's murder, which he said included internal reforms. A Saudi court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in the killing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said, promising that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "Hanan Elatr Khashoggi, the journalist's widow, responded to Trump on X, writing, \"There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press. The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.\"",
      "The crown prince said in 2019 that he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch but denied having ordered it.",
      "Khashoggi's death has highlighted the risks journalists face around the world, particularly in areas where there is conflict. A report from the Committee to Protect Journalists released in February said that at least 124 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024, mainly Palestinian journalists killed as a result of Israel's military offensive in Gaza.",
      "The crown prince's trip Tuesday will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of figure now. Obviously, the questions about the manner of his rule and internal repression, those things haven\u2019t gone away. But he\u2019s a changed figure; it\u2019s a changed moment. And, I think, important symbolically in that sense,\u201d said Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit organization based in Brussels that works to prevent conflicts.",
      "He added: \u201cHe\u2019s central to what this administration wants to do in the region.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s welcome of the crown prince was an elaborate display of pomp and circumstance. After arriving at the White House, the crown prince was greeted by a military flyover of stealth fighter jets, officers on horseback and a tour of the Rose Garden from Trump. Later, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised the reception that he received when he visited the kingdom this year. \u201cI love the country and people,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump and the crown prince joked about investing $1 trillion \u2014 a sum roughly equal to Saudi Arabia's entire wealth fund \u2014 into the United States, up from a $600 billion pledge.",
      "The two leaders are also expected to sign economic and defense agreements, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "Even before the crown prince had set foot in the United States, Trump confirmed at an Oval Office event Monday that he would be willing to sign off on the sale of F-35 stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, a contentious move that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East, where Israel has been the primary recipient of America\u2019s cutting-edge military technology. Trump repeated the pledge Tuesday and promised a deal.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement of the sale may not actually lead to Saudi Arabia receiving the F-35s anytime soon, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThe devil will kind of be in the details there,\u201d said Andrew Leber, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has done extensive research on Saudi Arabia, noting that a similar deal announced with the United Arab Emirates fell through.",
      "He added, \u201cThat deal ultimately ran aground on a combination of U.S. concerns with maintaining Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge and concerns about the extent to which U.S. security technology might leak to China.\u201d",
      "Trump designated Saudi Arabia a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\" on Tuesday, noting that the classification would take the country\u2019s military cooperation with the United States \u201cto even greater heights.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou always had a little cloud over your head, and sometimes that cloud was very big. That cloud is not there anymore, and we want to keep it that way,\u201d Trump said before he announced the designation at a dinner honoring Crown Prince Mohammed.",
      "Major Non-NATO Ally status is a designation that \u201cprovides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation,\u201d according to the State Department. It does not, however, require U.S. security commitments to such countries.",
      "The possibility of Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel is a key part of the talks. \u201cI already brought it up,\" Trump said when asked about the prospect of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords, the 2020 U.S.-brokered agreement that led a number of regional countries to establish formal diplomatic ties with Israel. \"I don\u2019t want to use the word 'commitment,' but we had a good talk,\" he said.",
      "Analysts have been skeptical about a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no near-term horizon for normalization at the moment,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "\"The risks for Mohammed bin Salman are extremely high if he joins the Abraham Accords,\" agreed Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. He noted that Saudi Arabia had made clear it would need some form of Israeli commitment to a path to a Palestinian state \u2014 something Israel has publicly dismissed.",
      "The crown prince's strategy was generally \"to minimize the risks to his rule,\" Gerges said.",
      "Even if the crown prince does not announce the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel, he has won favor with Trump as one of the regional leaders who helped pull together the current ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Trump has long touted his deal-making abilities and, according to a senior administration official, a number of deals are expected to be announced Tuesday, including a multibillion-dollar Saudi investment in America\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure, enhanced cooperation on civil nuclear energy and fulfillment of the Saudis' $600 billion investment pledge via dozens of targeted investments.",
      "Critics have raised questions about Trump\u2019s affinity for mixing personal business and diplomacy. His properties have for years hosted tournaments for the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. And The New York Times reported this weekend that the Trump Organization is looking at a huge real estate deal with Saudi Arabia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some massive ethical questions in here,\u201d Leber of the Carnegie Endowment said. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that all of the Gulf states have realized that the way you get to Trump is to find some way to enrich his family members, enrich his friends, promise to enrich them down the line.\u201d",
      "Trump, asked about his family\u2019s business ties to Saudi Arabia, said they \u201cdo business all over,\u201d and that he's no longer involved in the activities.",
      "Governments dealing with Saudi Arabia, human rights groups have long said, should also push the country\u2019s leaders on its dismal human rights record. In August, a report from Human Rights Watch noted an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d in executions in 2025, with 241 people put to death as of Aug. 5.",
      "Still, the restrictions on women, another regular criticism leveled at the kingdom, have been eased, and the crown prince has tried to open up the society to Western exports, like Ultimate Fighting Championship matches and comedy shows, though the comedians who recently appeared at a comedy festival in Riyadh, including Louis C.K. and Bill Burr, were blasted for performing there.",
      "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been political reform in the sense of creating space for real politics, but he\u2019s absolutely, fundamentally reoriented Saudi society and changed the role of the religious authorities,\u201d Hanna of the ICG said. \u201cThere\u2019s incredible social change that has happened partly because he\u2019s operating without any real constraints.\""

    "story": [
      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, this was \"one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,\" a \"moment of true historic proportion\" that would \" lead to further peace all over the world.\" But the gravity of the U.N. Security Council's endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions Tuesday over how it will actually work.",
      "Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of the conflict \u2014 the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves \u2014 actually support its end goals.",
      "Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively giving Trump free rein over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but he previously said he rejects its talk of \"Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\"",
      "On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-nonexistent bodies, including the \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d headed by Trump and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.",
      "That having been said, this was a rare moment of geopolitical unity.",
      "Trump's team won the support of Arab states by inserting language hinting at a future Palestinian state, and Russia and China abstained from the vote rather than use their vetoes to torpedo the proposal outright.",
      "It passed 13-0.",
      "Summarizing the mood Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the vote as \"an important step\" but cautioned that it was \"essential now to translate the diplomatic momentum into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "It's a sentiment shared by many observers.",
      "Frank Lowenstein, former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama, told NBC News that passing the resolution was \"essential\" for Trump's proposal.",
      "\"There was no way this Trump plan could possibly work without a U.N. Security Council resolution,\" he said. Not only will it impart \"the credibility and the legitimacy and the clear support of the international community,\" but it also \"provides an opportunity to begin creating a new reality, to begin moving forward with the process in a way that will give people hope.\"",
      "He cautioned, however, that the resolution's passage was \"nowhere near sufficient,\" principally because the U.N. has no enforcement mechanism, and that Hamas immediately rejected the ISF.",
      "The resolution claims \"the parties\" to the conflict \"have accepted it.\" But it's not clear that is the case.",
      "The main Palestinian governmental body, the Palestinian Authority, said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed the resolution and expressed its \"full readiness to cooperate\" with the United States and its backers.",
      "But Hamas, the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the agreement did not meet the \"political and humanitarian demands and rights\" of the Palestinian people.",
      "The Palestinian militant-political group, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and would be disarmed under the deal, said in a statement that the mandate the resolution grants to the ISF to use force \u201cstrips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favor of the occupation.\u201d",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for a response to those criticisms.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump and \"his tireless and devoted team,\" saying he believed the plan \"will lead to peace and prosperity because it insists upon full demilitarization, disarmament and the deradicalization of Gaza.\"",
      "But just a day earlier, he had firmly rejected the resolution\u2019s call for \u201ca pathway towards Palestinian self-determination and eventual statehood,\u201d under pressure from his far-right coalition partners.",
      "Even putting those differences to one side, there are big question marks about how the basics of this plan will work in practice.",
      "\u201cThere is a genuine sense of relief that we are moving forward to diplomacy,\u201d said Nimrod Goren, the president of the Mitvim Institute, a progressive Israeli think tank.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not really clear where all this is headed,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat is the commitment of the leaders, the motivations of those behind it? And can it actually lead us away from the status quo in which Hamas still controls part of Gaza and Israel controls other parts around it?\u201d",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump said members of the Board of Peace would be named in the coming weeks \u2014 having previously said British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be involved \u2014 and to expect \"many more exciting announcements.\"",
      "Goren said: \"There are all kinds of new terminology and mechanisms that do not yet exist. So there are a lot of question marks on the basic premises: What is their mandate? How will they be set up?\"",
      "Indonesia, one of the backers of the U.S. proposal, says it is readying 20,000 troops to deploy to the ISF. But they are unlikely to head into Gaza so long as Hamas opposes the deal, Lowenstein said.",
      "\"Nobody's going to send troops to be a part of the stabilization force that's going to be fighting Hamas,\" he said."

      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump answered a question about potentially striking Mexico or sending American troops or other personnel into the country by saying it would be \u201cOK with me.\"",
      "\u201cWould I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs. Mexico is \u2014 look, I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. There\u2019s some big problems over there,\u201d Trump said after he was asked whether he was considering such action.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped the waterways, but we know every route. We know every route, we know the addresses of every drug lord,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe know their address, we know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They\u2019re killing our people. That\u2019s like a war. Would I do it? I\u2019d be proud to.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan was passed by a majority vote at the United Nations on Monday, though world powers were still divided over whether it can convert a fragile ceasefire into the long-term solution that has eluded the Middle East.",
      "Much about the plan remains uncertain, with occasional outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas threatening the tenuous diplomacy at every turn and Palestinians inside Gaza suffering hunger and now flooding at the onset of a bitter winter.",
      "The fraught path was made clear even before the delegates took to their desks, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 under pressure from his far-right coalition partners \u2014 denouncing the resolution's outlining of a future Palestinian state. Hamas also warned against the U.S. proposal.",
      "The Security Council adopted the plan with 13 votes in favor, zero votes against and two abstentions, Russia and China.",
      "\"Today\u2019s resolution represents another significant step towards a stable Gaza that will be able to prosper, and an environment that will allow Israel to live in security,\" Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the vote.",
      "Designed to usher Gaza from rubble-strewn war zone into a new era, the resolution backs establishing a \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d headed by the president himself, to temporarily govern the territory. Alongside that, an International Stabilization Force, known as the ISF, would take over responsibility from the Israel Defense Forces currently occupying parts of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The proposal would be \u201cphase two\u201d of Trump\u2019s 20-point plan first announced in September, \u201cphase one\u201d of which brought a prisoner and hostage exchange, as well as a ceasefire that has largely held despite accusations of violations from both sides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed at least 69,000 people in Gaza, most of them women and children, according to local health officials. Israel launched it after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist, attack in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 more were kidnapped.",
      "Some Security Council members objected that the U.S. resolution made no reference of Palestinian statehood, according to The Associated Press. The draft now says that after the Palestinian Authority has \u201cfaithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,\u201d the AP reported.",
      "The resolution supporting the U.S. plan is backed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other Arab states, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan. Of those, the only ones on the Security Council are the United States and Pakistan, a nonpermanent member, which therefore does not have a veto.",
      "A joint statement from the United States and its backers said the \u201cprocess offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\u201d and \u201cprovides a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region.\u201d",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, lauded Trump for having \u201cassembled the Arab leaders and got them all to sign on the historic agreement.\u201d On Palestinian statehood, he issued a caveat that \u201cthe resolution does not call for the state, but it does say that it lays the groundwork, providing that there are reforms that have been called for for a long time.\u201d",
      "Even so, the open door to Palestinian statehood within the resolution has angered the Israeli far right, whose leading politicians are propping up Netanyahu\u2019s government. Under pressure from them, Netanyahu came out Sunday saying that \u201cour opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed.\u201d",
      "He said at a meeting: \u201cGaza will be demobilized and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I don\u2019t need reinforcements and tweets and lectures from anyone.\u201d",
      "The Hamas-led Palestinian Resistance Factions called the plan an \"attempt to impose another form of occupation on our land and people\" and \"a violation of our national sovereignty and a continuation of our people's suffering.\"",
      "The delegation from Moscow had put forth its own proposal, which includes stronger language supporting Palestinian statehood.",
      "On a call Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi, \"emphasized the importance of achieving a lasting peace based on universally recognized international legal base,\" according to a Russian readout of the conversation."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday he may hold talks with Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, even as the United States intensified its military pressure with the latest strike on an alleged drug boat and the arrival of its most advanced aircraft carrier.",
      "The suggestion of a possible diplomatic path to defuse the mounting tensions with the South American country came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States would designate the Cartel de los Soles, a group Washington alleges is run by Maduro, as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "The designation, set to take effect on Nov. 24, puts the cartel among the likes of Hamas and the Islamic State group. It allows the U.S. government to seize its assets and makes it unlawful to provide \u201cmaterial support\u201d to the group.",
      "Maduro denies having any ties to the drug trade, accusing the United States of \u201cfabricating\u201d a war against him.",

      "Asked whether the terrorist designation means the United States could then target Maduro\u2019s personal assets, Trump said: \u201cIt allows us to do that, but we haven\u2019t said we\u2019re going to do that.\u201d",
      "He was speaking after U.S. Southern Command confirmed on X that it carried out a strike on an alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific on Saturday, killing three people.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the strike, Southern Command said in a post on X. The post alleged that the boat was \u201coperated by a Designated Terrorist Organization\u201d and was \u201ctrafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific,\u201d adding that the strike took place in international waters.",
      "\u201cIntelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\u201d the post said.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the military\u2019s account. The administration has not provided evidence supporting its allegations about the vessel or the people on board.",
      "Video released by Southern Command appears to show the strike causing a large wave to spike up next to the boat, which is then engulfed in flames.",
      "The United States has now conducted at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats during the second Trump administration, prompting concerns from some lawmakers.",
      "NBC News reported last week that the Trump administration carried out its 20th such attack, according to a Pentagon official. That strike took place in the Caribbean Sea. Previous attacks took place in both the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, and they have killed more than 75 people, according to officials.",
      "Sunday\u2019s announcement came the day the USS Gerald R. Ford, a major aircraft carrier, arrived in the Caribbean.",

      "Both officials said Trump has been meeting with his national security team about Venezuela frequently in recent days. Right now, he is satisfied with the strikes on alleged drug vessels, the senior White House official said. But both officials said Trump has expressed a willingness to strike targets on land, as well.",
      "As of Friday evening, Trump had not signed off on strikes on land, but that could change, the officials said. The military options are ready for him, and the United States has assets in the region now, so if he decides to move forward with strikes, they can begin quickly, the officials said.",
      "The strikes have generated controversy in Congress, as Democrats and some Republicans paint the administration's moves as heavy-handed overreach that circumvents lawmakers.",
      "But in October, the Senate rejected a resolution requiring Trump to obtain congressional approval for military strikes in the Caribbean. The Senate this month voted down a similar resolution that would require the president to obtain congressional approval for any military action against Venezuela.",

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Military threats, summoned ambassadors and even references to beheading: China and Japan are locked in a furious diplomatic spat over Taiwan, with Beijing unleashing language that is far from diplomatic.",
      "The Chinese outrage is directed at Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who told lawmakers last week that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a military response from Tokyo, an unusually explicit statement that experts say is a first for a sitting Japanese prime minister.",
      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has also weighed in on Xue\u2019s comments. \u201cTime for Beijing to behave like the \u2018good neighbor\u2019 it talks repeatedly about \u2014 but fails repeatedly to become,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "China\u2019s warnings to Japan \u201cunderscore its hegemonic mindset and demonstrate that it is a troublemaker intent on unilaterally changing the international order,\u201d the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this week.",
      "None of this may matter all that much to Takaichi, who was expected to clash with Beijing on Taiwan and other issues.",
      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",
      "And while Takaichi wants to be seen as firm on national security, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that she wants a confrontation with China,\u201d he said in an interview Friday in Hong Kong.",
      "So for all the tense exchanges her Taiwan remarks have brought between the two Asian powers, McGregor said, \u201cit\u2019s not a cataclysmic event.\u201d",
      "Kingston agreed.",
      "Takaichi \u201cwent out of her way to be provocative,\u201d he said, \u201cand China responded as expected.\u201d"

      "Every day this week, Zhu has been showing up to the empty venue he had booked for the film festival as a form of protest.",
      "\u201cIt was not the film festival that I prepared for,\u201d the filmmaker told NBC News on Friday morning.",
      "In a statement ahead of the film festival\u2019s cancellation, the organizer said he received messages saying that filmmakers, directors and producers from China set to participate in the event, as well as their relatives, were facing harassment.",
      "Many participants who pulled out of the independent film festival did not say why or cited \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d but a few said they or their family members had been told to do so by Chinese authorities, according to Zhu.",
      "\u201cI hope this announcement of the cancellation of IndieChina Film Festival will make certain unknown forces stop harassing all the directors, guests, former staff, volunteers and my friends and family,\u201d Zhu said in a statement on the festival\u2019s website.",
      "By the time Zhu suspended the film festival, it was too late for him to cancel the venue he had booked. Throughout the week, he has gone to the event space \u2014 sometimes by himself or with a handful of other filmmakers \u2014 to watch some films and discuss them.",
      "\u201cI am still a filmmaker. I\u2019m still a filmmaker from China and I\u2019m still an independent film curator,\u201d Zhu said, adding that independent filmmaking in China \u201cis really difficult; it is extremely different from before.\u201d",
      "Before moving to New York City a decade ago, Zhu had worked on independent film festivals in China for nearly 20 years and co-founded the Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "But independent film festivals in China began facing increasing crackdowns after Chinese President Xi Jinping, known for his stringent ideological control, stepped into power in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. The nongovernmental organization investigating human rights abuses around the world has said that Chinese authorities have shut down all three major independent film festivals in China, including Zhu\u2019s Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "\u201cEventually, all of my film festivals were banned, none of them could continue,\u201d Zhu said.",
      "Following what happened to his film festival in Beijing, Zhu had been rethinking how to host a film festival focused on Chinese independent films that could avoid censorship \u2014 the New York City event was the first attempt at that.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City,\u201d Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.\u201d",

      "Ariana Grande was shielded by her \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d co-star Cynthia Erivo from an overzealous fan who rushed them at the Singapore premiere of their new movie.",
      "The man who rushed Grande, Johnson Wen, later appeared in court where local media reported he was charged with being a public nuisance.",
      "Wen posted the video to his own Instagram account where he thanked Grande for \"letting\" him jump on to the carpet. Wen has an Instagram account under the name \"Pyjama Man\" where he posts about rushing concert stages and sporting events.",
      "But it did not appear that Grande was aware of the situation in the video, looking scared as the man ran toward her and put his arm around her while she stood beside her \"Wicked\" co-star Michelle Yeoh.",
      "Erivo, the film's co-headliner, immediately jumped into action across the two women and tried to pry Wen off of Grande as security moved toward them. Yeoh also appeared to put her arms around Grande to pull her away from the man.",
      "Videos posted by others online showed that Erivo seemed to move positions on the carpet to ensure Grande walked in between her and Yeoh.",
      "Representatives for the \"Wicked\" film franchise did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"Wicked\" For Good\" is being released by Universal Pictures, which is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.",
      "Fans of Grande offered a fierce defense of the singer in the comments of Wen's Instagram video, with some describing it as an assault on Grande. Commenters also called on others to report the man's account.",
      "Some of Grande's fans pointed out that the singer has experienced prior trauma at events, referencing the 2017 bombing of her concert in Manchester where 22 people were killed. Grande, who says she's always dealt with anxiety, told British Vogue in 2018 that she dealt with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack.",
      "\"After all the trauma Ari has been through, this is beyond disrespectful,\" one commenter wrote. \"Not just to her, but to the cast and to all the fans. It\u2019s literally infuriating. You should be ashamed.\"",
      "Wen has posted videos of himself crashing concert stages, including at Katy Perry and The Weeknd shows, as well as rushing the fields at sporting events. In a message to NBC News, Wen described himself as a \"mega fan\" of Grande and that he was \"happy\" to meet her.",
      "\"I dreamed about meeting her and now my dreams became true,\" he wrote.",
      "He did not respond to a request for comment on the backlash he's facing online or that he might have scared Grande through his actions."
