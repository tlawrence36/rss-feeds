      "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has unveiled shortlists in 10 categories, including for documentary, international feature and best song and score",
      "The Selena Gomez ballad \u201cMi Camino,\u201d the Will Ferrell and Harper Steele road trip documentary \u201cWill & Harper\u201d and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross\u2019s pulsating \u201cChallengers\u201d score are one step closer to an Oscar nomination. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled shortlists in 10 categories Tuesday, including for documentary, international feature, best song and score.",
      "Two musicals, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cWicked,\u201d were well represented in the categories. Netflix\u2019s audacious transgender drug-lord drama \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d was most named, advancing in international feature, original score, two original songs including \u201cMi Camino\u201d and \u201cEl Mal\u201d (performed by Zoe Salda\u00f1a), sound and hair and makeup.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d also moved forward in several categories, like hair and makeup, original score, sound and visual effects. The adaptation of the Broadway musical did not include original songs and therefore wasn\u2019t eligible in that category. The song semifinalists include several notable artists, like Pharrell Williams for \u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d Lainey Wilson for her \u201cTwisters\u201d song \u201cOut Of Oklahoma,\u201d Elton John and Brandi Carlile for \u201cNever Too Late\u201d and Robbie Williams for \u201cForbidden Road\u201d from \u201cBetter Man.\u201d Diane Warren may also be heading for a 16th nomination for her song from \u201cThe Six Triple Eight.\u201d Nicholas Britell\u2019s \u201cWinter Coat,\u201d performed by Saoirse Ronan in \u201cBlitz,\u201d was also included.",
      "Among the 15 documentaries eligible for nominations are \u201cThe Bibi Files,\u201d \u201cDaughters,\u201d \u201cEno,\u201d \u201cFrida,\u201d \u201cThe Remarkable Life of Ibelin,\u201d \u201cDahomey,\u201d \u201cUnion,\u201d \u201cPorcelain War\u201d and \u201cNo Other Land.\u201d",
      "International features advancing include \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d (Brazil), \u201cUniversal Language\u201d (Canada), \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d (Germany), \u201cKneecap\u201d (Ireland), \u201cVermiglio\u201d (Italy), \u201cFlow\u201d (Latvia) and \u201cDahomey\u201d (Senegal).",
      "As most of the shortlists are in below-the-line categories celebrating crafts, there are also films that aren\u2019t necessarily the most obvious of Oscar contenders. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d was singled out for both sound and visual effects, as was \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d which also got a nod for score.",
      "For the most part, shortlists are determined by members in their respective categories, though the specifics vary from branch to branch: Some have committees, some have minimum viewing requirements.",
      "These lists will narrow to five when final nominations are announced on Jan. 17. The 97th Oscars, hosted by Conan O\u2019Brien, will be held on Sunday, March 2, broadcasting on ABC and streaming live on Hulu."

    "story": [
      "Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams has been named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris",
      "PARIS -- Pop star and fashion designer Pharrell Williams was named UNESCO\u2019s goodwill ambassador for artistic education and entrepreneurship on Tuesday in Paris, continuing his cultural dominance of the French capital as Louis Vuitton menswear artistic director and performer at Notre Dame Cathedral\u2019s reopening earlier this month.",
      "Williams said he hoped to \u201cdeepen that sense of unity and togetherness\u201d in work that \u201cevens the odds for marginalized communities.\u201d",
      "He also spoke about his impoverished youth, adding: \u201cGrowing up in Virginia, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be given an opportunity like this one.\"",
      "The role of goodwill ambassador for the Paris-based U.N. cultural agency involves promoting its initiatives that include protecting Indigenous cultures, advancing education and health care for women, raising awareness about genocide prevention and safeguarding cultural heritage.",
      "The U.N. agency said Williams will be \u201ca mentor and role model for young creators, particularly in Africa, where UNESCO supports the development of cultural industries.\u201d",
      "Williams joins a list of goodwill ambassadors that includes U.S. jazz musician Herbie Hancock, Brazilian artist Vik Muniz and Japanese filmmaker Naomi Kawase.",
      "Williams has been particularly visible in Paris this year. Shortly before the Paris Olympics, his role as Louis Vuitton menswear designer took center stage during a star-studded event at UNESCO\u2019s headquarters. The show, celebrating the beauty of human skin, featured models wearing garments in shades representing the diverse hues of humanity.",
      "UNESCO leaders hope that Williams' global influence and deep connections to fashion and music will draw fresh attention to the agency\u2019s work.",
      "Williams is American, and his selection as goodwill ambassador also may be highlighting the readmission of the United States to UNESCO last year.",
      "The U.S. exit under President Donald Trump cited alleged anti-Israel bias within the agency. The decision followed a 2011 decision by UNESCO to include Palestine as a member state, which led the U.S. and Israel to cease financing for the agency.",
      "The U.S. return under President Joe Biden was marked by a flag-raising ceremony attended by U.S. First Lady Jill Biden."

      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in theaters Thursday, takes audiences back to Mufasa's days as a cub and explains how he and Scar came to be brothers",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d has one very important thing going for it: an original story.",
      "That may seem like faint praise or at least a very, very low bar in the grand scheme of things. But in a landscape where Disney continues to remake its animated catalogue in slightly different, and usually less interesting, forms whether \u201clive action\u201d or \u201cphotorealistic\u201d that usually only serves to remind how good the 2D animation was, originality is not to be undervalued.",
      "And this story isn\u2019t simply checking off fan service boxes and overexplaining origins that never needed them: It\u2019s actually good. A prequel to \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d opening in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s a tale of found family, betrayal and destiny, one that begins to explain the estrangement between brothers Scar and Mufasa that we all know will end in murder, how Mufasa ( Aaron Pierre ) ends up as king of the pride lands and, perhaps most importantly, why only one has an English accent.",
      "In this telling, Scar was once Taka (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), destined to be king of his pride, and Mufasa was a lost cub, separated from his parents in a dramatic flood. Taka saves Mufasa and brings him into his family. His mother (Thandiwe Newton) embraces the newcomer; his father (Lennie James) rejects him as nothing but a stray. Not that it matters much to the cubs; both are thrilled to have a brother. They play and protect one another and grow up together. But fissures start to appear in this foundation as Mufasa emerges as the exceptional one and Taka as the coward. And then a lioness enters the picture in Sarabi (Tiffany Boone). We\u2019ve all seen enough movies to know what happens with that.",
      "The screenplay comes from veteran screenwriter Jeff Nathanson, whose credits include the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d this year\u2019s lovely \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d and \u201cCatch Me If You Can.\u201d He clearly took a corporate mandate (give us more \u201cLion King\u201d) and made the absolute least cynical version of that. There are still questionable corporate-feeling choices, like straining to tie it to a current and future \u201cLion King\u201d by having Rafiki (John Kani) tell the story to Simba (Donald Glover) and Nala\u2019s ( Beyonc\u00e9 ) daughter Kiara ( Blue Ivy Carter ), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) and Timon (Billy Eichner). These comedic breaks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s songs peppered throughout, aren\u2019t additive. They really only serve to break up the momentum of the compelling main story.",
      "But the biggest issue remains the form itself. The photo-realistic computer-generated animals may have technically improved since the 2019 \u201cLion King,\u201d but they still aren\u2019t movie stars like their 2D animation counterparts. Impressive though it may be intellectually, the reality of watching these animals for two hours is a somewhat numbing and dull experience despite the best efforts of director Barry Jenkins. The Oscar-winning filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d did an admirable job adding visual interest and color into the landscapes, bringing it closer to the vibrancy of animation than ever before, and making it as cinematic as possible. The original story also helps here in that he was never going to have to recreate iconic sequences in a less stimulating form. There are just inherent limitations that filmmakers have not yet figured out, including how odd it looks for these animals\u2019 mouths to be moving and speaking English words. It\u2019s strangest when they\u2019re singing, mouths agape to hold the long notes in a way that no lion\u2019s mouth should ever appear.",
      "If this is one future for filmmaking there\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement and experimentation. That doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be embraced while the kinks are worked out. But it also doesn\u2019t mean the moviegoing public has to get excited about every rehash. \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d is better than the ones that came before it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s great.",
      "\u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d a Walt Disney Studios release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cperil, action/violence and some thematic elements.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it will soon require hotels, vacation rental platforms and live event promoters to disclose any fees up front when they list prices.",
      "The FTC said consumers often see advertised prices for hotel rooms, short-term rentals, and tickets to sporting events and concerts only to be surprised later by so-called \u201cjunk fees,\u201d including resort fees, cleaning fees, processing fees and other extra charges.",
      "\u201cPeople deserve to know up front what they\u2019re being asked to pay without worrying that they\u2019ll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven\u2019t budgeted for and can\u2019t avoid,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement.",
      "The rule is scheduled to go into effect in 120 days.",
      "Ticketmaster said Tuesday it supports the new rule.",
      "\u201cTicketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing as a nationwide industry standard, and we\u2019re pleased to see the FTC mandate the necessary changes to make ticket-buying more transparent for fans,\u201d the company said.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Tuesday with the American Hotel and Lodging Association.",
      "Four of the FTC\u2019s five commissioners voted to approve the rule. Commissioner Andrew Ferguson, \u2013 who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice to replace Khan, was the one dissenting vote.",
      "The rule requires lodging and ticketing businesses to clearly and conspicuously disclose the true cost \u2013 including all mandatory fees \u2013 when they display any pricing. Businesses that exclude taxes or shipping fees from advertised prices must also disclose them before customers enter any payment information.",
      "The FTC estimates the rule will save U.S. consumers 53 million hours per year of time spent searching for the true price of lodging or events.",
      "The FTC launched the rule-making process in 2022, asking for public input on whether a fee-disclosure rule might help eliminate unfair and deceptive pricing. The agency said more than 12,000 people commented.",
      "Junk fees and deceptive pricing are also one of the reasons the Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, earlier this year. The government asked a court to separate the companies, saying they have a monopoly on concert promotion and ticketing that drives up price for consumers.",
      "The Biden administration also has targeted the fee practices of U.S. airlines, banks and online payment platforms."

      "Panto is as much a part of Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies",
      "LONDON -- Here\u2019s a recipe as essential to Christmas in Britain as turkey, tinsel and mince pies.",
      "Mix a fairy-tale plot with topical references, slapstick, song, dance and double entendres. Drench in sequins and spangles, mix vigorously, add some noisy audience participation, and you have a panto.",
      "Pantos \u2014 short for pantomimes \u2014 are stage musicals that play at theaters big and small across the U.K. each winter. Formulaic but anarchic, family friendly but a little risque, they are a holiday tradition that give many children their first exposure to live theater \u2014 and adults a chance to cut loose.",
      "Anyone who thinks Britons are buttoned up hasn't been to a panto. Audiences happily shed their inhibitions \u2013 cheering, singing, hissing the villain, shouting \u201cHe\u2019s behind you!\u201d to warn the hero.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s singing, dancing, laughing \u2014 taking the family out and being able to be out with their kids and letting the kids run riot,\u201d said Clive Rowe, who directed and stars in \u201cDick Whittington and his Cat\u201d at the Hackney Empire \u2014 his 17th annual panto for the storied east London theater.",
      "Pantomime has deep roots, stretching back to the stock characters and bawdy humor of the 16th-century Italian commedia dell\u2019arte and the French harlequinade, as well as the English music hall. By the late 19th century, the elements had gelled into a form still recognizable today.",
      "The plots are drawn from well-known fairy tales and children\u2019s stories such as \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cCinderella.\u201d Characters include a plucky hero, or \u201cprincipal boy,\u201d often played by a woman, an outrageous villain, and a \u201cdame,\u201d a sharp-tongued matron who is always played by a man in fabulously flamboyant drag.",
      "\u201cThe pantomime dame is the beating heart of the show,\u201d said Simon Sladen, curator of theater and performance at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cShe is that engine that drives it. Firstly with pace and anarchy, but also a little bit of sauce on the side.\u201d",
      "An estimated 3 million people in Britain attend a pantomime each year, in venues ranging from small regional theaters to London West End playhouses. Many theaters rely on them for a big chunk of their annual income.",
      "When London\u2019s theaters were closed for months by pandemic lockdowns in 2020, panto dames led a protest march through the city to stress their importance to the creative economy.",
      "They provide seasonal work to faded pop stars, television entertainers, the occasional Hollywood celebrity \u2014 Pamela Anderson took Liverpool by storm when she starred in \u201cAladdin\u201d in 2010, singing \u201cSanta Baby\u201d while suspended on a swing above the stage, dressed in costumes by Vivienne Westwood.",
      "They are also vital experience for many young actors, including the A-listers of tomorrow.",
      "Jude Law told The Associated Press recently that he\u2019d played Humpty Dumpty, recalling his performance as \u201cloud and round.\u201d At 17, Michael Fassbender played one of Cinderella\u2019s Ugly Sisters, and a tree.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Jonathan Bailey starred alongside a young Nicholas Hoult in a production of \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Hoult also appeared in \u201cMother Goose\u201d as a child, and says he would happily do another, as they\u2019re \u201creally fun.\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up the art form, Bailey called it a \u201cquintessentially British bloody good time for all the family.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s pantos often strive to reflect diversity, both onstage and in the audience. Rowe, whose Hackney Empire pantos draw many of their cast and crew from Britain\u2019s Black communities, said that at its core the genre is \u201cabout acceptance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, it\u2019s about the idea that being different isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be brought in and kind of celebrated and that no matter where you are in society, from the youngest to the oldest, we all have a place and we should embrace that.\u201d",
      "Drag performer Ginger Johnson, starring in an adult \u201call-drag panto\u201d version of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d at London\u2019s Phoenix Theatre, said that panto\u2019s ability to change is \u201cwhy it\u2019s managed to survive for so long as a cultural form.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of kids, panto is the first time that they come in contact with drag as well,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Stage historian Sladen said that some are leaning into the drag element of panto, with \u201ca bigger, wider explosion of roles than just the dame and the principal boy being cross-dressed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe might see the fairy godmother played by a dame or played by a drag artist. We might see a wicked stepmother, also played by a very well-known drag performer. So (it\u2019s) constantly evolving, constantly changing with the times.\u201d",

She instead belongs to a revolving sisterhood of performers who, at a glance, have little in common \u2014 but all have donned a bowler hat and slinked across the stage.",
      "There are the musical theater professionals far from household names. Others, much like Roxie herself, have notoriety but little stage experience. Some are ingenues on the cusp of fame. Some are world-weary, looking to reclaim the spotlight.",
      "Since 1996, the list of Roxies has included Brooke Shields, Sandy Duncan, Marilu Henner, Christie Brinkley, Mel B, Gretchen Mol, Brandy, Robin Givens, Lisa Rinna, Ashlee Simpson, Jennifer Nettles, \u201cTrading Spaces\u201d host Paige Davis, \u201cPose\u201d star Angelica Ross and Ariana Madix of \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d",

      "Roxie isn't a cute role: She kills her lover and tries to get her dimwitted husband to take the blame. She grows insatiably hungry for fame behind bars and, after an acquittal, teams up with rival Velma to cash in with a revue. \u201cThe name on everybody\u2019s lips / Is gonna be Roxie,\u201d she purrs.",

You can get your Broadway debut and legacy in under eight weeks.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the timing. It\u2019s all about persistence and never accepting a no,\u201d Stewart says. (If a target Roxie ages out of the role, he says, the offer shifts to Matron \u201cMama\u201d Morton.)",
      "Celebrities sign up for different reasons: Broadway is on their bucket list. Their latest tour sold poorly. They were recently divorced. They're doing it for their kids.",
      "\u201cThey need some way of saying to the world, \u2018I\u2019m worthy. I can prove my mettle,\u2019\u201d says Stewart.",
      "Once or twice a year he goes to a newsstand and buys $400 worth of magazines \u2014 Ebony, People, Variety, you name it. He hands them to his staff, along with black pens.",

      "Butler usually asks the Roxie-to-be to draw on what they know: red carpets, news conferences, getting their pictures taken by paparazzi. They go from there.",
      "\u201cUltimately, your feet are probably going to have to leave the ground and you\u2019re probably going to have to kick. So I\u2019m going to have to teach you how to punch your foot,\u201d he tells his starry students.",
      "He started one session with Rita Wilson by asking her if she had a favorite pose. \u201cAnd she was like, \u2018Oh my God! I have this pose,\u2019\u201d Butler says. \u201cWe used it and then she starts to build from that.\u201d",
      "The original \u201cChicago\u201d debuted on Broadway in 1975, directed by Bob Fosse. Butler credits Ann Reinking \u2014 the iconic Fosse collaborator who originated Roxie in the 1996 revival and created the choreography in Fosse's style \u2014 with cracking how to accommodate the skillset of each successive Roxie. Vocal coaches also help find the right keys and approach to each song.",
      "One of the harder things Roxie faces comes during the song \u201cHot Honey Rag.\u201d In a sequence nicknamed The Cakewalk, the actor must dance backward while executing a series of intricate hand movements. Trained dancers, like Reinking, rely on their strong cores. But Melanie Griffith, primarily a film actor, struggled with The Cakewalk. The two experimented with different ideas as Griffith prepared to become Roxie in 2003.",
      "\u201cShe just started doing a move and Annie saw her do this thing and she went, \u2018Oh my, God! OK. Do that again,\u2019\u201d he recalls.",
      "What Griffith had done was fan her hands over her head and make her hips and hands move at the same time.",
      "\u201cAnnie, said \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s your move,\u2019\u201d he recounts. \u201cSo now there\u2019s a step in the show that we call The Melanie, just in case I have an actress where The Cakewalk does not look awesome on them.\u201d",
      "Some elements may be tweaked but make no mistake: It's hard work.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s new parts of my body that are sore that I didn\u2019t know would actually get sore,\u201d says Alyssa Milano, one of the newest Roxies, in the middle of her boot camp. \u201cAnd I've been a dancer all my life.\u201d",
      "The Roxies who don't have extensive stage or dance backgrounds may feel vulnerable.",
      "\u201cI tell them that falls right in line with Roxie Hart,\u201d Butler says. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Honey, you are halfway there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Melora Hardin was more than halfway there. \u201cThe Office\u201d star arrived not only able to sing, but also as a lifelong dancer, first in ballet and then in jazz.",
      "Hardin was taught a few numbers in a Valley studio before flying to New York to perform in front of Weissler and his team.",
      "She could tell they liked it.",
      "\u201cBarry walks me to the window and kind of puts his arm around my shoulder and asks, \u2018Where have you been? Why haven't I met you before?\u2019\u201d she remembers.",
      "She got the job on the spot.",
      "Fast-forward and Hardin in late 2008 made her Broadway debut, with her husband and two young daughters in the audience. When fans threw her roses, she'd try to toss them to her girls. She laughs that the crowd seemed more impressed by her somersault than nailing her Fosse steps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that I will hold as one of the most joyful times of my life,\u201d says Hardin. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a more wonderful experience.\u201d",
      "Roxie has been kicking for more than 11,000 performances on Broadway, despite recession, storms, a pandemic and an Oscar-winning adaptation. \u201cChicago\u201d is the second longest-running show in Broadway history, behind only the now-closed \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d In all, the musical has been seen by more than 32 million people across 36 countries and more than 500 cities.",
      "\u201cThe show changes from actor to actor, from country to country, from city to city, from company to company,\u201d says Butler.",
      "But Butler has his favorites. He still gets excited whenever one of his Roxies slays: \u201cIt\u2019s like giving birth. I\u2019m just like, \u2018Oh, my God, my little baby\u2019s about to step up!\u2019\u201d",
      "Trends come and go, but \u201cChicago\u201d endures, fed by a plot replete with celebrity culture, greed and media manipulation. \u201cIt keeps becoming more relevant, not less. More,\u201d says Weissler.",
      "Bobbie bristles at critics who deride the revolving door as a gimmick: \u201cYou can call it stunt casting all you want. There\u2019s an authenticity to it.\u201d",
      "He argues that \u201cChicago\u201d will always be different than most other Broadway shows.",

      "Crime writer John D",
      "NEW YORK -- Crime writer John D. MacDonald, a master of the genre, was so prolific that sometimes even he couldn't keep up with what he was doing.",
      "He might have dozens of stories in submission at once and would leave some unfinished or unpublished as he moved on to a new idea. One of the surviving manuscripts was recently discovered and appears this week in the literary quarterly The Strand Magazine, which has run rarities by Ernest Hemingway,Tennessee Williams and many others. \"The Accomplice\u201d is an early work from the author known for his Travis McGee series and for the novel \u201cThe Executioners,\u201d retitled \u201cCape Fear\u201d in two film adaptations.",
      "The newly seen story, a narrative of lust, betrayal and dangerous choices, was found in the archives at the University of Florida.",
      "\u201cRaw and gritty, the narrative embraces classic noir tropes, only to flip them in quintessential MacDonald style with an unexpected and thought-provoking finale,\u201d Strand managing editor Andrew F. Gulli writes in the current issue.",
      "\u201cThe Accomplice\u201d is set in a grocery store where a \u201cnearly\u201d 18-year clerk named Joey works alongside the middle-aged owner, John Mallon, and his younger wife, Belle, whom MacDonald introduces as tall and long-faced, very white and so thin and taut that \u201cher hips stuck out against the dresses she wore.\u201d Before long, she is paying close attention to Joey, who would prefer \u2014 at first \u2014 that she keep it all professional.",
      "\u201cIt scared him a little when he realized that when they were alone, in the store he\u2019d head for the space behind the meat counter or the entrance to the cellar where the stock was kept, knowing that she would find some excuse to go by him,\u201d MacDonald writes.",
      "\u201cAfter he realized that, he had a hard time getting to sleep at night and sometimes he would dream about her. In the dreams she was cold to touch, and like snakes. And then she would get mixed up in the dream with other girls.\u201d",
      "In a plot turn known to fans of \u201cDouble Indemnity\u201d and other noir favorites, Belle proposes that they kill her husband and use the insurance money to go into business together.",
      "\"She whispered, \u2018How are we going to do it, Joey?\u2019\u201d",
      "MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, in 1916, and later moved with his family to Utica, New York, where he was still living when he wrote \u201cThe Accomplice.\u201d He settled in Sarasota, Florida in the early 1950s and remained for decades before dying in Milwaukee, in 1986. His books have sold millions of copies and numerous authors, including Stephen King, have cited him as an influence. He is especially loved in Florida, and was honored in song by another famous state resident, Jimmy Buffett, who offered tribute in \u201cIncommunicado.\u201d",
      "According to MacDonald scholar Calvin Branche, the author likely wrote \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d in the late 1940s-early 1950s and set it aside amidst other projects. His wife, Dorothy, had gotten one of his stories published while he was serving overseas in World War II, and he was anxious to follow up, writing some 80 hours a week. MacDonald was still a few years away from his Travis McGee books, but Branche said that \u201cThe Accomplice\u201d did anticipate the moral struggles of McGee and other MacDonald protagonists.",
      "\u201c(Joey) stands up to her temptation despite having initially thought her plan and a future with her might be good,\u201d Branche says. \u201cThe reader is pleased with this conclusion, and it is the kind of insight characters find in many of the stories.\u201d"

      "Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times",
      "NEW YORK -- Over the four years he\u2019s spent working on \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Barry Jenkins estimates that he\u2019s been asked why he wanted to make it at least 400 times.",
      "The question of why Jenkins, the filmmaker of \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d would want to jump into the big-budget, photorealistic animated Disney world of lions and tigers has bedeviled much of a film world that reveres him.",
      "Countless other directors had made leaps into CGI-heavy blockbuster-making before. But Jenkins\u2019 decision was uniquely analyzed \u2013 perhaps because there\u2019s no more heralded, or trusted, filmmaker today under the age of 50 than Jenkins.",
      "\u201cIt just thought it was something I could not deny,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cI had to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, brings together movie worlds that ordinarily stay very far apart. On the one hand, you have the Oscar-winning, 45-year-old director of some of the most luminous and lyrical films of the past decade. On the other, you have the intellectual property imperatives of today\u2019s Hollywood. What happens when they collide?",
      "The result in \u201cMufasa,\u201d about the lion cub's orphaned upbringing set both before and after the events of Jon Favreau's 2019 remake of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d is an uncommonly textured and thoughtfully rendered spectacle that, Jenkins maintained in a recent interview, has more in common with \u201cMoonlight\u201d than you\u2019d think. Made with virtual filmmaking tools, \u201cMufasa\u201d essentially plopped one of the most groundbreaking filmmakers working today into an all-digital playground, with a budget more than a hundred times that of \u201cMoonlight.\u201d",
      "Often in \u201cMufasa,\u201d you can feel Jenkins\u2019 sensibility warming and enhancing what can, in other less sensitively commanded films, feel soulless. With songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201cMufasa\u201d works as a big-movie entertainment and, even more surprisingly, as a Barry Jenkins film.",
      "\u201cMy head was spinning when this started,\u201d Jenkins says. \u201cIt actually reminded me of when I first got into filmmaking. This felt oddly enough very similar to that first experience. You can sort of run away from that newness and be intimidated by it, or you can embrace it, learn the things you don\u2019t know and then start to bend it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also an experience that has quite evidently changed Jenkins, exponentially expanding his filmmaking tool kit while opening his eyes to new ways of making movies. \u201cIt was almost like learning a new language,\u201d Jenkins says of the process. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.",
      "Jenkins: At least 400 times. But it came down to the spirit and the warmth of Jeff Nathanson\u2019s script and also the spirit and the warmth I always found in the story. I came to \u201cThe Lion King\u201d by babysitting my nephews way, way back in the 1990s. My sister was a single mom and I\u2019d be at home watching with the kids. You\u2019d put on different VHSs and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d was always the one that stuck. I just thought: Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to, coming out of something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d to step into this thing that\u2019s so full of light?",
      "JENKINS: Maybe warmer, lighter but still just as deep, just as spiritual. This idea of family legacy, of finding your place in the world, those are things that are very present in \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d If I was telling you, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this film about this kid who has this almost biblical experience involving water and a parent figure that he then gets displaced from, and has to find his place in the world, I could be talking about \u201cMoonlight\u201d or I could be talking about \u201cMufasa.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: It wasn\u2019t about the notions of who people thought I was. But I was looking to expand just the kind of filmmaking I was doing at that point. This came right in the thick of pretty much a seven-year cycle, from beginning \u201cMoonlight\u201d to being in post on \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d the way this movie is made, with this virtual production, it\u2019s just a very new way of making films. There\u2019s maybe been five or six movies made with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: I did. We evolved this process to the point where we could create so much of all the world and the movement in virtual space, and we could then take our virtual cameras into virtual production. We evolved the animation to the point where we could create the light, we could create the set, we could create the environment. (Cinematographer) James (Laxton) would be there and I would be there, and we\u2019re blasting the voices of the actors into the room and the animators are moving through and I\u2019m directing the blocking, and the camera is responding to the blocking in real time.",
      "JENKINS: Absolutely. Look, I\u2019m a filmmaker who was on set with \u201cMoonlight,\u201d I\u2019ve got 25 days and the sun is going down. Yeah, you\u2019re trying to find a place for the camera, you have ideas, but those ideas aren\u2019t practically achievable. In this sense, the camera could be anywhere. It could be everywhere. It\u2019s sort of the same questions but the possibility of answering is so immediate and direct.",
      "JENKINS: I want to unpack what you just said. We\u2019ve been talking, and I\u2019ve been talking about using these tools to create a very physical, in-person experience. I don\u2019t consider this a project that\u2019s all digital and all computer animated. If I made this movie again right now, it wouldn\u2019t take me four years. It\u2019d probably take me two and a quarter. If I was going to do another one of these films, I would have such a stronger foundation. It wouldn\u2019t feel like something that\u2019s alien or something that\u2019s other or that\u2019s all digital. It would just feel like filmmaking.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. I love through this process I\u2019ve learned so many other ways of making a film that I just could not learn making something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d What I love now is the overlap between the two of them. When I began this process, I talked to Matt Reeves because I had heard he had used some of these tools to pre-vis \u201cThe Batman.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know that shot where the Penguin is in his car and Batman is walking upside down? I discovered that in the volume.\u201d I said, \u201cOf course you did.\u201d I was like, Oh my God, we could have pre-vised \u201cMoonlight\u201d with this technology.",
      "JENKINS: One thousand percent. The light can be anywhere in this film and the camera can be anywhere. That doesn\u2019t mean it should be everywhere. The next time I go out to make a film whether it\u2019s something like \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d or \u201cBeale Street,\u201d James and I are probably going to incorporate these tools as well. Because figuring out the light is half the battle, as they say in \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d",
      "JENKINS: This is all new. It\u2019s all being developed right now. We went down to \u201cAvatar\u201d and spoke to the engineers there. They heard what we were trying to do and sent some people to embed with us and they helped us evolve our process, so we could have these animators with two legs move as if they have four legs. What I\u2019m saying is: This is the wild, wild West."

      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "The only investor who spoke at the sentencing was Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

      "The \u201cI'm Sorry\u201d and \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d hitmaker who shared stages with both Elvis Presley and the Beatles is a guide to those heady years in \u201cAmerican Masters \u2014 Brenda Lee: Rockin\u2019 Around,\u201d which premieres Monday on PBS.",
      "\u201cThat era can never be repeated again,\u201d she tells The Associated Press on the eve of the broadcast. \u201cThat was an era when the money wasn\u2019t thought about, the fame wasn\u2019t thought about. I know that sounds crazy, but it is true. The artists of that time were there to do their thing, and they loved it, whether they got paid or not.\u201d",
      "Lee, 80, had her first hit record in 1960 at age 15 and went on to sell more than 100 million albums. In the \u201960s, she earned more Hot 100 singles in the United States \u2014 46 \u2014 than any recording artist besides the Beatles, Presley or Ray Charles. She won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.",
      "She is the rare artist inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, moving effortlessly in her career between country, pop, rock and rockabilly sounds.",
      "\u201cI never classified myself as a ballad singer, as a rock singer, as a country singer or anything. I just wanted to sing,\u201d she says in the interview. \u201cSome artists can sing it all. Not me. I have to love what I\u2019m singing or it\u2019s not believable.\u201d",
      "The documentary draws on the commentary of musicologists and such stars as Keith Urban, Tanya Tucker, Trisha Yearwood, Jackie DeShannon, Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo.",
      "\u201cI had no trouble getting people to talk about Brenda and why she matters and why we should look to her,\u201d says director Barbara Hall. \u201cThis is what\u2019s possible when you just get your head down and stay focused and do what you know you\u2019re good at and don\u2019t give up.\u201d",
      "Lee was the daughter of a carpenter in Atlanta who died in a construction accident when she was just 8. Her mother soon was forced to work in the cotton mill. When she was 10, country music singer Red Foley put her on his national TV program \u201cOzark Jubilee.\u201d By age 12, she had appeared on various network TV variety shows.",
      "The portrait that emerges is a rare one for the music industry, the story of a young woman who is protected and nurtured. Lee credits producer Owen Bradley; her manager, Dub Allbritten; and the musicians she worked with for looking out for her, treating her like a little sister.",
      "\u201cI hear horror stories about children in show business, but I certainly didn\u2019t have that experience, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt was like I was one of the group, and that was so important to me.\u201d",
      "The holidays are when Lee shines most, with her hit \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d in high rotation. In 2023, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time ever, 65 years after the song\u2019s debut.",
      "\u201cShe is in your house every Christmas,\u201d says Hall. \u201cShe is a part of something that so many Americans celebrate. So, I\u2019m hoping that people will embrace her story and her music once they get reintroduced to it.\u201d",
      "She recorded it at age 13 in July 1958, not exactly a snowy time in the South. The air conditioner was cranked up in the recording studio and there was a Christmas tree set up to get everyone in the mood. It initially was a bigger hit abroad and later got a boost in the 1990 film \u201cHome Alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou get a wonderful song and it may lay around for a few years like \u2018Rockin\u2019\u2019 did, but if it\u2019s as wonderful as \u2019Rockin\u2033 was, it\u2019ll show its head sooner or later, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Lee says.",
      "Hall, who worked on a 2017 \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d documentary on Patsy Cline, says she tried to find any dirt on Lee and simply couldn't. Even when Lee broke her leg during the shoot and had to be hospitalized, she was gracious and kind.",
      "\u201cIf my leg was broken in 10 places and I had to be in a rehab facility, I\u2019d probably be in a bad mood the whole time,\" she says. \"She was cracking jokes and everyone in the room felt like she was their friend.\u201d"

      "Teen drug use hasn\u2019t rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "NEW YORK -- Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.",
      "About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn\u2019t used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That\u2019s the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.",
      "Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn\u2019t used any of those substances recently, another record. Among 8th graders, 90% didn\u2019t use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.",
      "The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they\u2019d used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.",
      "Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan\u2019s Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if we\u2019re seeing the start of something, or not.\"",
      "The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year\u2019s findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades 8, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is \u201cone of the best, if not the best\" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.",
      "Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.",
      "As lockdowns ended, \u201cI think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.",
      "But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.",
      "Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.",
      "Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,\u201d Miech said.",
      "Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.",
      "\u201cSome teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,\" Clark said. \"It's a complicated relationship.\u201d",

      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

      "An Alabama woman received a pig kidney transplant last month and is free from dialysis for the first time in eight years",
      "NEW YORK -- An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs.",
      "Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ \u2014 and notably, she isn\u2019t as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",
      "Locke, who recently joined the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, visited last week to check her longtime patient's progress. Looney hugged her, saying, \u201cThank you for not giving up on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever,\u201d Locke responded.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guidance on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern year after year introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",

      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",
      "Richard Besser, CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kennedy \u201ca truly dangerous\u201d choice.",
      "Besser, in an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, said Kennedy stands out as a \u201csingle potential Cabinet member who could do the most damage to the American people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "Cooper will leave office at the end of the year because of term limits.",
      "Despite opposition in the GOP-controlled General Assembly for several years, Medicaid expansion in North Carolina passed with bipartisan support last year after Congress offered states more financial incentives to join the program. The federal government foots 90% of the expansion costs under the program.",
      "In just the first few weeks of the program's rollout, the state had 300,000 North Carolinians \u2014 half of its goal \u2014 enroll in Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is part of a handful of Southern states that now participate in the program.",
      "More than a third of expansion enrollees come from rural communities, according to Cooper's office. About 4.1 million prescriptions related to heart health, diabetes and other diseases have been filled so far because of the new coverage, the governor's office said."

      "A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby says he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution\u2019s leading expert changed his opinion on how three infants died",
      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",

      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",

      "A strained relationship with family, for example, can make this time of year pretty lonely. The holidays are expensive, and financial woes can cause major stress. Anxiety about holiday anything can fuel depression and worsen existing mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cA lot of people at certain years can find the holidays to be more challenging than they have experienced in past years,\u201d said Shilagh Mirgain, a psychologist at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the common humanity that others, too, are struggling.",
      "\"You\u2019re not alone.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what experts say you can do to make your holiday season a little more bearable, if not cheery.",
      "Spending an extended amount of time with family is hard to avoid around the holidays, Mirgain said, but there are ways to make it a little easier.",
      "\u201cCertainly this year, I think with the recent election, there\u2019s a lot of divisiveness and discord, and you\u2019re probably having to interact with family members that have really opposing beliefs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can bring up strong emotions.\u201d",
      "Think about the boundaries you want to set: What kind of contact do you want to have with your family and how long are you prepared to be around them?",
      "It\u2019s also important to give yourself permission to exit the event \u2014 and have some strategies in place, she said. For example, if you need some space, go on a walk or run some errands.",
      "And if stressful conversations come up, have some language ready to go to draw your boundaries quickly and firmly.",
      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

      "Health and tourism officials in Fiji say seven foreign tourists have been hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Seven foreign tourists were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar, Fijian authorities said on Monday.",
      "The cause of their illness was not known and officials said it was too soon to know if tainted alcohol was involved.",
      "Those who became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday included Australians and an American, according to local news reports. They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, said Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Two people remained in the hospital, conscious and in stable condition, Fiji's Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka told reporters on Monday. One person was discharged on Sunday and four others on Monday.",
      "David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalized, told Sky News Australia that his relatives had been released from the hospital and were due to fly home on Monday night.",
      "Local news outlets reported on Sunday that the cause of the foreigners' illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos in November in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming tainted drinks.",
      "But Tudravu said no cause had been identified in the Fiji episode. Police have ordered toxicology tests and are awaiting results \u2014 which are expected to take three or four days \u2014 Gavoka said.",
      "The bar was full of customers on Saturday night and many had ordered pi\u00f1a coladas, the drink consumed by those who became ill, said the official.",
      "Gavoka said no other reports of similar illness were recorded at the resort or across Fiji, a South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said. The hotel, located on the picturesque Coral Coast of the largest island, Viti Levu, has operated for many years and \u201cholds a strong reputation,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cThis is the only reported case of its kind that we\u2019ve experienced in recent memory, and certainly nothing like this has been experienced this year,\u201d Gavoka said.",
      "Australia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that officials are providing consular assistance to two Australian families in Fiji.",
      "The ministry did not comment on the cause of the Australians' illness, but its website advising tourists was updated on Monday to caution travelers about \u201cpotential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the resort, Savaira Molaucake, said staff were \u201cconducting a thorough investigation\u201d of the incident and were working closely with authorities."

      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks requiring Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",
      "During her first sober holiday season last year, Haydel reveled in meaningful conversations and the joy of waking up feeling good each morning with clear memories of the night before.",
      "\u201cSobriety is the gift that you keep on giving to your future self over and over and over again,\u201d says Eliott Edge, who manages Hekate, the sober bar.",
      "Focus on enjoying this very real gift, Baily says. Take your time getting dressed, visualizing yourself having a great time, and imagine how you\u2019ll feel as your head hits the pillow when you get home.",
      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best bits of the evening,\u201d Baily says, \u201cand there are no costs.\u201d"

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "The FBI statement didn\u2019t provide further detail about the nature of the tip or say when it was received but said agents in New York had \u201cconducted routine investigative activity and referred this and other leads to the New York City Police Department.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested Monday, Dec. 9, after an employee at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, phoned police saying that there was a person eating breakfast in the restaurant who looked like the person being sought as the gunman.",

    "story": [
      "McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work for opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according to court papers filed in Virginia",
      "BOSTON -- McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin, according to court papers filed in Virginia on Friday.",
      "As part of the deal with the U.S. Justice Department, McKinsey will avoid prosecution on criminal charges if it pays the sum and follows certain conditions for five years, including ceasing any work on the sale, marketing or promotion of controlled substances.",
      "A former McKinsey senior partner, Martin Elling, has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for deleting documents from his laptop after he became aware of investigations into Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin that was then a client, according to the filings. A lawyer for Elling declined to comment Friday.",
      "McKinsey said in a statement on Friday that it's \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for its work for Purdue Pharma.",
      "\u201cWe should have appreciated the harm opioids were causing in our society and we should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret for our firm.\u201d",
      "It's the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold accountable companies officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of them have been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis.",
      "Purdue paid McKinsey more than $93 million over 15 years for several products, including how to improve revenue from OxyContin. Prosecutors say McKinsey \u201cknew the risk and dangers\u201d of OxyContin and knew that Purdue Pharma executives had previously pleaded guilty to crimes related to the promotion of the drug, but decided to work with the opioid manufacturer anyway.",
      "One of the jobs for McKinsey, the papers said, was to identify which prescribers would generate the most additional prescriptions if Purdue salespeople focused on that. That resulted in prescriptions that \u201cwere not for a medically accepted indication, were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d the filing said.",
      "\u201cThis was not hypothetical,\" Christopher Kavanaugh, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said in a news conference in Boston on Friday. \u201cThis was not just marketing. It was a strategy. It was executed and it worked.\u201d",
      "During work to \u201cturbocharge\u201d Purdue sales in 2013 after a drop in business, McKinsey consultants accompanied Purdue sales representatives on visits to prescribers and pharmacies to gather information. In a note about one ride-along, a McKinsey consultant said one pharmacist had a gun \u201cand was shaking; abuse is definitely a huge issue.\u201d The company continued looking for ways to increase OxyContin sales, according to court papers.",
      "In 2014, McKinsey identified some small clinics that were writing more opioid prescriptions than entire hospital systems \u2014 and suggested they be targeted for more sales, the court filing said.",
      "The company also tried to help Purdue get a say in shaping federal rules intended to ensure the benefits of addictive prescription drugs outweighed the risks. The government said in its new filings that that resulted in making high-dose OxyContin subject to the same oversight as lower-dose opioids and made training for prescribers voluntary rather than mandatory.",
      "Since 2021, McKinsey has agreed to pay state and local governments about $765 million in settlements for its role in advising businesses on how to sell more of the powerful prescription painkillers amid a national opioid crisis.",
      "The firm also agreed last year to pay health care funds and insurance companies $78 million.",
      "Federal authorities say the deal represents the first time a management consulting firm is being held accountable like this for advising a client to break the law.",
      "\u201cIf a consulting first conspires with a client to engage in criminal conduct, the fact that you\u2019re an outside consultant will not protect you,\u201d said Joshua Levy, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts.",
      "Some advocates say the opioid crisis was touched off when Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin hit the market in 1996.",
      "Three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to misbranding charges in 2007 and the company agreed to pay a fine. The company pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2020 and agreed to $8.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures \u2014 most of which will be waived as long as it executes a settlement through bankruptcy court that is still in the works.",

      "An array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies were notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions that killed other inmates from disease and starvation, according to human rights groups, whistle-blowers, and former detainees.",
      "The White Helmets have received reports of at least 13 mass grave sites around the country, eight of them near Damascus, including Najha, al-Mustafa said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t open these mass graves yet. That is a massive task to document and take samples and give codes to the corpses before we can identify those people,\u201d he said.",
      "The priority is to take stock of the unidentified bodies above ground, those in hospital morgues and in clashes, al-Mustafa said.",
      "Rapp, who arrived in Syria on Monday, visited another suspected grave site, in al-Qutayfah, 37 kilometers (23 miles) north of the capital. He plans to meet with officials from the new transitional government installed since the lightning offensive on Damascus on Dec. 8 that forced Assad to flee the country. He intends to discuss ways to secure and eventually excavate the sites, gather samples from remains for identification and preserve thousands of documents discovered in many security branches and prisons.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a process. That is what I will be engaging with government representatives about,\u201d Rapp said. He said he will also see what the international community can do to assist the government in criminal prosecutions and in ensuring they meet international standards.",
      "On Monday, residents and medical teams began on their own digging up a mass grave in the village of Izraa in southern Daraa province. The remains of over 30 corpses were uncovered, and the teams estimated the total number could reach 70.",
      "Moussa Al-Zouebi, the head of the village\u2019s health directorate, said some of the people whose remains were uncovered were executed by \u201cshooting in the head, in the eye, or by burning.\u201d A local forensic team and rebel fighters handled bags of human remains as an excavator rumbled in the background, while relatives stood by.",
      "Relatives said they initially had hopes that they would find their loved ones in a prison. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,\u201d Mohammad Ghazaleh said at the mass grave site.",
      "The new authorities in Damascus have designated a hotline for people and ex-prisoners to identify locations and secret prisons used by Assad\u2019s government to find any trace of missing persons. The insurgents have freed thousands of prisoners in Damascus and other cities, including Aleppo, Homs and Hama.",
      "\u201cIt is understandable that the desperate family members will try to go to a site hoping that they find some sign of their relatives, some information,\u201d Rapp said. He said the same is happening with documents found at sites. \u201cAlthough that is understandable, it can be damaging to an investigation,\" he said.",
      "Rapp said the process of securing and cataloguing documents could take up to three months but identifying those buried in mass graves could take more than two years."

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing pressure to resign from his own Liberal Party after his top minister abruptly quit and criticized his handling of the budget",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing pressure to resign from his own Liberal Party after his top minister abruptly quit and criticized his handling of the budget. Trudeau has led the country for nearly a decade, but has become widely unpopular in recent years over a wide range of issues, including the high cost of living and rising inflation.",
      "There is no mechanism for Trudeau's party to force him out in the short-term. He could resign, or his party could be forced from power by a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote in Parliament that would trigger an election that would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party.",
      "If his party were to survive a vote in Parliament \u2014 which seems increasingly unlikely \u2014 Trudeau could choose to stay on as prime minister until there is an election.",
      "Here's a deeper look at the possible paths for Trudeau and Canada.",
      "If Trudeau resigns, which political analysts consider a likely scenario, the Liberals would need to choose an interim prime minister to lead the country at least until elections are held.",
      "It isn't clear yet who the most likely candidate would be for any interim role.",
      "Longer term, a person likely to seek power in the Liberal Party post-Trudeau is Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada, and later the Bank of England. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister.",
      "Another possible candidate is Trudeau\u2019s new finance minister, Dominic LeBlanc. The former public safety minister, and a close friend of Trudeau, LeBlanc recently joined the prime minister at a dinner with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Concerns about Trudeau's leadership were exacerbated Monday when Chrystia Freeland, the former finance minister, quit his Cabinet. Freeland was highly critical of Trudeau's handling of the economy in the face of steep tariffs threatened by Trump. Shortly before Freeland announced her decision, the country's housing minister also quit.",
      "\u201cMy guess is that if another minister or two goes, he\u2019s toast, he will be forced to resign,\" said Canadian historian Robert Bothwell.",
      "With voters deeply unhappy, Parliament has the authority to try to knock Trudeau's Liberal party from power by holding a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote that would trigger an early election. And if a majority of Parliament votes against his government, Trudeau would then be \u201cerased in the election,\u201d Bothwell said.",
      "The walls are rapidly closing in on Trudeau.",
      "Because Liberals don\u2019t hold an outright majority in the Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the leftist New Democratic Party to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has all but vanished \u2014 the NDP's leader has called on Trudeau to resign \u2014 and that clears the way for Parliament to vote \u201cno confidence.\u201d",
      "After Tuesday, Parliament will be shut for the holidays until late next month, and a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote could be scheduled sometime thereafter.",
      "The Conservative Party, which has a commanding lead in the polls over the Liberals, has not publicly called for Trudeau\u2019s resignation. And because of tactics the Liberal Party can deploy to delay a \u201cno confidence\u201d vote, Conservatives might not be able to force one for a couple of months, said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "A vote of no confidence would trigger an immediate election.",
      "The political winds are blowing heavily against Trudeau, but he could theoretically cling to power a while longer.",
      "While a growing number want him to resign, one longtime supporter, Liberal lawmaker James Maloney, said Trudeau has the support of his base in Parliament.",
      "If Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party survives no confidence votes in the coming months \u2014 an unlikely scenario \u2014 the latest the next federal election could be held is October 20.",
      "The odds of an election much sooner than that have gone up.",
      "\u201cI expect an election in late spring, unless Trudeau decides to dissolves Parliament and dives into an election before then,\u201d said Wiseman.",
      "With Liberals' grip on power fading, experts say the best they can hope for in the next election is to hold the Conservatives to a minority government that will be reliant on other parties to pass legislation. The latest polling from Nanos has the Conservatives leading the Liberals 43% to 23%, suggesting Conservatives could win a majority of the seats."

      "An Iranian official says authorities have paused the process of implementing a new, stricter law on women\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran has paused the process of implementing a new, stricter law on women\u2019s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, an official said \u2014 a bill that many believe could have reignited the protests that engulfed the Islamic Republic after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "The controversial law, which was approved by the parliament in September 2023, will not be sent to the government as planned this week, according to one of the country's vice presidents. The development effectively means that Iran has halted enacting the legislation.",
      "The law levies harsher punishments for women who refuse to wear the hijab and for businesses that serve them, penalties previously rejected by Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian as he tries to restart talks with the West over sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cAccording to the discussions held, it was decided that this law will not be referred to the government by the parliament for now,\u201d Shahram Dabiri, the vice president in charge of parliamentary affairs, was quoted as saying in an interview Monday with the pro-reform Ham Mihan daily.",
      "The decision to halt the legislation \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 was reached by top executive, legislative and judiciary bodies, Dabiri also said.",
      "At the moment, it is \u201cnot feasible to implement this bill,\u201d he added, without elaborating.",
      "Had the bill passed to the government, Iran's president would have had little room to maneuver. By law, he\u2019s required to endorse the bill within five days, after which it would have taken effect in 15 days. The president has no authority to veto it.",
      "Pezeshkian could try to convince Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, to halt the bill.",
      "If the bill had been enacted, Pezeshkian could also refuse to act on it or urge police not to enforce it, setting up a potential constitutional crisis that hard-liners could try to exploit to weaken him.",
      "The president had earlier described the law as having \u201cmany questions and ambiguities.\u201d",
      "Amini died on Sept. 16, 2022, after her arrest by the country\u2019s morality police over allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities.",
      "Iran has denied being responsible for her death and disputes she was beaten. However, United Nations investigators have concluded Amini \u201dwas subjected to physical violence that led to her death,\u201d which they blamed on the morality police.",
      "The monthslong security crackdown that followed Amini\u2019s death killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained.",
      "In the years since, Iranian women on the streets increasingly have ignored the existing hijab law, walking in public with their hair uncovered despite the threat of arrest or harassment.",
      "The new, 74-section law envisages fines of $800 for first offenses and $1,500 for second offenses, followed by prison terms of up to 15 years for third offenses. Also, celebrities and public figures could see the confiscation of 8% of their net worth, while businesses face the possibility of closure and fines for serving those not wearing a headscarf. Travel bans also would have been enacted for offenders.",
      "The law also would have allowed foreign nationals, including the millions of Afghans living in Iran, to work as informers reporting women not wearing the hijab. Business owners and taxi drivers would be encouraged to report on uncovered women. Otherwise, they can face cash fines.",
      "The scope of the law, which would be in place for three years, is extraordinary even for the Islamic Republic. It also includes allowing police access to private surveillance footage and even footage recorded by security forces, the Defense Ministry and the country\u2019s civilian nuclear agency.",

      "Economic Development Minister Adolfo Urso said that one reason for production lulls are new European rules that come into effect Jan. 1 that one-fifth of cars being produced must be electric vehicles, or face stiff fines. He called for the rules to be changed.",
      "Plants in Italy have been cycling through short-term layoff programs because of lagging sales, especially of electric vehicles.",
      "While unions welcomed the announcements, they remained skeptical that they would lead to a turnaround. They said the layoff schemes were likely to continue through next year.",
      "\u201cThere are not the conditions to say that we have entered a new phase,'' said Rocco Palombella, head of the Uilm union. \u201cPerhaps a new phase in industrial relations, but not a new phase guaranteeing factories, or to say the situation will improve from tomorrow.\u201d"

      "Gen. Ricardo Trevilla acknowledged that the army had already suffered six deaths from such improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, between 2018 and 2024. But he didn't specify whether those six had been killed by bombs dropped from drones, or by buried roadside bombs, both of which have been used by gangs in Mexico.",
      "Trevilla said that devices like the one that exploded Monday were \u201cvery rustic,\u201d and officials in the past have described them as similar to buried pipe bombs. There was no immediate information on the condition of the five wounded in the attack, which included at least one officer.",
      "Trevilla's description of the location where the two soldiers died Monday in the western state of Michoacan suggested that it may have been a sort of grisly drug cartel booby trap.",
      "Trevilla said the army sent out a patrol to check on reports that there was an encampment of armed men in a rural area. The armed forces detected an area protected by stockades that appeared to be an encampment, but when soldiers approached in vehicles, they found the trail blocked by logs, so they descended and had to approach on foot.",
      "While approaching, they spotted three dismembered bodies near the encampment, which appeared to be abandoned. But as they drew closer, a buried device exploded and struck the soldiers.",
      "Trevilla blamed the blast on the United Cartels, an umbrella group that includes the local Viagras gang, which has been fighting bloody turf battles against the Jalisco cartel in Michoacan for years.",

      "The son-in-law of a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for his role in a vast bribery conspiracy to siphon $1.2 billion from the state-owned oil company, some of which allegedly landed into accou...",
      "MIAMI -- The son-in-law of a prominent Venezuelan opposition leader was sentenced Tuesday to two and a half years in prison for his role in a vast conspiracy to siphon $1.2 billion from the state-owned oil company, some of which allegedly landed into accounts controlled by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2019s stepsons.",
      "Fernando Vuteff, 53, was arrested on a U.S. warrant in 2022 in Switzerland while on a visit to retrieve a valuable watch from a safe deposit box held at a bank in Zurich. The Argentine asset manager is the son-in-law of former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, a fierce Maduro opponent. He was charged in Miami federal court with laundering bribes and illicit proceeds from a fake foreign currency exchange scheme involving senior Venezuelan officials.",
      "Vuteff, in a November deposition to Swiss prosecutors, described feeling panicked when he learned that three sons of Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores from a previous relationship were behind financial accounts held in the name of four Scotland-registered shell companies he helped set up. The discovery came after a 2015 meeting he arranged for an associate in Malta at which \u201cLos Chamos\u201d \u2014 Venezuelan slang for \u201cthe kids\u201d \u2014 showed up unexpectedly.",
      "\u201cWe had to close the accounts. But it was very difficult to close these accounts because each account had over $100 million in it. Who would accept that amount of money so quickly?,\u201d Vuteff told the Swiss prosecutors in Miami, explaining how over the next two years he was pressured to gradually transfer the money out of the accounts.",
      "\u201cThis pressure included threats because of the political position these people had,\u201d he said, referring to Maduro\u2019s stepsons. \u201cThey weren\u2019t normal people.\u201d",
      "A transcript of the deposition was provided to The Associated Press by someone familiar with the investigation on the condition of anonymity since the Swiss investigation is ongoing.",
      "Corruption is rampant in Venezuela \u2014 the country trails only Somalia in a widely cited ranking of 180 countries for perceived levels of graft \u2014 and U.S. prosecutors have uncovered billions in fraud and bribes connected to top officials in recent years.",
      "But the prosecutorial pressure, which includes indictments for drug trafficking against Maduro and several aides, has done little to loosen the self-described socialist leader\u2019s grip on power. Maduro is set to be sworn in Jan. 10 for a third six-year term after claiming victory in this summer\u2019s presidential election despite widespread evidence his opponent won by a two-to-one margin.",
      "Meanwhile, the once abundant Venezuela caseload has dried, as several key prosecutors in Miami have resigned, the Justice Department has turned its attention to national security probes in China and Russia, and the Biden administration has dangled sanctions relief in a so far futile effort to entice Maduro into changing course.",
      "Vuteff\u2019s is one of the highest profile defendants to have been arrested as part of Operation Money Flight, a multi-year investigation led by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations targeting corruption inside Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. Several others remain fugitives including Vuteff\u2019s former boss, Ralph Steinmann, in a Swiss firm and one of their former clients, Ra\u00fal Gorr\u00edn, a billionaire media tycoon charged in October with ginning up a currency-exchange scheme using fake loan agreements to embezzle more than $1 billion from state-run oil company PDVSA at a time of collapsing crude production.",
      "Gorr\u00edn was previously charged in 2018 for his alleged involvement in a separate bribery case in which he is alleged to have paid bribes including yachts, private jets and champion show-jumping horses to two former Venezuelan National Treasurers.",
      "Now a convicted money launderer for billionaires, Vuteff came from humble beginnings, working from the age of 12 in a laundromat his family owned below the small apartment where they lived in rural Argentina.",
      "Defense attorney Brian Bieber said Vuteff felt deep remorse for his mistakes, actively cooperated with the government\u2019s investigation and had already paid dearly for his crimes by being unable to be at his parents\u2019 bedsides when they died due to travel restrictions.",
      "\u201cI know the decision in the past were wrong and I am not trying to find excuses to justify them,\" Vuteff, holding back tears, told Judge Darrin Gayles at Tuesday's sentencing.",
      "Prosecutors led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nalina Sombuntham had sought a sentence of 41 months.",
      "\u201cI know I can never undo the harm I have caused. But I can promise you that I have used this experience in my life to change,\u201d Vuteff added. \u201cMy only wish is to redeem myself.\"",
      "Twenty nine childhood friends, business associates and relatives of his Venezuelan wife also wrote letters to the court seeking leniency. Conspicuously absent was any letter from Vuteff\u2019s father-in-law, Ledezma, who led massive protests against the government before being arrested in 2015 on allegations he was plotting a coup. Ledezma fled house arrest in 2017 and took up residency in Spain, where Vuteff was living prior to his arrest.",
      "\u201cI have learned to love Fernando like a son,\u201d Ledezma's wife, Victoria Capriles, told Judge Gayles at Tuesday's sentencing. \u201cHe has earned my trust, our affection.\u201d",
      "As part of his plea agreement earlier this year, Vuteff agreed to forfeit over $4 million in unlawfully obtained assets, including real estate in Miami, Spain and Paraguay.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israeli forces will stay in a buffer zone on the Syrian border, and specifically on the summit of Mount Hermon, \u201cuntil another arrangement is found that will ensure Israel\u2019s security.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu made the comments from the mountain's summit \u2014 the highest peak in the area \u2014 which is inside Syria, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with the Israel-held Golan Heights.",
      "This was apparently the first time a sitting Israeli leader had set foot this far into Syria. Netanyahu said he had been on the summit of Mount Hermon 53 years ago as a soldier, but the summit\u2019s importance to Israel\u2019s security has only increased given recent events.",
      "Israel seized a swath of southern Syria along the border with the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights in the days after Syrian President Bashar Assad was ousted by rebels.",
      "Israel\u2019s capture of the buffer zone, a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized area in Syrian territory, has sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating a 1974 ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria in the wake of Assad's ouster to make a land grab.",
      "Netanyahu traveled to the buffer zone with Defense Minister Israel Katz, who said he instructed the Israeli military to quickly establish a presence including fortifications, in anticipation of what could be an extended stay in the area.",
      "\u201cThe summit of the Hermon is the eyes of the state of Israel to identify our enemies who are nearby and far away,\u201d Katz said.",
      "An Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said there is no plan to evacuate the Syrians living in villages within the buffer zone.",
      "The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then.",
      "A U.N. spokesman said Tuesday that the advance of Israeli troops, however long it lasts, violates the 1974 deal that set up the buffer zone.",
      "That agreement \u201cneeds to be respected, and occupation is occupation, whether it lasts a week, a month or a year, it remains occupation,\u201d spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the insurgent group that led the ouster of Assad, or from Arab states.",
      "Israel still controls the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed \u2014 a move not recognized by most of the international community. Mount Hermon's summit is divided between the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel\u2019s control of the Golan Heights.",
      "With Assad now banished, bodies of more than 30 Syrians who vanished under his rule were uncovered in a mass grave on Monday. Forensic teams and rebels worked together to unearth the remains in the village of Izraa, north of the city of Daraa, as families of the missing stood by.",
      "The relatives said they had initially hoped to find their loved ones in prison.",
      "\u201cBut we didn\u2019t find anyone and it broke our hearts. They were burned alive here after being doused in fuel,\u201d said Mohammad Ghazaleh, who was waiting at the mass grave site.",
      "Some of the bodies recovered showed evidence that they had been shot in the head or burned, said Moussa Al-Zouebi, head of Izraa\u2019s health directorate.",
      "Syria's new authorities have set up a hotline for reporting missing persons and secret detention sites.",
      "In the Syrian capital of Damascus, Qatar officially reopened its embassy on Tuesday \u2014 nearly 13 years after it severed diplomatic relations with Assad's government.",
      "Qatar had reaffirmed its \u201ccategorical rejection of the regime\u2019s repressive policies against the Syrian people\u201d in a statement earlier. Most foreign embassies in Syria have been shut down since after the country\u2019s civil war erupted in 2011.",
      "The French Embassy in Damascus raised its flag Tuesday in a \u201csymbolic gesture\u201d to show support for the Syrian people during the transition. It's reopening is pending ongoing evaluation of political and security conditions, French Foreign Minister French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said.",

      "\u201cThe pantomime dame is the beating heart of the show,\u201d said Simon Sladen, curator of theater and performance at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum. \u201cShe is that engine that drives it. Firstly with pace and anarchy, but also a little bit of sauce on the side.\u201d",
      "An estimated 3 million people in Britain attend a pantomime each year, in venues ranging from small regional theaters to London West End playhouses. Many theaters rely on them for a big chunk of their annual income.",
      "When London\u2019s theaters were closed for months by pandemic lockdowns in 2020, panto dames led a protest march through the city to stress their importance to the creative economy.",
      "They provide seasonal work to faded pop stars, television entertainers, the occasional Hollywood celebrity \u2014 Pamela Anderson took Liverpool by storm when she starred in \u201cAladdin\u201d in 2010, singing \u201cSanta Baby\u201d while suspended on a swing above the stage, dressed in costumes by Vivienne Westwood.",
      "They are also vital experience for many young actors, including the A-listers of tomorrow.",
      "Jude Law told The Associated Press recently that he\u2019d played Humpty Dumpty, recalling his performance as \u201cloud and round.\u201d At 17, Michael Fassbender played one of Cinderella\u2019s Ugly Sisters, and a tree.",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Jonathan Bailey starred alongside a young Nicholas Hoult in a production of \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Hoult also appeared in \u201cMother Goose\u201d as a child, and says he would happily do another, as they\u2019re \u201creally fun.\u201d",
      "Asked to sum up the art form, Bailey called it a \u201cquintessentially British bloody good time for all the family.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s pantos often strive to reflect diversity, both onstage and in the audience. Rowe, whose Hackney Empire pantos draw many of their cast and crew from Britain\u2019s Black communities, said that at its core the genre is \u201cabout acceptance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding, it\u2019s about the idea that being different isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be brought in and kind of celebrated and that no matter where you are in society, from the youngest to the oldest, we all have a place and we should embrace that.\u201d",
      "Drag performer Ginger Johnson, starring in an adult \u201call-drag panto\u201d version of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d at London\u2019s Phoenix Theatre, said that panto\u2019s ability to change is \u201cwhy it\u2019s managed to survive for so long as a cultural form.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think for a lot of kids, panto is the first time that they come in contact with drag as well,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Stage historian Sladen said that some are leaning into the drag element of panto, with \u201ca bigger, wider explosion of roles than just the dame and the principal boy being cross-dressed.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe might see the fairy godmother played by a dame or played by a drag artist. We might see a wicked stepmother, also played by a very well-known drag performer. So (it\u2019s) constantly evolving, constantly changing with the times.\u201d",

      "Leading contenders in Germany\u2019s upcoming election have presented their programs, setting out contrasting visions of how to put new vigor into Europe\u2019s biggest economy and tackle other issues such as migration",
      "BERLIN -- Leading contenders in Germany's upcoming election presented their programs on Tuesday, setting out contrasting visions of how to put new vigor into Europe's biggest economy and tackle other issues such as migration.",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a center-left Social Democrat, will seek a second term in the parliamentary election expected on Feb. 23 \u2014 more than three months after his unpopular three-party coalition collapsed in a dispute about how to revive the stagnant economy. He hopes for a come-from-behind victory against center-right challenger Friedrich Merz, whose Union bloc leads all recent polls.",
      "Also seeking the top job are Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, Scholz's remaining coalition partner; and Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly but has no realistic chance of governing because other parties refuse to work with it.",
      "The Social Democrats, Union and Greens all hope to implement as much as they can of their programs presented Tuesday, but any new government will almost certainly be a coalition and require extensive compromises.",
      "The Union is pledging tax cuts for individuals and companies and wants to raise the level at which the highest level of income tax, 42%, kicks in. It wants to make working overtime more financially attractive. It also wants to abolish a tax once paid by everyone to finance the costs of integrating the former East Germany, now levied only on higher earners. It hopes to free up money by reforming the benefit system for the long-term unemployed and getting more people into jobs. It also wants to cut the value-added tax rate on dining out.",
      "Scholz's Social Democrats pledge a lower income tax burden for 95% of earners. They want to reduce value-added tax on groceries. The Social Democrats and Greens want to increase the national minimum wage, which will be 12.82 euros ($13.47) per hour on election day, to 15 euros \u2014 reprising an issue both parties campaigned on in 2021. Scholz's party wants a \u201cmade in Germany bonus\u201d to encourage investment in new plants and equipment. It also wants to set up a \u201cGermany fund\u201d to invest public and private money in energy networks, innovative companies and building new homes. The Greens propose something similar to finance spending on infrastructure and want the \u201csuper-rich\u201d to make a bigger contribution, for example to help finance education. All the contenders have proposals to reduce electricity prices.",
      "The Social Democrats and Greens want to reform Germany's self-imposed restrictions on borrowing \u2014 the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d introduced more than a decade ago, which allows new borrowing to the tune of only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product, though it can be suspended for emergencies that are out of the state's control. The two center-left parties, which are vague about how exactly they would modify it, argue that it has become a barrier to investment.",
      "The \u201cdebt brake\u201d played a part in the collapse of Scholz's coalition in November. The chancellor's former coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, insisted on upholding it strictly. The Union wants to hang on to it, arguing that it already has proven its flexibility in times of crisis and prevents Germany from burdening future generations with debt. But Merz has signaled that he might eventually be open to a future reform.",
      "The Union wants Germany to turn back at its border migrants trying to enter from other countries in Europe's free travel zone and seek asylum. It wants to increase deportations of migrants who aren't entitled to stay and designate more \u201csafe countries of origin,\u201d allowing authorities to speed up asylum proceedings. It is pledging to reverse legislation approved under Scholz that eased the rules on gaining citizenship and ended restrictions on holding dual citizenship.",
      "The Social Democrats argue that measures the government has taken, including border controls, are already reducing irregular migration significantly. The Greens want a \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cbinding\u201d distribution of asylum-seekers in Europe.",
      "Germany is Ukraine's top military supplier in Europe and its biggest after the United States. All three leading contenders pledge continued aid, but there are differences of emphasis. Scholz says he wants Germany to remain the biggest supplier in Europe but is touting his \u201cprudence\u201d in ensuring that the war doesn't expand into a conflict between Russia and NATO and underlining his insistence that he won't supply long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv.",
      "The Union and the Greens have been more open to sending the long-range missiles. The Union wants to set up a \u201ccontact group\u201d with France, Poland and the U.K. to consult with the United States on a strategy to support Ukraine and provide \u201ccredible security guarantees.\u201d",
      "Current polls suggest it's likely that at least two of the Union, Social Democrats and Greens will end up having to govern together.",
      "\u201cWe want to become so strong in this election ... that others have to ask themselves whether they are prepared to work together with us, and we aren't the ones who have to adapt to others and run after them,\u201d Merz said Tuesday."

      "\u201cThe first term, everybody was fighting me,\u201d Trump said in remarks at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cIn this term, everybody wants to be my friend.\u201d",
      "Tech companies and leaders have now poured millions into his inauguration fund, a sharp increase \u2014 in most cases \u2014 from past pledges to incoming presidents. But what does the tech industry expect to gain out of their renewed relationships with Trump?",

      "Stellantis European chief Jean-Philippe Imparato told the economic, labor and economic development ministers that Turin would become the headquarters of the carmakers\u2019 European operations from January, addressing a concern among Italian officials and unions since the merger that the automaker\u2019s center of gravity had shifted.",

      "New England shrimp will come back to seafood counters in small amounts next year under a research fishing program",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- New England shrimp, long lost from the marketplace as waters have warmed, will come back to seafood counters in small amounts next year due to a research fishing program.",
      "Also called Maine shrimp or northern shrimp, the small pink crustaceans were long beloved by seafood fans in winter. But for a decade now, the seafood industry has been under a fishing moratorium for the shrimp because of concerns about low population levels, which scientists attribute to climate change and warming oceans.",
      "That moratorium is going to remain in place as the shrimp population has failed to improve, according to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Yet because the regulatory body said there is interest in collecting data about the shrimp, this coming winter there will be a fishing industry-funded winter sampling program for them.",
      "The program will allow fishermen to catch up to 58,400 pounds (26,490 kilograms) of the shrimp this winter. It's a far cry from the early 2010s when fishermen caught more than 10 million pounds (4.5 million kilograms) of the shrimp per year. But the program will provide important data to better understand the status of the shrimp population while also allowing a small amount of catch, the commission said.",
      "\u201cThe sampling program is intended to run early in the new year from mid/late January through March 2025. Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts are currently working together to finalize the logistics of the program including the start date,\u201d said Chelsea Tuohy, a fishery management plan coordinator with the commission, on Tuesday.",
      "Fishermen long sought the cold water-loving shrimp in the Gulf of Maine, a body of water off New England that has experienced significant warmth in recent years. The commission said in a statement that recent science has found \u201cno improvement in stock status\u201d for the shrimp. The commission has also described the Gulf of Maine as \u201can increasingly inhospitable environment\" for the shrimp."

      "Small business owners should not forget about a rule that requires them to register with an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1",
      "Small business owners should not forget about a rule \u2014 currently in legal limbo \u2014 that would require them to register with an agency called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by Jan. 1.",
      "The registration is part of the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money laundering statue passed in 2021. Under the CTA, the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address.",
      "Registering isn't difficult, but if a small business owner is unaware of the requirement, they could be slapped with penalties of up to $10,000. Businesses with more than 20 employees and more than $5 million in sales can qualify for exemptions.",
      "For now, the rule is on hold. On Dec. 3 a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the rule. FinCen has said registering is voluntary. But the injunction could be overturned on appeal, so small business owners should keep an eye on the case.",
      "The act was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \u201ccriminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "Originally, the rules became effective in 2024 and gave existing businesses until Jan. 1, 2025, to register. However, businesses that started in 2024 were given 90 days to register.",
      "Doris Dike, a principal at Dike Law Group in Frisco, Texas, that works with small business healthcare clients, said she is concerned about the rule going into effect in 2025.",
      "\u201cFinCEN is intrusive, and I\u2019m relieved that it\u2019s temporarily on hold. I\u2019m not convinced it would combat money-laundering,\" she said. \u201cThere\u2019s already laws in place for recording business ownership. FINCEN is burdensome and would create fear among small businesses.\u201d",
      "Jennifer Barnes, owner and CEO of San Diego-based accounting firm Optima Office, with 97 employees, said she might register even though the rule is temporarily on hold.",
      "\u201cA recent stay regarding FinCen\u2019s Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting is just that \u2013 a stay. It is not a definitive determination on the merits of the requirement,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cTherefore, the prudent course of action is to file before the previously determined deadline on Jan. 1 as there is no guarantee of a deadline extension if the stay is overturned.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "People worried they'll never get a scarce human transplant want to know when they might get a pig kidney instead",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The calls and emails started coming into NYU Langone Health and Massachusetts General Hospital soon after doctors began experimenting with pig organs in humans.",
      "People worried they\u2019ll never get a scarce human transplant asked: When could we get a pig kidney?",
      "Alex Berrios of Louisville, Kentucky, needs a second transplant but finding another human match is proving impossible. So he's closely watching for a chance at pig kidney research.",
      "\"It may not work, and I have to be OK with that,\u201d Berrios said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the shot.\u201d",
      "Now two U.S. companies aim to begin the world\u2019s first clinical trials of xenotransplantation in 2025 \u2013 using pig kidneys or hearts to try to save human lives. Would-be volunteers are impatient to see if they'll qualify as researchers fine-tune how best to test if the humanized pig organs they\u2019ve designed might really work.",
      "Anticipation is growing with news that an Alabama woman was faring well after a pig kidney transplant at NYU in late November. Towana Looney is the fifth American to receive a gene-edited pig organ, each case so far an emergency experiment for people out of options.",
      "None of the previous recipients \u2014 two given pig hearts and two kidneys \u2014 survived more than two months but that hasn't deterred researchers hunting an alternative to the dire shortage of transplantable organs.",
      "\u201cWe have to have the courage to continue,\u201d said University of Maryland transplant surgeon Dr. Bartley Griffith.",
      "Back in 2022, Griffith had a hard time figuring out how to ask a dying patient if he\u2019d consider undergoing the world\u2019s first transplant of a gene-edited pig heart.",
      "\u201cI was so afraid to mention the word pig heart,\u201d Griffith said. He marveled that patient David Bennett responded with a joke about oinking and made clear if the last-ditch attempt failed that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll learn something for others like me.\u201d",
      "Fast forward to late 2023, when patients at a National Kidney Foundation meeting with FDA officials and pig developers described a life so miserable on dialysis that they, too, would chance an animal organ.",
      "\u201cWhy not try? That was really what we took back,\u201d said Mike Curtis, CEO of eGenesis, one of the companies developing organs. \u201cIt was like we really almost have an obligation to try.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe patients pushed us to go ahead,\u201d agreed Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, a Mass General surgeon who\u2019d been reluctant to even broach the idea \u2013 but last March, four months after that meeting, gave a longtime patient the first gene-edited pig kidney.",
      "In Palm Springs, California, Carl McNew emailed NYU to ask about volunteering while he\u2019s still fairly healthy.",
      "McNew donated a kidney to his husband in 2015 but later his remaining kidney began declining, something very rare in living donors. Medications and intermittent dialysis are helping but McNew knows he\u2019ll eventually need a transplant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just something about being part of something like that, that is so cutting-edge,\u201d said McNew, who spotted news of NYU\u2019s xenotransplant research in 2023 and emailed his interest.",
      "For Louisville\u2019s Berrios, donor scarcity isn\u2019t the only hurdle. Born with a single kidney that failed in his late 20s, a living donor transplant restored his health for 13 years. But it failed in 2020 and he has since developed antibodies that would destroy another human kidney, what doctors call \u201chighly sensitized.\u201d",
      "Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Berrios quietly slips out of his home before dawn to spend nearly four hours tethered to a dialysis machine. Getting the grueling treatments at 5 a.m. is the only way the father of two can both stay alive and hold down a fulltime job.",
      "But dialysis doesn\u2019t fully replace kidney function \u2013 people slowly get sicker. So even as Berrios tried an experimental therapy to tamp down his problem antibodies, he told NYU he's interested in a pig kidney.",
      "FDA rules require that pig organs be extensively tested in monkeys or baboons before humans. And while researchers have extended those primates\u2019 survival to a year, sometimes longer, they were desperate for experience with people. After all, the pig organs are genetically altered to be more humanlike, not more baboon-like.",
      "At NYU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, surgeons first tested pig organs in bodies of the recently deceased, donated for scientific research.",
      "And patients given pig organs so far have been \u201ccompassionate use\u201d transplants, experiments that FDA allows in select emergency cases for people out of other options.",
      "Although the first four didn\u2019t survive long, in part because of complications from other diseases, those experiments proved pig organs could work at least for a while and offered other lessons. For example, discovery of a hidden pig virus in the first heart transplant prompted better tests for that risk.",
      "Only rigorous studies comparing similarly ill patients will offer a clearer picture of pig organs\u2019 potential \u2013 maybe those like Looney. Despite eight years of dialysis, she wasn\u2019t nearly as sick as prior xenotransplant recipients but couldn\u2019t find a matching donor. Like Berrios, she had a highly sensitized immune response.",
      "Looney may be \u201ckind of a litmus test\u201d for trial candidates, said NYU\u2019s Montgomery, who led her transplant with her original surgeon in Alabama, Dr. Jayme Locke. \u201cShe\u2019s received the transplant at just the right time,\u201d before dialysis did too much damage.",
      "Scientists have tried animal-to-human transplants for years without success but now they can edit pig genes, trying to bridge the species gap enough to keep the human immune system from immediately attacking the foreign tissue. Still, nobody knows the best gene combination.",
      "Revivicor, a United Therapeutics subsidiary, produces kidneys and hearts with 10 gene edits, \u201cknocking out\u201d pig genes that trigger hyper-rejection and excessive organ growth and adding some human genes to improve compatibility. Maryland used hearts with 10 gene edits in its two xenotransplants. Looney also got a kidney with 10 gene edits, based on Locke\u2019s research when she worked in Alabama.",
      "While Montgomery is thrilled with Looney\u2019s progress, he's done most work using Revivicor pigs with just one gene edit, in a xenotransplant last April and in research with the deceased.",
      "\u201cOur feeling is, you know, less is more,\u201d said Montgomery, noting it\u2019s easier to mass produce pigs with fewer gene alterations. Looney\u2019s transplant offers a chance to compare \u201creally how much difference those additional gene edits are making.\u201d",
      "In Boston, eGenesis has still another approach \u2013 a whopping 69 gene edits. In addition to 10 genetic alterations to improve human compatibility, genes linked to certain pig viruses also are inactivated.",
      "Researchers feel pressure to show if pig organs can keep people alive much longer than a few months, said eGenesis' Curtis. If not, the question will be \u201cdo we have the right gene edits?\u201d",
      "The balance is choosing participants sick enough to qualify but not so sick they have no chance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous number of patients who would be very willing, very willing to do this,\u201d said Dr. Silke Niederhaus of the University of Maryland, who isn\u2019t involved in xenotransplant research but watches it closely.",
      "Niederhaus became a kidney transplant surgeon because around her 12th birthday, one saved her life. That kidney lasted three decades. When it failed, it took five years to find another. So she understands the draw of pig research, and urges people to learn their odds of getting a human kidney before volunteering.",
      "If they\u2019re younger, healthier or have a living donor, \u201cI would probably say go with what\u2019s known and what\u2019s proven,\u201d Niederhaus said. But if they\u2019re older and dialysis is starting to fail, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s worth taking the risk.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Consumers stepped up their spending at retail stores last month, providing a boost to the economy in the early phases of the winter holiday shopping season",
      "WASHINGTON -- Consumers stepped up their spending at retail stores last month, providing a boost to the economy in the early phases of the winter holiday shopping season.",
      "Retail sales rose 0.7% in November, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, a solid increase and higher than October's 0.5% gain. Sales jumped 2.6% at auto dealers, driving most of the gain. Some of that demand likely reflected a need for new cars in parts of the southeast slammed by Hurricane Helene in October, as well as healthy incentives provided by car dealers. Big discounts at many retail chains also attracted some consumers.",
      "The boost in spending underscores that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace even with higher interest rates, a trend that could cause the Federal Reserve to lower borrowing costs more slowly next year than they have previously signaled. The Fed will announce its latest rate decision Wednesday.",
      "At the same time, there were some signs of consumer caution, as sales at grocery stores, clothing shops, and restaurants fell. Outside of car dealers and online retailers, sales gains were modest.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately expect this will be a decent holiday sales season for retailers,\u201d Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo, said in a note to clients. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to knock anyone\u2019s socks off in the wake of record pandemic gains, but continued consumer momentum means it\u2019s unlikely to be overly weak either.\u201d",
      "The economy expanded at nearly a 3% annual pace in the July-September quarter and some economists forecast steady growth in the final three months of this year as well. There are some signs of sluggishness in the job market, as hiring has weakened since early this year, but layoffs are also relatively rare and the unemployment rate is at a low 4.2%. Paychecks are growing a solid 4% pace, on average nationwide, which is modestly faster than inflation and helps fuel more spending.",
      "Sales rose modestly at stores selling furniture, electronics, and home and garden supplies. Since the retail sales report isn't adjusted for inflation, some of the increase reflects higher prices. Sporting goods stores reported a 0.9% gain. Sales at online retailers jumped 1.8%.",
      "Spending at restaurants and bars, meanwhile, dropped 0.4%, a sign that consumers did pull back in one discretionary category. Grocery store sales also dipped 0.2%.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed is expected to cut its key rate for a third time this year, after a big half-point cut in September and a quarter-point last month. But Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are also expected to signal that they may reduce their rate only two or three times next year, leaving it far above its pre-pandemic level, when rates on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards were much slower.",
      "The retail sales report comes as retailers are stepping up deals and other perks to get shoppers into their stores for the crucial final stretch before Christmas.",
      "Analysts envisioned a solid holiday shopping season, though perhaps not as robust as last year\u2019s, with many shoppers under pressure from still-high prices despite the easing of inflation. Overall, retailers had a decent start to the unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping period despite lots of discounts and sales that started as early as October.",
      "Adobe reported earlier this month that \u201ccyber week\u201d \u2014 the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday \u2014 brought in\u202f$41.1 billion\u202fonline overall, up\u202f8.2% from the year-ago period. Adobe expects full holiday season sales \u2014 Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 \u2014 to hit\u202f $240.8 billion, up 8.4% compared to a year-ago. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago.",
      "This year, retailers are feeling more pressure since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Moreover, the presidential election caused some distraction from shopping, sending sales of general merchandise down 9% in the two weeks ended Nov. 9, according to Circana, a market research group.",
      "Sales have been rebounding but stores will still have to make up for those losses. But there are big shopping days ahead. In the United States, the top 10 busiest shopping days account for approximately 30% to 40% of all holiday retail traffic, according to Sensormatic Solutions, which tracks foot traffic at retail stores. And five of the top ten busiest days during the holiday season are ahead still on the way, including the day after Christmas, Sensormatic said.",
      "Spencer Jordan, senior vice president of leasing at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio, said that foot traffic is unchanged from a year ago, but sales are up.",
      "There were steady crowds over the weekend at the Newport Centre Mall in Jersey City, New Jersey, anchored by Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, with huge discounts being offered at a number of them.",

      "An Alabama woman received a pig kidney transplant last month and is free from dialysis for the first time in eight years",
      "NEW YORK -- An Alabama woman is recovering well after a pig kidney transplant last month that freed her from eight years of dialysis, the latest effort to save human lives with animal organs.",
      "Towana Looney is the fifth American given a gene-edited pig organ \u2014 and notably, she isn\u2019t as sick as prior recipients who died within two months of receiving a pig kidney or heart.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a new beginning,\u201d Looney, 53, told The Associated Press. Right away, \u201cthe energy I had was amazing. To have a working kidney \u2014 and to feel it \u2014 is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Looney\u2019s surgery marks an important step as scientists get ready for formal studies of xenotransplantation expected to begin next year, said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led the highly experimental procedure on Nov. 25.",
      "On Tuesday, NYU announced that Looney is recuperating well. She was discharged from the hospital just 11 days after surgery although she was temporarily readmitted this week to adjust her medications. Doctors expect her to return home to Gadsden, Alabama, in three months. If the pig kidney were to fail, she could begin dialysis again.",
      "\u201cTo see hope restored to her and her family is extraordinary,\u201d said Dr. Jayme Locke, Looney's original surgeon who secured Food and Drug Administration permission for the transplant.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney. Thousands die waiting and many more who need a transplant never qualify. Now, searching for an alternate supply, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike.",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed. It\u2019s incredibly rare for living donors to develop kidney failure although those who do are given extra priority on the transplant list.",
      "But Looney couldn't get a match \u2014 she had developed antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney. Tests showed she\u2019d reject every kidney donors have offered.",
      "Then Looney heard about pig kidney research at t he University of Alabama at Birmingham and told Locke, at the time a UAB transplant surgeon, she'd like to try one. In April 2023, Locke filed an FDA application seeking an emergency experiment, under rules for people like Looney who are out of options.",
      "The FDA didn't agree right away. Instead, the world's first gene-edited pig kidney transplants went to two sicker patients last spring, at Massachusetts General Hospital and NYU. Both also had serious heart disease. The Boston patient recovered enough to spend about a month at home before dying of sudden cardiac arrest deemed unrelated to the pig kidney. NYU\u2019s patient had heart complications that damaged her pig kidney, forcing its removal, and she later died.",
      "Those disappointing outcomes didn\u2019t dissuade Looney, who was starting to feel worse on dialysis but, Locke said, hadn't developed heart disease or other complications. The FDA eventually allowed her transplant at NYU, where Locke collaborated with Montgomery.",
      "Moments after Montgomery sewed the pig kidney into place, it turned a healthy pink and began producing urine.",
      "Even if her new organ fails, doctors can learn from it, Looney told the AP: \u201cYou don't know if it's going to work or not until you try.\u201d",
      "Blacksburg, Virginia-based Revivicor provided Looney\u2019s new kidney from a pig with 10 gene alterations. Its parent company, United Therapeutics said Tuesday it plans to file an application with the FDA \u201cvery soon\u201d to begin clinical trials with that type of kidney.",
      "Looney was initially discharged on Dec. 6, wearing monitors to track her blood pressure, heart rate and other bodily functions and returning to the hospital for daily checkups before her medication readmission. Doctors scrutinize her bloodwork and other tests, comparing them to prior research in animals and a few humans in hopes of spotting an early warning if problems crop up.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing for the first time,\u201d Montgomery said.",
      "Locke, who recently joined the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, visited last week to check her longtime patient's progress. Looney hugged her, saying, \u201cThank you for not giving up on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever,\u201d Locke responded.",

      "Ireland's Data Protection Commission issued the penalties after wrapping up its inquiry into the breach, when hackers gained access to user accounts by exploiting bugs in the platform\u2019s code that allowed them to steal digital keys, known as \u201caccess tokens.\u201d",
      "Under the 27-nation EU\u2019s strict privacy regime, the Irish watchdog is Meta's lead privacy regulator because the company's regional headquarters are based in Dublin.",

      "\u201cThis decision relates to an incident from 2018. We took immediate action to fix the problem as soon as it was identified,\u201d Meta said in a statement. The company said it \u201cproactively informed people impacted\u201d as well as the Irish watchdog.",
      "When it first disclosed the problem, Facebook said 50 million user accounts were affected. But the actual number was around 29 million, including 3 million in Europe, the Irish watchdog said Tuesday.",

      "The hack involved three distinct bugs in Facebook\u2019s \u201cView As\u201d feature, which let people see how their profiles appear to others. The attackers used the vulnerability to steal access tokens from the accounts of people whose profiles came up in searches using the \u201cView As\u201d feature. The attack then moved from one user\u2019s Facebook friend to another. Possession of those tokens would allow attackers to control those accounts."

    "story": [
      "Boston is planning to renovate a crumbling stadium in one of the city's most diverse neighborhoods for its new professional women's soccer team",
      "BOSTON -- As the quarterback for the storied Boston Latin Academy, Jack Shapiro has long relished playing some of his high school games at historic White Stadium.",
      "But this season, the closest Shapiro will get to the 75-year-old stadium is a grassy practice field in the shadows of the 10,000-seat facility. The stadium gates are padlocked most days in anticipation of the dilapidated stadium being renovated. In its place will be a glistening, $200 million sports facility for Boston's new professional women's soccer team, BOS Nation FC, starting in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all a little disappointed not to have our home this year,\u201d said Shapiro, quarterback and safety for the high school team which was forced to play its home games in West Roxbury, a 45-minute bus ride from school. The city\u2019s school system will have access to the new facility, but Boston Latin and another school will play elsewhere.",
      "The team said it is still hopeful of playing some games at the new stadium but that remains far from certain.",
      "The city has said that Latin and another high school team, which rely on White Stadium for home games, will have to play elsewhere due to potential damage to the playing surface from cleats. But they have promised that all city schools could play end-of-season games, including championship games, there.",
      "\u201cThe biggest worry is that we will be blocked out,\u201d the team's coach, Rocco Zizza, said as he stood outside the stadium. \u201cIn many ways, what is behind us will not only be a monument for high school football but also maybe a tombstone.\u201d",
      "Shapiro and his team are part of the growing opposition to the joint venture that includes preservationists, environmentalists and neighborhood activists.",
      "Many opponents fear the public would lose access to the stadium, and the critical green space where it sits, if the city teams up with a corporate entity. Supporters argue their plan is the best hope to bringing women's professional soccer to Boston and providing new equipment and facilities for the city's cash-strapped school system.",
      "Surrounded by some of the most diverse and impoverished neighborhoods, White Stadium has long been a refuge for residents to take morning walks, play high school sports, see concerts, attend rallies or send their children to summer camps. The nearly 530-acre (214.48-hectare) Franklin Park, which is also home to the Franklin Park Zoo, is part of the Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s Emerald Necklace system of parks in the city.",
      "Louis Elisa, who lives across the street from the park and is party to the lawsuit attempting to halt the project, said the project will cause \u201cenormous harm to the environment and the community.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit argues the process to approve the project was rushed without adequate community input and violates the state constitution by transferring public land for a private use. Opponents also argue the thousands of fans attending BOS Nation FC games would overwhelm the park and cause widespread traffic and noise problems to nearby neighborhoods.",
      "Instead, they are pushing for repairing the stadium for students at a cost of less than $20 million.",
      "\u201cThe changes that they want to make is going to destroy the antiquities of the park, going to change the character of the park,\u201d said Elisa, president of the Garrison-Trotter Neighborhood Association.",
      "Supporters, led by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, argue the partnership is the only way to fund much-needed renovations and would bring positive change to the neighborhood and the students who rely on facility. Repeated efforts in recent decades to repair the stadium have faltered over a lack of funds, design concerns and neighborhood opposition.",
      "The stadium will be controlled by the city\u2019s schools but the cost of operating and maintaining it will be the team's responsibility.",
      "\u201cThe stadium has been in bad need of repairs and renovation for a very long time. You can see the track is crumbling, the facilities aren't up to state standards. Our young people deserve better,\u201d Wu said, adding that the project aligns with the purpose of the park which has areas of urban wilds meant for quiet enjoyment and other parts like the stadium that \u201cwere meant to draw people in.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will revitalize the mission that we've always had for White Stadium to be a hub for our young people, for our student athletes and the community around them,\u201d she continued.",
      "Jennifer Epstein, the controlling owner of the team which will play in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, said the stadium project allows for the team to \u201cplay in the heart of the city\u201d and forge a closer ties to the school system and the community.",
      "She estimated the new stadium will offer tens of thousands of students three times more programming than they get now, and double the access for the community. It would also be one of the few stadiums built specifically for professional women's soccer \u2014 the New England Revolution, the men's team, is moving forward on a new Boston-based facility of their own.",
      "\u201cThis public-private-community partnership is really exciting and it's going to turn White Stadium into a top tier professional stadium,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIt will be a real thrill for everyone to be there.\u201d",
      "The debate over the stadium has played out at scores of meeting and hundreds of conversations over the past 17 months. So far, supporters have won every round of the permitting process and the city is hoping to sign a lease in the coming weeks and for demolition to start soon after.",
      "But lately, supporters have run into unexpected challenges.",
      "Wu acknowledged this week that the city's price tag for the renovation \u2014 the cost are being split evenly between the team and the city \u2014 has nearly doubled to $91 million due to design changes and rising construction costs. On Tuesday, Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn came out against the proposal, citing the growing costs.",
      "\u201cWe should cancel this proposal immediately and work together with residents and stakeholders across the city to provide the best option not only for our city and supporting a professional women\u2019s soccer team, but one that incorporates the voice of our residents and student athletes as well,\u201d Flynn said in a statement.",
      "Time is also an issue, with supporters warning in court documents that any delays to the March trial on the lawsuit puts the project at risk. Supporters are optimistic the lawsuit will eventually be dismissed.",
      "The team is also seeking input on the team name after its \u201cToo Many Balls\u201d marketing campaign launched in October was criticized as transphobic. In a blog post, the team said it has launched a process to \u201cseek out, listen to, and reflect on input about our team name.\u201d",
      "Opponents, who say they want a professional women's team but not in Franklin Park, nevertheless are relishing the latest bout of bad publicity.",
      "\u201cWe are more confident than ever that Franklin Park will be protected from their scheme to turn this historic parkland into a colossal sports and entertainment complex.\u201d Renee Stacy Welsh, a member of the Franklin Park Defenders, which opposes the project, said in a statement."

Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",

The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guidance on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",

And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest.

So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",

      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across Ukraine's military",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The concert took place in an old movie studio in Kyiv, the location kept secret until the final moment in case it was the target of a Russian attack.",
      "More than 1,000 soldiers and young people gathered to listen to the artists who joined forces with a military brigade in an innovative effort to raise funds for Ukraine\u2019s embattled troops.",
      "This was the first and only live performance of the charity album \u201cEpoch,\u201d a collaboration between the 3rd Assault Brigade and eight Ukrainian bands.",
      "The project\u2019s ambitious target is to raise 50 million hryvnias (about $1.2 million) to buy an M113 armored personnel carrier to help get infantry to the front and evacuate the wounded for medical treatment. Since it launched on streaming platforms a month ago, the initiative has raised 9 million hryvnias (around $214,000).",
      "Grassroots fundraising for Ukrainian fighters dates back to 2014, the year Russia first annexed the southern region of Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists launched an uprising in eastern Ukraine. At that time, Ukraine\u2019s defense was made up of a regular army supported by volunteer battalions who weren't financially supported by Kyiv\u2019s government. Self-funding was critical.",
      "Now, advertisements pasted along the sidewalk in Kyiv ask for donations to help fill financial gaps across the military. By scanning a QR code, people can help buy anything from body warmers and drones to armored cars for soldiers defending the nearly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line.",
      "But some charities are seeing a decline in individual donations in part because of the economic situation in the country.",
      "Oleksandr Borodyn, one of the project's organizers, says the idea for the collaboration came from the challenge of continuing to drum up funds to support troops as the war is on the cusp of marking a three-year milestone.",
      "\u201cTo raise the same amount of money as at the beginning of the war, you need much more effort. That\u2019s why we came up with the idea that a musician could donate his or her art, and that art would earn money for the army,\u201d said Borodyn, a press officer for the 3rd Assault Brigade.",
      "The initiative comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before Washington's support for Kyiv\u2019s defenses is thrown into question when Donald Trump takes office next month.",
      "Monobank, one of the largest platforms to process donations, says that in the first 1,000 days of war, nearly 10.5 million unique users made donations totaling around 77 billion hryvnias (about $1.8 billion) to various fundraising organizations.",
      "But some charity groups are finding that voluntary funding isn't what it was in the first year of the full-scale invasion. The Come Back Alive foundation supports troops with anything from military training to buying drones and electronic warfare to repel attacks. In the first year of the conflict, they raised more than 5.7 billion hryvnias ($184 million). So far in 2024, the figure is nearly 3.6 billion hryvnias ($89 million).",
      "\u201cMany people report a worsening financial situation, which limits their ability to contribute to supporting the military,\u201d said Oleh Karpenko, deputy director of the Come Back Alive Foundation.",
      "Three years of war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine\u2019s economy. According to a World Bank report released in May, the number of Ukrainians living in poverty has grown by 1.8 million since 2020 to about 9 million, or 29% of the population.",
      "To help the most vulnerable, the government launched a winter support program at the beginning of December and within days, around 6.5 million people had applied to receive the one off 1,000 hryvnia ($24) payment to help cover utilities, medical services and cellphone costs.",
      "According to Karpenko, local initiatives and smaller-scale fundraising efforts mean many people direct their contributions toward helping specific soldiers or military units they know personally. That reduces the amount received by larger organizations, which he says can promptly address urgent battlefield needs that the government can't meet.",
      "\u201cInternational support also plays a significant role in donation levels,\" Karpenko said. \"When aid from international partners decreases, it strongly demotivates Ukrainian society. People lose motivation to donate when they perceive a lack of willingness from partners to actively supply weapons.\u201d",
      "Staring up at the large monitors set up on either side of the stage in the form of the three diagonal line symbol of the 3rd Assault Brigade, 26-year-old Oksana Kalenchenko thinks that events like the concert are hugely important in continuing to generate support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to somebody that there is a war going on in Ukraine, let\u2019s keep donating, let\u2019s keep doing everything we can,\u201d Kalenchenko said.",
      "The collaboration album features young artists from Ukraine\u2019s rock, rap and alternative scene, and many of the lyrics reflect events and the reality of living through the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe want to show the reflection of contemporary artists to the situation in Ukraine, and in general to Ukraine at war \u2026 That\u2019s why the project is called \u2018Epoch,\u2019 because it is a transmission of the era we are living in,\u201d Borodyn said.",
      "What also unites all the songs is language. Since the start of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukrainian music has experienced somewhat of a revival with many artists shunning the traditional Russian pop scene that dominated the post-Soviet era.",
      "\u201cPeople did not pay attention to Ukrainian music in such a large number,\u201d says Iryna Panchuk, singer and songwriter for \u201cRenie Cares,\u201d one of the bands on the album. \u201cThis is separation, because this is what makes us different from Russia and this needs to be emphasized very strongly \u2014 emphasized and strengthened,\u201d she added.",

      "A yearlong study by Major League Baseball has concluded rising velocities, pitch shaping and emphasis on maximum effort are the likely causes of the vast increase in pitcher injuries and recommended exploring rules changes to address the problem",
      "NEW YORK -- A yearlong study by Major League Baseball concluded rising velocities, pitch shaping and emphasis on maximum effort are the likely causes of the vast increase in pitcher injuries and recommended exploring rules changes to address the problem.",
      "The 62-page report released Tuesday said the trends extended to high school and youth baseball because of the incentive to get noticed by professional scouts. The study said there is no evidence linking the pitch clock to injuries.",
      "Illustrated with 26 tables of data, the report was based on interviews with more than 200 people that included players, front office executives, orthopedic surgeons, athletic trainers, physical therapists, biochemists, major league, college and independent coaches, and international trainers.",
      "\u201cThis is a landmark event,\u201d said Glenn Fleisig, director of biomechanics research at the American Sports Medicine Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, who participated in the study. \"This is a very important first step, which is to identify the problem and identify the likely risk factors. I am pleased that there was such a consensus. ... The next step is to do various types of research studies.\"",
      "Possible areas to be studied include offseason training and early season workload, non-game activity, defining and measuring fatigue, biomechanics and pitching style, obtaining more data from international leagues and differentiating results from domestic and international signings.",
      "Major league pitcher IL placements increased from 212 in 2005 to 485 this year and days on the IL rose from 13,666 to 32,257.",
      "\u201cThe most significant causes are likely the increased velocity of pitches, the emphasis on optimizing \u2018stuff\u2019 (a term referencing the composite movement characteristics of pitches, including horizontal and vertical break and spin rate), and the modern pitcher\u2019s focus on exerting maximum effort while pitching in both game and non-game situations,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cSome experts speculated on the potential influence of other factors on the short-term increase in injuries over the past several years, including the lasting effect of COVID-impacted seasons, the introduction of the pitch clock and perceived inconsistencies in the surface grip of the baseball. There was not sufficient consensus or evidence to establish a link between these other factors and pitcher injuries.\u201d",
      "The report said experts recommend MLB consider rules changes to \u201cincrease the value of pitcher health and durability and decrease the value of short-duration, max-effort pitching.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor instance, playing rules could be adjusted or designed to encourage or require starting pitchers to preserve enough energy to allow them to pitch deeper into games,\u201d the report said. \u201cThese incentives could be supported by roster rules that more appropriately regulate the availability of pitchers on a roster or in a team\u2019s bullpen for a given game, including potential changes to the number and frequency of transactions that allow clubs to replace pitchers on their rosters.\u201d",
      "MLB experimented in the Atlantic League with a double-hook designated hitter from 2021-13, in which a team lost its DH if its starting pitcher didn\u2019t finish at least five innings in the last two seasons. MLB lowered the maximum on pitchers from 14 to 13 on June 20, 2022, though it is 14 from Sept. 1 on after rosters expand from 26 to 28. The minimum pitcher IL was restored to 15 days in 2022 after dropping to 10 for the previous five years.",
      "Factors in injuries may include use of weighted balls in training, increased intensity of bullpen sessions, a possible decline in cardiovascular and endurance training, and workload management that incentivizes harder effort over shorter spans.",
      "\u201cMultiple medical experts described new injury patterns that they believe are tied to the focus on velocity and max-effort pitching,\u201d the report said, listing latissimus and teres major tears, rib fractures and oblique strains.",
      "Among the data points:",
      "1. Tommy John surgeries for major and minor league players increased from 104 in 2010 to a peak of 314 in 2020 and declined to 281 this year.

Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens.\u201d",
      "There have been other All-Star format shakeups in recent years. After the first 66 All-Star Games were basically played like a normal game \u2014 Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference, four quarters, 12 minutes apiece \u2014 the league switched to a format where the leading vote-getters from each conference served as captains who got to draft their teams.",

      "Fans \u2014 who can vote through Jan. 20 \u2014 can cast ballots daily for three frontcourt and two backcourt players from both conferences.",

      "Becky Sauerbrunn, a former captain of the U.S. women\u2019s team who played in three Olympics and three Women\u2019s World Cups, announced her retirement Tuesday from professional soccer after a 16-year international career",
      "CHICAGO -- Becky Sauerbrunn, a former captain of the U.S. women's team who played in three Olympics and three Women\u2019s World Cups, announced her retirement Tuesday from professional soccer after a 16-year international career.",
      "Sauerbrunn, 39, also played in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League for every year it has existed and was a four-time league Defender of the Year. She won two championships with FC Kansas City and another with the Portland Thorns. She also played with the Utah Royals.",
      "\u201cI learned early on that we were all just renting our jerseys,\u201d Sauerbrunn said in a statement. \u201cThat I got to wear the U.S. Soccer crest once was an honor and privilege for which I\u2019m forever grateful. The fact that I got to do it over 200 times is truly humbling. I competed with and learned from some of the greatest players and leaders this sport has ever seen, and I consider myself beyond lucky to have been able to play a small part in this program\u2019s storied history.\u201d",
      "Sauerbrunn became a consistent starter for the national team, starting 167 of her 182 games between 2013 and 2024. She ends her international career with 219 caps, good for 10th all-time in national team history.",
      "She was a key player in the United States' runs to World Cup titles in 2015 in Canada and 2019 in France. She played every minute in Canada and sat out only the first game in France. The US allowed just three goals during each of those tournaments.",
      "Sauerbrunn earned a bronze medal with the team at the Olympics in 2021.",

    "summary": "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is preparing to play against Houston on Saturday",
    "story": [
      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is preparing to play against Houston on Saturday",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes is preparing to play against Houston on Saturday, unless his ailing ankle puts the two-time MVP in such a precarious position that he can't protect himself or he \u201cputs the football team in a bad position.\u201d",
      "Mahomes sustained a mild high-ankle sprain late in a 21-7 win in Cleveland on Sunday. He began to receive treatment on the plane ride home \u2014 \u201cI wasn't do high-knees or anything like that,\u201d he quipped \u2014 and spent more than 12 hours getting additional work on it at the practice facility Monday, even though most of the team was given the day off.",
      "Mahomes was back on the practice field Tuesday with Carson Wentz there to back him up.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to go out there and put yourself in harm's way. It's football. You're going to take hits. But you want to be able to protect yourself,\" Mahomes said. \"And I don't want to limit the game plan. I want to be able to move around the pocket.\u201d",
      "Mahomes has plenty of experience with ankle injuries to draw from. He sustained a similar one against Jacksonville in Week 1 of the 2019 season, then a more serious one against the Jaguars in the 2022 playoffs. In that case, he was unable to end the game but got enough treatment to play against Cincinnati for the AFC title and Philadelphia in the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cJacksonville was worse. That one was pretty significant,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cObviously it's responded better, quicker. That would be the best thing to say. But I want to be in a better spot than I was that next game going up against the Bengals.\u201d",
      "Mahomes has the luxury of time that he didn't have two years ago. The Chiefs already have clinched the AFC West title and a spot in the playoffs, and he could conceivably miss a game or two if it meant being fully healthy for the postseason.",
      "Yet there is much riding on this three-game stretch against Houston on Saturday, the Steelers on Christmas Day and the Broncos the final weekend of the regular season. The Chiefs (13-1) are clinging to a two-game lead over the Bills for the No. 1 seed and the lone playoff bye, but Buffalo holds the tiebreaker over them by virtue of their victory earlier this season.",
      "\u201cEvery game counts,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cIf your guys can play, they play, as long as medically they're fine to go.\u201d",
      "While Mahomes has a reputation for playing through pain, and even arguing with Reid on the sideline to stay in games in which he's been hurt, Reid believes his quarterback will be honest with how his ankle feels throughout the week.",
      "\u201cHe's going to go through some stuff and we'll see how that works out for him. And if he can't work, then Carson will take those reps that Pat doesn't,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe have full confidence in Carson if he has to step in and play. I think everybody \u2014 coaches and players \u2014 have full confidence he can go in and do a nice job.\u201d",
      "Wentz, who signed a $3.325 million contract with Kansas City to replace Blaine Gabbert as Mahomes\u2019 backup, has appeared in nearly 100 games during his NFL career. He completed both of his pass attempts for 20 yards in the closing minutes against the Browns, allowing the Chiefs to run out the clock on their victory.",
      "\u201cGot my feet wet a little bit at the end of last game and felt good out there,\u201d Wentz said. \u201cNothing is going to change this week. Patrick has had some nicks and bruises all year and I've prepared myself the same way.\u201d",
      "NOTES: DB Chamarri Conner (concussion) and LT D.J. Humphries (hamstring) did not practice Tuesday. ... WR Marquise Brown (shoulder surgery) could make his regular-season debut against Houston after looking good in practice last week. \u201cThe doctors say it's healed up nice. We'll just see,\u201d Reid said. ... CB Steven Nelson is less likely than Brown to play this week, Reid said. He came out of retirement by signing with the Kansas City practice squad last week.",

    "story": [
      "The PWHL\u2019s highly touted rookie draft class is already making a significant impact two weeks into the season",
      "Sceptres defenseman Renata Fast recalled attending the PWHL draft in June and being impressed by how much young talent Toronto was adding to its roster before quickly coming to another more worrisome realization.",
      "The league\u2019s other five teams got better, too.",
      "Fast shared her recollection when assessing the impact the PWHL\u2019s highly touted rookie class has already made two weeks into the league's second season.",
      "\u201cThe level of play is elevated. Credit a lot of that to the rookie class that\u2019s coming in. They\u2019ve been amazing,\" Fast said. \"It\u2019s making the league that much deeper.\u201d",
      "With play resuming Tuesday following a nine-day international break, New York Sirens rookie and No. 1 draft pick Sarah Fillier leads the league with six points (two goals, four assists). Minnesota Frost rookie Dominique Petrie\u2019s three goals are tied for the lead.",
      "Though the sample size is small, with each team playing three games, the expectations were large for a group of so-called rookies, who brought with them years of international experience as well as a small wave of Europeans making the jump from the Swedish women\u2019s pro league.",
      "Overall, 29 of the 42 players drafted have made their teams\u2019 23-player rosters, representing a 21% turnover from the PWHL\u2019s inaugural season. The high rate of change reflects how talented the rookie class is \u2014 the first 10 players selected had national team experience \u2014 and how the PWHL is already considering expansion by as many as two teams by next year to account for growing global talent pool.",
      "With expansion looming, Sceptres coach Troy Ryan expects this season to be one of the PWHL\u2019s most competitive because of the concentration of talent spread among just six teams.",
      "\u201cI thought the league was great last year. I thought it was a good caliber of hockey,\u201d said Ryan, who also is Canada\u2019s national team coach. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody could question that the league, though this past draft, has taken a substantial leap forward in the talent and depth of the talent that we\u2019re able to put on the ice.\u201d",
      "Ken Klee, coach of the defending champion Frost, put it this way by noting Minnesota essentially traded its bottom two forwards and sixth defenseman from last season in drafting top-six forwards in Petrie and Britta Curl-Salemme, and blue-liner Claire Thompson.",
      "What helps, too, Klee said, is rookies joining teams with established cultures and cores, unlike last season when everything from the travel schedule, checking and playing games in NHL-sized arenas was relatively new to everyone",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of unknowns last year for every single player, it didn\u2019t matter if was Kendall Coyne (Schofield) or Taylor Heise or anyone else,\u201d Klee said. \u201cI think having the chemistry of last year for every team allows a rookie to come in this year and say, \u2018Okay, how do I fit in?\u2019\u201d",
      "Petrie, a fifth-round pick, credited her teammates and coaches in helping her make the jump. From California, she spent three seasons at Harvard before missing a year after breaking her leg and tearing a knee ligament, and closed her college career at Clarkson.",
      "Not a surprise is Fillier\u2019s easy transition following five celebrated seasons at Princeton and a gold-medal win representing Canada at the 2022 Olympics. It helps, too, playing alongside U.S. national team veteran Alex Carpenter, who finished tied for second in the PWHL last season with 23 points (eight goals, 15 assists).",
      "\u201cThose are two great players,\u201d Boston Fleet forward Hilary Knight said. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re finding success together is great for them, not so great for the rest of us.\u201d",
      "The 24-year-old Fillier expected this from herself and her fellow rookies.",
      "\u201cOur draft class was super deep. I mean, teams were picking up really quality players even in the last rounds of the draft who are making an impact right away on their teams,\u201d Fillier said.",
      "The added talent left Klee anticipating an uptick in scoring after teams averaged 2.4 goals per outing last year. Boston goalie Aerin Frankel said her job has been tougher three games into this season, though she\u2019s held her own so far in ranking third with a 2.02 goals-against average and second with a .937 save percentage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just no nights off. ... Every team is pretty stacked with goal-scoring ability,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s been fun. It adds a challenge to the game playing against some of these young players with so much skill.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Rafael Nadal thought about taking a mental health break from tennis a few years ago but \u201cconquered it by always moving forward\u201d and \u201cslowly became myself again,\u201d the 22-time Grand Slam champion writes in an essay posted online Tuesday, less than a month after the last match of his career.",
      "\u201cPhysical pain I was very used to, but there were times on the court when I had trouble controlling my breathing, and I couldn\u2019t play at the highest level. I don\u2019t have trouble saying it now. After all, we are human beings, not superheroes,\u201d Nadal says on The Player's Tribune.",
      "\u201cThankfully, I didn\u2019t get to the point of not being able to control things like anxiety, but there are moments with every player when it\u2019s difficult to control your mind, and when that happens it\u2019s difficult to have total control of your game,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were months when I thought about taking a complete break from tennis to cleanse my mind. In the end, I worked on it every day to get better.\u201d",
      "The 38-year-old Nadal headed into retirement after playing for Spain in the Davis Cup in November, following two seasons filled with injury issues that limited him to competing only sparingly.",
      "In the essay, he writes about the chronic pain in his left foot that first surfaced when he was 17 and says he was told then that he \u201cwould probably never play professional tennis again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI spent many days at home crying, but it was a great lesson in humility, and I was lucky to have a father \u2014 the real influence I\u2019ve had in my life \u2014 who was always so positive,\u201d said Nadal, who won a record 14 championships at the French Open.",
      "He mentions being nervous before matches, and some of the highlights of his career, and notes: \u201cI hope that my legacy is that I always tried to treat others with deep respect. This was the golden rule of my parents.\u201d",

      "\u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d Monahan said in a video message posted on PGA Tour's social media channels.",
      "The PGA Tour is wrapping up a year of sweeping changes while still unable to reach an agreement with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, though recent signs indicate they are closer than ever. Still unknown is to what degree this can unite a sport where its biggest names are competing in opposite leagues.",
      "Strategic Sports Group, a consortium of American sports business owners led by Fenway Sports Group, invested $1.5 billion in a deal announced in late January, with the possibility of that investment reaching $3 billion.",

      "Professional golf now has four top executive openings. The LPGA is searching for a new commissioner to replace Mollie Marcoux Samaan; the PGA of America has narrowed its search for a CEO to replace Seth Waugh; and LIV Golf is expected to name Scott O'Neil as its new CEO with Greg Norman taking on a different role.",

      "The tour also will be launching its massive PGA Tour Studios next to its headquarters, filled with the latest technology that will allow the tour to produce its own content and \u201cdelivering our fans around the world more of what you want to see,\u201d Monahan said.",
      "The tour also has invested in the TMRW Golf League that starts next month, an indoor competition among six teams that will be televised on ESPN platforms. Woods and Rory McIlroy are behind TGL and belong to the teams filled with top players.",
      "Monahan's message came on the day McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler play an exhibition match against Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka from LIV Golf, a sign interpreted as a small step toward getting PGA Tour and LIV Golf players together more often than the four majors.",
      "But there has been no indication of any serious competition among the two leagues. LIV still hasn't filled out its 2025 schedule \u2014 its fourth season.",

      "Curt Cignetti of Indiana has been named The Associated Press Coach of the Year in college football",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- When Curt Cignetti took the Indiana job last fall, he promised immediate success.",
      "It wasn't boastful bluster.",
      "After daring the doubters to Google his winning pedigree, the son of a Hall of Fame football coach delivered on his word by leading the Hoosiers to a school-record 11 wins, a top 10 ranking and an improbable first playoff berth that set up a Friday night game at No. 3 Notre Dame.",
      "Cignetti was named The Associated Press Coach of the Year on Tuesday, collecting 30 of 45 votes from AP Top 25 voters. Arizona State coach Kenny Dillingham finished second with eight votes, Oregon coach Dan Lanning received five and SMU coach Rhett Lashlee got two.",
      "\u201cThank you to The Associated Press for this tremendous team honor,\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cOur program has had a great season and we look forward to opening the College Football Playoff against Notre Dame on Friday.\u201d",
      "Few thought such a season was possible at Indiana, much less in his first season. Cignetti authored an eight-win turnaround that captivated the nation at a school with the most losses in Football Bowl Subdivision history.",
      "Then again, all the 60-year-old Cignetti does is win.",
      "He's never had a losing record in 14 seasons as a head coach and has a reputation for making quick turnarounds everywhere he goes \u2014 Alabama, where he served as Nick Saban's first recruiting coordinator and won a national title, following his father to Indiana University of Pennsylvania or at FCS school Elon and James Madison, where he presided over the most successful transition from the FCS to FBS in NCAA history.",
      "Cignetti won conference coach of the year awards at IUP, Elon, James Madison and now in the Big Ten with Indiana. Cignetti brought most of his coaching staff and 13 players from the Dukes to Indiana and the results were as surprising as they were at any of his previous stops.",
      "Even Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman took note.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about him, so I took a minute and Googled him and looked at some of the things he\u2019s done in the past at his other places,\u201d Freeman said Sunday, a week after the playoff pairings were announced. \u201cHe\u2019s won everywhere he\u2019s been. He\u2019s done a great job.\u201d",
      "The winner of seventh-seeded Notre Dame (11-1) and 10th-seeded Indiana advances to the quarterfinal round against second-seeded Georgia (11-2, No. 2 AP).",
      "Cignetti is the first Indiana coach to win the award since its inception in 1998. His predecessor, Tom Allen, finished second in 2020 after leading the Hoosiers to a 6-2 mark, a second straight January bowl game and a final ranking of No. 12.",
      "But this has been a historic season for the Hoosiers (11-1) and Cignetti. who became the first Indiana coach to start 10-0 \u2014 or even post double-digit wins in season.",
      "Indiana produced its largest margin of victory in school history, 77-3 over Western Illinois, in September and two of its three largest victory margins in Big Ten play, 56-7 over Nebraska in October and 66-0 over rival Purdue in its regular-season finale.",
      "Ten of the 11 wins were by margins of 14 or more points and they only trailed in the second half of one game, a loss at then-No. 2 Ohio State. And Indiana isn't just the highest scoring team in the playoffs at 43.3 points per game, it also has the No. 6 scoring defense (14.67 points) and the No. 1 run defense (70.8 yards per game) in the FBS.",
      "It's not a surprise to anyone in the program, least of all Cignetti.",
      "\u201cThis team\u2019s accomplished a lot, I\u2019m proud of what they\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cI think the coaches have done a great job, players have done a great job. But in saying that, no one\u2019s satisfied. The players are hungry for more, the coaches are hungry for more.\u201d",

      "Dave Clawson choked back tears multiple times as he explained why it was the right time for him to step down as Wake Forest\u2019s coach amid a time of landscape-altering changes in college athletics",
      "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Emotions bubbled up repeatedly for Dave Clawson, leaving him choking back tears as he explained why it was the right time for him to step down as Wake Forest's coach. They came as he talked about his players, his coaching staff, the high points of a successful 11-year run here and the ever-present demands on his family.",
      "And yet, there was at least one thing Clawson wouldn't miss: running a program amid a time of landscape-altering changes in college athletics.",
      "\u201cYou can't do something successfully, and it's not fair to the players or the institution if you're doing something that your whole heart and soul isn't into,\u201d Clawson said at a news conference a day after the school announced his resignation.",
      "\u201cI did not want to do this, in my perfect world I'd be having this press conference in three or four years. But I just looked at kind of where the industry is right now, and I just felt like it was time.\u201d",
      "And so, the 57-year-old Clawson took a similar route as another Atlantic Coast Conference coach of similar age \u2014 Virginia's Tony Bennett in men's basketball \u2014 in stepping away from the sport years before a projected retirement window.",
      "It was roughly two months earlier that the 55-year-old Bennett, who won a national championship with the Cavaliers in 2019, declared himself \u201ca square peg in a round hole\u201d in a tearful farewell. That came amid a time of free player movement through the transfer portal and players being able to cash in on their athletic fame through name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities \u2014 a combination that has led to roster upheaval across college sports.",
      "It's no coincidence that there were some familiar vibes in Clawson's message Tuesday.",
      "Asked about the parallel to Bennett's exit, Clawson recalled a \u201cvery frank discussion\" he had with the former Virginia coach outside an elevator last year during league meetings as they reflected on a \u201cmore transactional\u201d time in college coaching.",
      "\u201cI think players getting paid and compensated, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cJust the system, that every single player on your team is a free agent. And we\u2019ve probably had four or five players leave Wake Forest in the past two years that were one semester away from graduating because another school gave them another $25,000 or $50,000. And that breaks my heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat isn't the reason I got into this,\u201d Clawson added. \u201cSo a lot of the things Tony said certainly resonated with me.\u201d",
      "By Tuesday, Clawson said he felt as if it was \u201csomebody else\u2019s job\u201d as he shifts into an advisory role to athletic director John Currie.",
      "\u201cI tried to embrace it, I tried to fight through it,\u201d Clawson said. \u201cI tried to get in the mindset with it. I could do it, I just don\u2019t want to do it. It\u2019s really where I am. It\u2019s not the way I\u2019m wired. It\u2019s not how I build programs. It\u2019s not why I got into coaching.\u201d",
      "Clawson's tenure included guiding Wake Forest to 11 wins and a trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in 2021, as well as cracking the top 10 of the AP poll in 2021 and 2022 amid a run of six straight bowl appearances.",
      "But the Demon Deacons had gone just 4-8 in the past two seasons as the formula that had helped them sustain success became trickier to manage in today\u2019s era. The school boasts one of the smallest undergraduate enrollments in the Bowl Subdivision ranks (5,471 as of 2023-24), and the program had thrived under Clawson by retaining and developing players over years rather than landing four- and five-star recruits.",
      "It all came together  in 2021, an 11-win season that included Clawson reaching a long-term contract extension with the school on the eve of the ACC division-clinching win at Boston College.",
      "\u201cThere'a lots of moments to celebrate in life and sometimes those moments of celebration are bittersweet,\u201d said Currie, who also choked up multiple times during the news conference.",
      "In some ways, Clawson sounded ready to move forward. He said he had briefly mulled stepping away after last season and now was eager to be \"a better husband, a better father, hopefully a better friend\u201d now removed from a job with 16-hour workdays.",
      "Yet he also admitted it was \u201ca little scary\u201d not being a coach for the first time in decades. That was why, beyond saying he wouldn't coach next season, he offered no certainties about his future. Instead, he quipped that his new advisory role offered the allure that he wouldn't have to wear ties, and he doubled down by wearing a gray suit and a tie-less open-collar look for his news conference.",
      "\u201cI'm not going to be here every day,\u201d Clawson said he told Currie. \"I want this to be high-impact, low volume.",
      "\u201cI really hope I can find something outside of coaching that I find fulfilling, meaningful, purposeful. I hope that's the case. But I'm a coach, I've done this for 36 years and there's so many parts about the job that I love. But I need some time away to kind of refresh and refocus, and figure out what's next.\u201d",

      "Left-hander Max Fried and the New York Yankees have finalized a $218 million, eight-year contract",
      "NEW YORK -- Left-hander Max Fried and the New York Yankees finalized a $218 million, eight-year contract on Tuesday.",
      "The deal was agreed to last week at the winter meetings after the Yankees lost outfielder Juan Soto to the rival Mets.",
      "Fried\u2019s deal is the largest for a left-handed pitcher in baseball history, $1 million more than David Price\u2019s seven-year contract with the Boston Red Sox ahead of the 2016 season.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the game\u2019s really, really good pitchers and has a really good track record now of success,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said last week. \u201cHe\u2019s a special talent.\u201d",
      "Fried gets a $20 million signing bonus, half payable on Jan. 31, 2025, and the rest on Jan. 31, 2026. He gets salaries of $12 million in each of the first two seasons and $29 million in each of the remaining six.",
      "Yankees fans were angry after Soto accepted the Mets\u2019 $765 million, 15-year offer over the Yankees\u2019 $760 million, 16-year proposal. The Yankees then redirected money to starting pitching, though Fried represents some risk: The two-time All-Star has been on the injured list 10 times since 2018, including at least once each season.",
      "A high school teammate of Jack Flaherty and Lucas Giolito at Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles, Fried gets the fourth-highest contract among pitchers behind the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Yoshinobu Yamamoto ($325 million for 12 years through 2035), the Yankees\u2019 Gerrit Cole ($324 million for nine years through 2028) and Washington\u2019s Stephen Strasburg ($245 million for seven years through 2026). Strasburg hasn\u2019t pitched since 2022 and has retired.",
      "Yankees staff met with Fried on a Zoom session during the negotiations.",
      "\u201cObviously watching him from afar over the last several years you know this is a guy you can tell really competes well on the mound and that came across in our meeting with him,\u201d Boone said.",
      "After spending his first eight seasons with the Atlanta Braves, Fried joins a list of rotation possibilities that also includes Cole, Carlos Rod\u00f3n, Luis Gil, Clarke Schmidt and Marcus Stroman.",
      "Fried was 54-25 with a 2.81 ERA with five complete games and four shutouts in 112 starts over the past five seasons. He was among only three pitchers to throw two complete games this year, when there were just 16 in the major leagues.",
      "A three-time Gold Glove winner who turns 31 on Jan. 18, Fried has one of the broadest repertoires in the major leagues, throwing seven different pitches. He averaged 93.9 mph this year with his fastball, which he threw 33.6% of the time. Fried mixed in 21% curveballs, 15.6% sinkers, 13.6% changeups, 5.9% sweepers, 5.6% sliders and 4.7% cutters.",
      "He was 11-10 with a 3.25 ERA over 29 starts this year, striking out 166 and walking a career-high 57 in 174 1/3 innings. Fried missed time for left forearm neuritis, his seventh straight season on the IL.",
      "He had prior IL stints for a blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand and strained left groin (2018), blister on left index finger (2019), muscle spasm on left side of back (2020), strained right hamstring (2021), concussion (2022) and strained left hamstring, strained left forearm and blister on left index finger (2023).",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s inherent risks,\u201d Boone said, \u201cbut we feel like he\u2019s a really good pitcher and the way he goes about it, prepares, trains, we feel like he\u2019s doing everything he can to be a guy that\u2019s able to consistently go to the post.\u201d",
      "Fried was the seventh overall pick in the 2012 amateur draft by the San Diego Padres. He had Tommy John surgery in August 2014 and was traded to the Atlanta Braves in December 2014 as part of a six-player deal that sent outfielder Justin Upton to the Padres.",
      "He made his major league debut in August 2017 and was optioned to the minors five times in 2018.",
      "Fried was 17-6 with a 4.02 ERA in 2019 and 7-0 with a 2.25 ERA in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, finishing fifth in the National League Cy Young Award voting.",
      "He went 14-7 with a 3.04 ERA in 2021, when he pitched six scoreless innings to beat Houston in the World Series Game 6 clincher and was 14-7 with a 2.48 ERA in 2022, when he made his first All-Star team. Fried was 8-1 with a 2.55 ERA over 14 starts in 2023.",

      "\u201cI have agreed,\u201d McGregor said.",
      "McGregor also said that rumors of a potential bout with Ultimate Fighting Championship featherweight champion Ilia Topuria were false. McGregor said he would make his \u201creturn to the Octagon\u201d after his boxing exhibition with Paul.",

      "Nikita Hand said the assault left her heavily bruised and suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. McGregor testified that he never forced the woman to do anything against her will and said she fabricated the allegations after the two had consensual sex.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name alleged victims of sexual violence unless they come forward publicly, as Hand has done.",
      "The 36-year-old McGregor was once the biggest UFC star, but he hasn\u2019t fought since injuring his leg during a bout with Dustin Poirier in July 2021. He pulled out of a scheduled UFC 303 match with Michael Chandler last June and said later that it was due to a broken toe.",
      "Paul is a YouTuber-turned-boxer. He previously fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in an exhibition, among others. His brother Jake Paul won a unanimous decision over 58-year-old former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson last month in Arlington, Texas. The Jake Paul-Tyson fight was the first live sports event on Netflix, which announced that the bout was viewed in 60 million households.",

      "HOOFDDORP, Netherlands -- Some elite-level women's soccer players are dealing with a packed schedule even as others don't have enough games to play, global players' union FIFPRO said Tuesday.",
      "FIFPRO's study highlighted a disproportionately heavy workload for a few players like Mariona Caldentey, who played 64 times for Barcelona and Spain last season as Barcelona played four different competitions and won them all. Caldentey now plays for Arsenal in England.",
      "However, FIFPRO also pointed out that many players had barely half that number of games \u2014 just 33 games per season was the average per player.",
      "FIFPRO said its study showed the impact of \u201cnew or expanded competitions in a few countries, notably in Europe and North America, and little or no development elsewhere.\u201d More top-level competitions like a women's Club World Cup are in development.",

      "As if the American team wasn't under enough pressure to win back the Ryder Cup, now they are painted as being greedy for getting paid to play",
      "Bringing the Ryder Cup to notoriously nasty Bethpage Black already was cause for concern. Imagine the most passionate, patriotic event in golf played before a flag-waving crowd that once harassed Sergio Garcia so badly he pointed at them with the wrong finger.",
      "This could make the 1999 matches outside Boston look like a real tea party.",
      "And now add money to the equation and the Americans will be under more pressure than ever to deliver that 17-inch gold trophy the home crowd expects to win in September.",
      "The PGA of America took a step toward quashing the quibbling about whether players should be paid. It decided on a new compensation package that keeps charity at the forefront ($300,000) and gives players and the captain $200,000 to let them decide if it should go in their wallets or to a good cause.",
      "U.S. captain Keegan Bradley, in a show of leadership far more valuable than team uniforms, declared all his $500,000 is going to charity.",
      "Does the money make a difference? Not really.",
      "The total compensation \u2014 charity and the stipend \u2014 is roughly the equivalent of what 10th place paid at the PGA Championship this year. Does anyone really believe the level of motivation on the biggest stage depends on the purse?",
      "Tiger Woods is the richest man in golf and always played like he didn't have two nickels to rub together. Woods loves his money, but that's not what drives him. And anyone good enough to make the U.S. team most likely has that much in common with him.",
      "Start at the top.",
      "\u201cI've been playing golf my whole life for free and the money's just a bonus,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said two weeks ago in the Bahamas. \u201cI want to win just as bad for zero dollars as I do for whatever millions of dollars it is.\u201d",
      "That would be $62,228,357 for those keeping track. Now the world's No. 1 player gets an additional $200,000. That probably won't motivate Scheffler more than the 9-and-7 loss he and Brooks Koepka suffered last time at Marco Simone.",
      "Players \u2014 not just Americans \u2014 for a decade have been raising questions about the sharp rise in revenue at majors and the incremental increase in prize money. But money is the last thing on their minds standing over a 6-foot putt to square the match in the Ryder Cup.",
      "This was always about economics.",
      "It surfaced in 1999 going into matches at The Country Club. The Ryder Cup had become big business by then. The PGA of America was raking in millions (net profit estimated at $23 million that year) and players \u2014 the show ponies \u2014 were getting a $5,000 stipend.",
      "\u201cWhen you can\u2019t show up and play for your country, if playing for your country is not enough, my heart bleeds for the game of golf,\" U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said. This was after he had cashed in on a new golf ball endorsement and clothing deal as Ryder Cup captain. Big business.",
      "Players wanted more say in how some of the proceeds were spent, and the PGA of America responded by setting aside $200,000 to be split between their college golf programs and their designated charities.",
      "Why is this an issue in America? It's a difference in funding. The PGA of America uses PGA Tour players to make a mint (and pay for many of the association's noble projects). Income from the Ryder Cup in Europe supports the players' very tour.",
      "Either way, money has been at the core of the Ryder Cup for some time. But now it's official, and it's a bad look for the Americans.",
      "For the first time in this century-old competition, they get a check for their services. Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer never got paid. Neither did Ben Hogan or Byron Nelson.",
      "But this is where golf is right now. Everyone is sick of talking about money, but then most questions directed to players is about money. It's inescapable, even at the Ryder Cup.",
      "\u201cI'm tired of it. The whole world is,\u201d said Seth Waugh, the previous CEO of the PGA of America, going into the Marco Simone matches in 2023. \u201cWe play for love and they play for money. The one time of the year they should be playing for love, we're still talking about money.\u201d",
      "And they'll be talking about it at Bethpage.",
      "It's not enough that the Europeans have won eight of the last 11 times in the Ryder Cup and are better at this competition. They still look for an edge.",
      "One year during the peak of their dominance they rallied around the PGA Tour asking its players to promote the Nationwide Tour (now the Korn Ferry Tour) by referring to it as the second-best tour in golf. After Europe won handily in Ireland, Garcia said, \u201cHopefully we won't get asked if the Nationwide Tour is the second-best tour in the world anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cBehind Europe,\u201d Luke Donald added, the ultimate Ryder Cup rim shot.",
      "Now the U.S. team has given Europeans a rallying cry they didn't really need. They will proudly say they play for passion and their flag (and Seve Ballesteros, of course), that they would gladly pay for the right to play in the Ryder Cup.",
      "European spirit against American greed. Yes, the Bethpage crowd will be watching.",
      "The only way the Americans can escape this bad look is to win. That's how it was when this mess first unfolded. Consider the words of Davis Love III going into Brookline in 1999.",
      "\u201cIf we lose this year after the Presidents Cup (loss in Australia) and losing the last two Ryder Cups \u2014 and after all that controversy over money \u2014 well, it\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we can\u2019t lose. We just can\u2019t lose.\u201d",

      "MANCHESTER, England -- Organizers of a breakaway European Super League have revealed new plans to create a rival to the Champions League.",
      "The Unify League is the latest incarnation of a proposed elite competition for the biggest soccer clubs in Europe. It comes after the launch of a Super League in 2021 collapsed when clubs backed out in the face of angry fan protests.",
      "Madrid-based A22-Sports Management said Tuesday it has submitted proposals to governing bodies UEFA and FIFA for official recognition of its proposed competition.",
      "\u201cNow is the time for all stakeholders, including UEFA and FIFA, to bring real innovation that prioritizes fan experience and affordability, player welfare and match competitiveness,\u201d said A22 chief executive Bernd Reichart.",
      "The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled last year that UEFA and FIFA acted contrary to EU competition law by blocking plans for a Super League.",
      "That decision was celebrated at the time by Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez, who said a \u201cEurope of freedoms has triumphed.\u201d",
      "Madrid has been one of the main supporters of a breakaway league, along with Barcelona \u2014 but the rest of the proposal's original backers pulled out.",
      "Perez, who is in Doha, Qatar, for the Intercontinental Cup final on Wednesday, had not commented publicly on the new proposals.",
      "In 2021 a group of 12 of Europe\u2019s most storied clubs announced plans to create a new league that would have effectively replaced the Champions League \u2014 Europe\u2019s elite club tournament. The controversial plans, which were met with fury from fans and politicians, would have seen 15 top clubs protected from relegation and provided guaranteed entry of teams regardless of their success in national competitions.",
      "A22 launched a revised format last year with promotion, relegation and exit from the competition \u2014 as well as a women's tournament.",
      "The latest plans would include 96 clubs with qualification \u201cbased on annual performance in domestic leagues,\u201d the company said.",
      "A key part of the new format, which would include four leagues for men and two for women, would be free streaming of games to \u201cdirectly connect clubs to their global fan bases,\u201d according to A22.",
      "While A22 said its plans had come after discussions with clubs, leagues and \u201cother parties,\u201d it is not clear which teams would back a rival to the Champions League.",
      "Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan were part of the original breakaway group.",
      "Madrid and Barcelona are the only members of that group not to have publicly distanced themselves from a breakaway.",
      "A22 describes itself as an advisory firm, which has focused on \u201ccreating and organizing new pan-European club football competitions\u201d.",
      "Reichart was previously a broadcasting executive and was CEO of companies such as RTL Deutschland and VOX.",
      "A22 co-founder Anas Laghrari has a background in finance and is described as having led \u201cfinancing initiatives for the renovations of iconic stadiums\u201d as well as advising on sponsorships in sport.",
      "Co-founder John Hahn has overseen investment in telecommunications, media and technology, according to A22's website.",
      "UEFA, FIFA and the European Club Association did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the proposals.",

      "Record numbers of basketball fans filled arenas to watch the rookie seasons of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese unfold",
      "Record numbers of basketball fans filled arenas to watch the rookie seasons of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese unfold. Simone Biles captivated the world at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Coco Gauff made women's tennis history.",
      "It was all part of a pivotal year for women in sports, financially and culturally, and after a steady rise in popularity and reach in recent years, the women's game is more valuable than ever.",
      "\u201c(Clark)'s just moved the needle of the global movement of women in sports,\u201d said softball great and Olympic gold medalist Jennie Finch, \u201cand what a thrill it\u2019s been to be able to see her rise.\u201d",
      "The consulting firm Deloitte estimated in November 2023 that women's sports would generate more than $1 billion in global revenue this year for the first time ever, which the company said is up about 300% from its last estimate in 2021. Skyrocketing viewership and corporate sponsorships were major factors.",
      "The WNBA in July signed a historic 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon Prime and NBC valued at about $200 million \u2014 a jump from about $60 million currently. Players hope higher salaries and a greater share of revenue could be on the horizon as parity, star power and competition in the WNBA continue to grow.",
      "The WNBA had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and best attendance in 22 seasons, and commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a recent state-of-the-league address that players are getting a lot more marketing deals, turning them into household names. That includes Las Vegas star A\u2019ja Wilson, who had one of the most dominant seasons in WNBA history, and Clark, who set numerous rookie records.",
      "The decisive Game 5 of the WNBA finals between the New York Liberty and the Minnesota Lynx drew an average of 2.2 million viewers, peaking at 3.3 million, which made it the most-watched WNBA game in 25 years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing in popularity, endorsements, media rights, all of those things,\u201d said Amira Rose Davis, a sports historian and assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cThis period is one of rapid acceleration,\u201d Davis continued, \"where all that growth seems to switch into overdrive, where the deals are getting bigger, where the visibility is stretching out.\u201d",
      "Clark, the sharp-shooting Indiana guard became a phenomenon when she played at Iowa, capitalized on a foundation laid by hoops stars such as Diana Taurasi, Candace Parker and Wilson, and turbocharged the visibility of women's basketball.",
      "Ticket sales to Indiana Fever games were up 182% in 2024 from the previous season. The Fever also shattered the attendance record of 13,398 set by the Liberty in 1998 with around 16,084 tickets sold per game. And games featuring Clark and her on-court rival Reese of the Chicago Sky prompted social media debates about basketball, race and culture.",
      "\u201cSomething that I always tried to do with me was rise and elevate the game,\u201d said Finch, now an adviser for the Athletes Unlimited Softball League. \"And that\u2019s what (Clark)'s doing and her teammates. And just to be able to watch her do it and how humbly she does it, and the impact of not only domestic women\u2019s basketball, but women\u2019s athletics globally. It\u2019s a dream.\u201d",
      "While many point to the WNBA as a blueprint for success in women's sports, accomplishments in 2024 went far beyond one league or athlete.",
      "Gauff, the 20-year-old tennis superstar, was the world's highest-paid female athlete this year with $30.4 million in earnings, according to Sportico rankings. Gauff could not defend her 2023 U.S. Open title, but ended her 2024 season with a WTA finals title and a $4.8 million check \u2014 the biggest payout ever for a women's tennis event, per Sportico.",
      "The Olympics neared complete gender parity for the first time among the more than 11,000 men and women who competed in Paris this summer.",
      "More than 34 million people across all NBC platforms in the U.S. watched Biles exorcise the demons of her surprising exit from the Tokyo games three years earlier. The 27-year-old shared a message of resilience and redemption as she added four gold medals to her resume. Nearly everything she did in Paris made headlines \u2014 a clap back at social media trolls, a revelation about her mental health, a moment of triumph. Her TikTok showing Team USA\u2019s gold medals from team competition has more than 139 million views.",
      "\u201cShe became a symbol,\u201d Davis said. \"Whether you wanted to symbolize her as persevering, or talking about mental health or refusal, the politics of refusal. Or (whether) you wanted to symbolize her as being a quitter \u2014 being everything that you\u2019re bemoaning about the country. Either way, both projections elevated her even more.\u201d",
      "And as Gauff and Biles soared, other women\u2019s leagues leveraged that visibility.",
      "The Pro Women's Hockey League brought in 392,259 fans during its inaugural regular season, highlighted by a women\u2019s hockey record crowd of 21,105 at the home arena of the NHL's Canadiens for a Montreal-Toronto matchup. The league also reached sponsorship deals with Scotiabank, Air Canada and Hyundai.",
      "The PWHL's strong first season showed its organizers and players that there's an appetite for women's sports, so much so that there are hopes to expand from six to eight teams in 2025.",
      "\u201cFor many of us that have been in the game for so long, it\u2019s emotional to think about where the game's come from, where we\u2019ve come to,\u201d said Jayna Hefford, the league\u2019s senior vice president of hockey operations. \u201cWe spend a lot of time reading research and all these things that suggest the time is now and that the fandom is there. And to be able to live that and feel it in real time was pretty special.\u201d",
      "Keith Stein and Justine Siegal want to capitalize on the women's sports landscape too.",
      "Siegal, a former baseball player and coach, partnered with Stein, a lawyer and businessman, to create the Women's Pro Baseball League, which last month announced plans to launch in 2026 as a six-team circuit for female players. It will be the first pro league for women since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League dissolved in 1954.",
      "\u201cLeagues like the WNBA and (National) Women\u2019s Soccer League have done a lot of the heavy lifting,\" Stein said, \"and they\u2019re part responsible for the moment we\u2019re having right now where women\u2019s sport is a phenomenon.",
      "\"I think there\u2019s, in some ways, a lot more momentum behind the development of professional women\u2019s sports leagues than for men\u2019s.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 13:38:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Boston is planning to renovate a crumbling stadium in one of the city's most diverse neighborhoods for its new professional women's soccer team",
    "story": [
      "Boston is planning to renovate a crumbling stadium in one of the city's most diverse neighborhoods for its new professional women's soccer team",
      "BOSTON -- As the quarterback for the storied Boston Latin Academy, Jack Shapiro has long relished playing some of his high school games at historic White Stadium.",
      "But this season, the closest Shapiro will get to the 75-year-old stadium is a grassy practice field in the shadows of the 10,000-seat facility. The stadium gates are padlocked most days in anticipation of the dilapidated stadium being renovated. In its place will be a glistening, $200 million sports facility for Boston's new professional women's soccer team, BOS Nation FC, starting in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all a little disappointed not to have our home this year,\u201d said Shapiro, quarterback and safety for the high school team which was forced to play its home games in West Roxbury, a 45-minute bus ride from school. The city\u2019s school system will have access to the new facility, but Boston Latin and another school will play elsewhere.",
      "The team said it is still hopeful of playing some games at the new stadium but that remains far from certain.",
      "The city has said that Latin and another high school team, which rely on White Stadium for home games, will have to play elsewhere due to potential damage to the playing surface from cleats. But they have promised that all city schools could play end-of-season games, including championship games, there.",
      "\u201cThe biggest worry is that we will be blocked out,\u201d the team's coach, Rocco Zizza, said as he stood outside the stadium. \u201cIn many ways, what is behind us will not only be a monument for high school football but also maybe a tombstone.\u201d",
      "Shapiro and his team are part of the growing opposition to the joint venture that includes preservationists, environmentalists and neighborhood activists.",
      "Many opponents fear the public would lose access to the stadium, and the critical green space where it sits, if the city teams up with a corporate entity. Supporters argue their plan is the best hope to bringing women's professional soccer to Boston and providing new equipment and facilities for the city's cash-strapped school system.",
      "Surrounded by some of the most diverse and impoverished neighborhoods, White Stadium has long been a refuge for residents to take morning walks, play high school sports, see concerts, attend rallies or send their children to summer camps. The nearly 530-acre (214.48-hectare) Franklin Park, which is also home to the Franklin Park Zoo, is part of the Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s Emerald Necklace system of parks in the city.",
      "Louis Elisa, who lives across the street from the park and is party to the lawsuit attempting to halt the project, said the project will cause \u201cenormous harm to the environment and the community.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit argues the process to approve the project was rushed without adequate community input and violates the state constitution by transferring public land for a private use. Opponents also argue the thousands of fans attending BOS Nation FC games would overwhelm the park and cause widespread traffic and noise problems to nearby neighborhoods.",
      "Instead, they are pushing for repairing the stadium for students at a cost of less than $20 million.",
      "\u201cThe changes that they want to make is going to destroy the antiquities of the park, going to change the character of the park,\u201d said Elisa, president of the Garrison-Trotter Neighborhood Association.",
      "Supporters, led by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, argue the partnership is the only way to fund much-needed renovations and would bring positive change to the neighborhood and the students who rely on facility. Repeated efforts in recent decades to repair the stadium have faltered over a lack of funds, design concerns and neighborhood opposition.",
      "The stadium will be controlled by the city\u2019s schools but the cost of operating and maintaining it will be the team's responsibility.",
      "\u201cThe stadium has been in bad need of repairs and renovation for a very long time. You can see the track is crumbling, the facilities aren't up to state standards. Our young people deserve better,\u201d Wu said, adding that the project aligns with the purpose of the park which has areas of urban wilds meant for quiet enjoyment and other parts like the stadium that \u201cwere meant to draw people in.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will revitalize the mission that we've always had for White Stadium to be a hub for our young people, for our student athletes and the community around them,\u201d she continued.",
      "Jennifer Epstein, the controlling owner of the team which will play in the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, said the stadium project allows for the team to \u201cplay in the heart of the city\u201d and forge a closer ties to the school system and the community.",
      "She estimated the new stadium will offer tens of thousands of students three times more programming than they get now, and double the access for the community. It would also be one of the few stadiums built specifically for professional women's soccer \u2014 the New England Revolution, the men's team, is moving forward on a new Boston-based facility of their own.",
      "\u201cThis public-private-community partnership is really exciting and it's going to turn White Stadium into a top tier professional stadium,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cIt will be a real thrill for everyone to be there.\u201d",
      "The debate over the stadium has played out at scores of meeting and hundreds of conversations over the past 17 months. So far, supporters have won every round of the permitting process and the city is hoping to sign a lease in the coming weeks and for demolition to start soon after.",
      "But lately, supporters have run into unexpected challenges.",
      "Wu acknowledged this week that the city's price tag for the renovation \u2014 the cost are being split evenly between the team and the city \u2014 has nearly doubled to $91 million due to design changes and rising construction costs. On Tuesday, Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn came out against the proposal, citing the growing costs.",
      "\u201cWe should cancel this proposal immediately and work together with residents and stakeholders across the city to provide the best option not only for our city and supporting a professional women\u2019s soccer team, but one that incorporates the voice of our residents and student athletes as well,\u201d Flynn said in a statement.",
      "Time is also an issue, with supporters warning in court documents that any delays to the March trial on the lawsuit puts the project at risk. Supporters are optimistic the lawsuit will eventually be dismissed.",
      "The team is also seeking input on the team name after its \u201cToo Many Balls\u201d marketing campaign launched in October was criticized as transphobic. In a blog post, the team said it has launched a process to \u201cseek out, listen to, and reflect on input about our team name.\u201d",
      "Opponents, who say they want a professional women's team but not in Franklin Park, nevertheless are relishing the latest bout of bad publicity.",
      "\u201cWe are more confident than ever that Franklin Park will be protected from their scheme to turn this historic parkland into a colossal sports and entertainment complex.\u201d Renee Stacy Welsh, a member of the Franklin Park Defenders, which opposes the project, said in a statement."

      "\u201cNo, you\u2019re never consciously aware you\u2019re dropping the ball,\u201d Taylor said. \"Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "The Broncos responded to the gift by closing the game on a 24-0 blitz after scoring just seven points in their first nine drives.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how it would have played out after that, but I do know we would have had six more points if I had crossed the goal line with that ball,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "Taylor was roasted on social media for his blunder, and it certainly didn\u2019t help him that this was the first weekend of fantasy football playoffs.",
      "In standard scoring leagues, Taylor, a star who gets the starting nod better than 99% of the time in fantasy football, would have produced a 10.1-point play had he held onto the ball a millisecond longer to complete his 41-yard touchdown run.",
      "Instead, the 40-yard run and fumble produced just 2 points in fantasy football because he lost the six points for a TD, two more for a fumble and the .1 because that last yard didn\u2019t count. That\u2019s plenty enough wasted points for countless fantasy football players to have been eliminated from their playoff brackets.",
      "Thus, the extra online outrage.",
      "\u201cThat has never happened to me before,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cand it will never happen again.\u201d",
      "Taylor wasn't alone in his misery Sunday. In Nashville, Cincinnati safety Jordan Battle thought he had a 61-yard fumble return for a touchdown until he dropped the ball just shy of crossing the goal line, just like Taylor did.",
      "In October, Jets rookie receiver Malachi Corely did the same thing, erasing his first NFL touchdown. He has yet to reach the end zone.",
      "Like Battle's blunder, Corely's brain lock didn't end up mattering much because it didn't cost his team a victory. Taylor's blunder turned the game around in Denver, whose win all but snuffed out Indy's slim playoff hopes.",
      "Taylor, Corely and Battle join an ignominious club of pros whose goal line goofs live in infamy.",
      "In 2008, Eagles rookie receiver DeSean Jackson celebrated a touchdown against the Cowboys by flipping the ball behind him \u2014 at the 1-yard line. The most famous goal line gaffe came during Dallas' 53-17 blowout of Buffalo in the Super Bowl following the 1992 season when Don Beebe chased down 290-pound defensive lineman Leon Lett and knocked the ball out of his right hand as he held it out in premature celebration of a touchdown.",
      "Taylor's goof-up seems different because he's not a defender or a rookie and his mistake was indeed consequential. Plus, Taylor is used to scoring touchdowns. He has scored 52 of them in his five-year NFL career after scoring 55 times in his three seasons at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "As a running back, Taylor knows he should have known better.",
      "\u201cYou go over those scenarios, but it just can\u2019t happen,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cNo matter the game, no matter the scenario, you could be up 50, down by 50, in a playoff game, the first game of the season. That should never happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think these offensive guys would hold onto the football getting through the touchdown nowaways,\u201d Denver pass rusher Jonathon Cooper said. \u201cBut as you can see, it still happens. I just hope it never happens to us.\u201d",
      "Actually, it did happen to the Broncos back in the 2013 NFL opener when linebacker Danny Trevathan was about to score a pick-6 in his first NFL start when he dropped the ball as he approached the end zone and it was knocked out of bounds for a touchback.",
      "Although it didn't matter in Denver's 49-27 rout of the Ravens that night, Trevathan got an immediate tongue-lashing from defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, who admonished him to bring the football back with him if he ever happened to get into the end zone.",
      "Trevathan did just that when he scored his first and only NFL touchdown on a 25-yard pick-6 of Philip Rivers' pass two years later.",

      "\u201cThe first term, everybody was fighting me,\u201d Trump said in remarks at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cIn this term, everybody wants to be my friend.\u201d",
      "Tech companies and leaders have now poured millions into his inauguration fund, a sharp increase \u2014 in most cases \u2014 from past pledges to incoming presidents. But what does the tech industry expect to gain out of their renewed relationships with Trump?",
      "A clue to what the industry is looking for came just days before the election when Microsoft executives \u2014 who\u2019ve largely tried to show a neutral or bipartisan stance \u2014 joined with a close Trump ally, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, to publish a blog post outlining their approach to artificial intelligence policy.",
      "\u201cRegulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its costs,\u201d said the document signed by Andreessen, his business partner Ben Horowitz, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the company's president, Brad Smith.",
      "They also urged the government to back off on any attempt to strengthen copyright laws that would make it harder for companies to use publicly available data to train their AI systems. And they said, \u201cthe government should examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to sell technology to the government.\u201d",
      "Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but his campaign said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "Trump's choice to head the Interior Department, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, has spoken openly about the need to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to healthcare to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said on Nov. 15, referring to artificial intelligence. \u201cAnd the AI that\u2019s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to consume more resources, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d",
      "Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "Google may benefit from Trump\u2019s return after he made comments on the campaign trail suggesting a breakup of the company isn\u2019t in the U.S. national interest, after a judge declared its search engine an illegal monopoly. But recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies, suggesting Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Cook\u2019s notoriously rocky relationship with the EU can be traced back to a 2016 ruling from Brussels in a tax case targeting Apple. Cook slammed the bloc\u2019s order for Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in Irish back taxes as \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d",
      "Trump, then in his first term as president, piled on, referring to the European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was spearheading a campaign on special tax deals and a crackdown on Big Tech companies, as someone who \u201creally hates the U.S.\u201d",
      "Brussels was eventually vindicated after the bloc\u2019s top court rejected Apple\u2019s appeal this year, though it didn\u2019t stop Cook from calling Trump to complain, Trump recounted in a podcast in October.",
      "Altman, Amazon and Meta all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which billionaire Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. He recently said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term, while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt. Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly.",
      "And Altman, who is in a legal dispute with AI rival Elon Musk, has said he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence in the incoming administration. Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",

      "Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times with a knife he took from his sister's kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her.",
      "But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and said he didn't realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even hurt.",
      "Jurors received the case, which started  Oct. 14, on Dec. 4.",
      "Momeni was charged with murder in the first degree, but jurors could have found him guilty of murder in the second degree or manslaughter.",
      "A conviction of murder in the second degree carries a sentence of 16 years to life in this case.",
      "Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023.",

      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "Global security leaders are warning that nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending has surged around the world. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s 100-page guidance on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "Here are takeaways from the AP\u2019s reporting on bunkers and the debate over the message building bunkers sends.",
      "The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard. He says his bunker factory, in Sulphur Springs, Texas, is the world\u2019s largest. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern year after year introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year",
      "When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn\u2019t hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.",
      "\u201cThe world\u2019s not becoming a safer place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to be prepared.\u201d",
      "Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there\u2019s a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.",
      "With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California\u2019s Inland Empire.",
      "\u201cIf there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you\u2019d go there too,\u201d said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.",
      "Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside of to extravagant underground mansions.",
      "Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren\u2019t focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",
      "Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren\u2019t necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guidance on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.",
      "But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include \u201cthe rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it\u2019s better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,\u201d said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world\u2019s largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.",
      "Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.",
      "On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia\u2019s first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.",
      "Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.",
      "Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,\u201d he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.",
      "A loaded shotgun at arm\u2019s length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices \u2014 $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 \u2014 and installations \u2014 they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.",
      "Under Hubbard\u2019s doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.",
      "\u201cThe good news about nuclear warfare,\u201d he said, \u201cif there ever was any, that it\u2019s very survivable if you\u2019re not killed in the initial blast.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.",
      "\u201cLook, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,\u201d said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.\u201d",
      "Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans \u2014 who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills \u2014 educated about how to respond.",
      "After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you\u2019re going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,\u201d he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.",
      "The government\u2019s efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.",
      "The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: \u201cBALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d",
      "For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what \u201cseek immediate shelter\u201d actually meant.",
      "Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.",
      "\u201cGently brush your pet\u2019s coat to remove any fallout particles\u201d it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows \u201cenough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.\u201d",
      "Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said \u201cthe scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.\u201d",
      "If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.",
      "Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.",
      "\u201cBunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,\u201d said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Sanders-Zakre called radiation the \u201cuniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,\u201d and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn\u2019t prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. \u201cUltimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.",
      "\u201cEven if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.",
      "\u201cIf we ever get to a point where there\u2019s all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren\u2019t going to protect people,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.\u201d",
      "Next, he said, \u201cwe should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.\u201d",
      "Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he\u2019s disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.",
      "\u201cThe stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.\u201d",
      "McGovern pushed back against FEMA\u2019s efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.",
      "\u201cWhat a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that\u2019s chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.",
      "This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.",
      "The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren\u2019t particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven\u2019t spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.",
      "\u201cWe have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,\u201d the husband said. \u201cIt does provide a sense of security.\u201d",

      "European Union regulators are investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania\u2019s presidential election",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators said Tuesday they're investigating whether TikTok breached the bloc's digital rulebook by failing to deal with risks to Romania's presidential election, which has been thrown into turmoil over allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",
      "The European Commission is escalating its scrutiny of the popular video-sharing platform after Romania's top court canceled results of the first round of voting that resulted in an unknown far-right candidate becoming the front-runner.",
      "The court made its unprecedented decision after authorities in the European Union and NATO member country declassified documents alleging Moscow organized a sprawling social media campaign to promote a long shot candidate, Calin Georgescu.",
      "\u201cFollowing serious indications that foreign actors interfered in the Romanian presidential elections by using TikTok, we are now thoroughly investigating whether TikTok has violated the Digital Services Act by failing to tackle such risks,\u201d European Commission president Ursula on der Leyen said in a press release. \u201cIt should be crystal clear that in the EU, all online platforms, including TikTok, must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "The European Commission is the 27-nation EU's executive arm and enforces the bloc's Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations intended to clean up social media platforms and protect users from risks such as election-related misinformation. It ordered TikTok earlier this month to retain all information related to the election.",
      "In the preliminary round of voting on Nov. 24 Georgescu was an outsider among the 13 candidates but ended up topping the polls. He was due to face a pro-EU reformist rival in a runoff before the court canceled the results.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.",
      "Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.",
      "Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.",
      "Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan\u2019s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.",
      "Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan\u2019s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.",
      "Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.",
      "SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.",
      "Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.",
      "SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.",
      "The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.",
      "After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.",
      "SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled \u201cAI Revolution\u201d laying golden eggs.",
      "Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.",
      "Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.",
      "Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.",
      "Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump\u2019s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.",
      "SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.",
      "Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,\u201d said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.",

      "Experts say it\u2019s easy to confuse drones and airplanes, especially at night",
      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is, \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away, and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a higher-pitched buzzing noise than that generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multicopter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax; she has appealed.",
      "There's no parallel between unreliable blood test technology and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",

      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

    "summary": "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

    "story": [
      "Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey within the past week have shown little to no evidence of anything nefarious or threatening",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey in the past week have found \u201clittle to no evidence\u201d of anything nefarious or threatening, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as calls grew for action to address the mysterious nighttime sightings of suspected unmanned flights across the northeastern U.S.",
      "Murphy told reporters in Trenton that there were 12 sightings of suspected drones in the state on Saturday and one on Sunday. He declined to go into detail about the detection equipment, but said it was powerful enough to disable the drones, although he added that is not legal on U.S. soil.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, echoed calls by state officials elsewhere for Congress to allow them to deal with drones. Nearly all the power now rests with the federal government.",
      "\"It is extraordinary to me that, that a nation as great as ours and as powerful as ours has the deficiencies that we have now seen in living color as it relates to drone incursions,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have repeatedly said there are no signs that any drone operators have shown bad intent, nor is there evidence of foreign involvement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "But that hasn't reassured everyone. Conspiracy theories about foreign actors, the U.S. government and the \u201cdeep state,\u201d abound online, while elected officials concerned about threats to military bases, airports and other locations have increased their calls for federal officials to act.",
      "The skeptics include President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested Monday that \"the government knows what is happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur military knows and our president knows and for some reason they want to keep people in suspense,\u201d Trump said. He refused to say whether he had been briefed on the drone sightings.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat, told The Associated Press that officials could do a better job helping the public to understand what is going on, especially when people wrongly conclude they are seeing unmanned aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhat the public could use is like walking through that rather than just, you know, as a statement that says nothing, nothing to be concerned about,\u201d he said. \"I think it\u2019s reached a level of just public attention that some greater level of depth is necessary.\u201d",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no supporting evidence for the president-elect's statement Monday that information is being withheld and that a lack of faith in institutions is playing a key part in the saga.",
      "\u201cNothing that I\u2019m seeing, nothing that I\u2019ve engaged in gives me any impression of that nature. But like, I get it, some people won\u2019t believe me, right? Because that\u2019s the level of distrust that we face.\u201d",
      "Over the past two days, New York and Pennsylvania officials have also requested drone-detecting equipment from federal officials.",
      "\"It is imperative our communities in Pennsylvania are protected and questions on the presence of these drones are answered,\u201d U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, wrote in a letter to Mayorkas on Monday. \"State-of-the-art radar systems will provide insights into where these drones are deploying from and what the motives for their flights may be.\u201d",
      "After reports of drones in Connecticut, state police said they were monitoring drone activity and state officials said analysts were comparing reported sightings with federal flight data.",
      "\u201cOne of the drone sightings had the word Frontier on the back, that was an airline,\u201d Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said Monday. \u201cBut some of them are big and unexplained and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this. Right now, what we do is we make sure that our security and airports are secure.\u201d",
      "At a media briefing on Monday, the Pentagon's press secretary, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said defense officials have seen no indication that the drones flying over multiple locations in the U.S. are being controlled by a foreign country. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, he said, there are approximately 1 million registered drones in the U.S. and about 8,000 are flying any given day.",
      "Ryder said that while military bases overseas can use surveillance methods that quickly address the origin of drones, that power is limited in U.S. airspace because of domestic surveillance laws. He said most drones are operated through either radio frequency transmissions or satellite-guided GPS navigation, which can provide information about the operators. If they're not controlled by those methods, that's another clue, he said.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m kind of talking around it because I don\u2019t necessarily want to get into talking classified capabilities, but the bottom line is that all of that gives us an idea that, hey, these are not foreign origin,\" Ryder said.",
      "Christopher Stadulis, a retired New York City firefighter and drone hobbyist, said he's seen clusters of drones near his home in Clinton Township, New Jersey. He said the lights he has seen at night are different from those used by commercial airlines, and the drones he has seen are very large.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what I\u2019m seeing with the naked eye, you can see it\u2019s not a normal aircraft,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \"This and we don\u2019t have this much traffic, you know, usually on any given night in this area. So it seems like definitely some of them are aircraft that we can\u2019t explain what they are.\u201d",
      "More suspected drone sightings over the weekend led to a temporary airspace shutdown at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, for about four hours late Friday into Saturday, and the arrests of two men in Boston accused of flying a drone \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Logan International Airport.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that he is introducing legislation calling on federal officials to provide public briefings on what they know about the drones and calling for a drone air traffic control system similar to those used for planes. He also wants law enforcement to be given access to drone detectors and the authority to \u201ctake out drones that shouldn't be in the air.\"",
      "\u201cI believe the people I represent and, as I\u2019ve been saying for some time now, the people in New Jersey and around the country deserve answers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve transparency from their government.\u201d",

      "Instead of being a youthful 400 million years old as commonly thought, the icy, shimmering rings could be around 4.5 billion years old just like Saturn, a Japanese-led team reported Monday.",
      "The scientists surmise Saturn\u2019s rings may be pristine not because they are young but because they are dirt-resistant.",
      "Saturn's rings are long thought to be between 100 million and 400 million years old based on more than a decade of observations by NASA's Cassini spacecraft before its demise in 2017.",
      "Images by Cassini showed no evidence of any darkening of the rings by impacting micrometeoroids \u2014 space rock particles smaller than a grain of sand \u2014 prompting scientists to conclude the rings formed long after the planet.",
      "Through computer modeling, the Institute of Science Tokyo's Ryuki Hyodo and his team demonstrated that micrometeoroids vaporize once slamming into the rings, with little if any dark and dirty residue left behind. They found that the resulting charged particles get sucked toward Saturn or out into space, keeping the rings spotless and challenging the baby rings theory. Their results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.",
      "Hyodo said it's possible Saturn's rings could be somewhere between the two extreme ages \u2014 around the halfway mark of 2.25 billion years old. But the solar system was much more chaotic during its formative years with large planetary-type objects migrating and interacting all over the place, just the sort of scenario that would be conducive to producing Saturn's rings.",

      "Reliance on school buses has been waning for years as districts struggle to find drivers and more students attend schools far outside their neighborhoods. As responsibility for transportation shifts to families, the question of how to replace the traditional yellow bus has become an urgent problem for some, and a spark for innovation.",
      "State and local governments decide how widely to offer school bus service. Lately, more have been cutting back. Only about 28% of U.S. students take a school bus, according to a Federal Highway Administration survey concluded early last year. That\u2019s down from about 36% in 2017.",
      "Chicago Public Schools, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest district, has significantly curbed bus service in recent years. It still offers rides for disabled and homeless students, in line with a federal mandate, but most families are on their own. Only 17,000 of the district\u2019s 325,000 students are eligible for school bus rides.",

      "The company has arranged a few hundred rides in its first year operating in Chicago, and El-Amin has been contacting drivers for possible expansion to Virginia, North Carolina and Texas. It is one of several startups that have been filling the void.",
      "Unlike Piggyback Network, which connects parents, HopSkipDrive contracts directly with school districts to assist students without reliable transportation. The company launched a decade ago in Los Angeles with three mothers trying to coordinate school carpools and now supports some 600 school districts in 13 states.",
      "Regulations keep it from operating in some states, including Kentucky, where a group of Louisville students has been lobbying on its behalf to change that.",
      "After the district halted bus service to most traditional and magnet schools, the student group known as The Real Young Prodigys wrote a hip-hop song titled \u201cWhere My Bus At?\u201d The song\u2019s music video went viral on YouTube with lyrics such as, \u201cI\u2019m a good kid. I stay in class, too. Teachers want me to succeed, but I can\u2019t get to school.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose bus driver shortages are not really going away,\u201d HopSkipDrive CEO Joanna McFarland said. \u201cThis is a structural change in the industry we need to get serious about addressing.\u201d",
      "HopSkipDrive has been a welcome option for Reinya Gibson\u2019s son, Jerren Samuel, who attends a small high school in Oakland, California. She said the school takes care to accommodate his needs as a student with autism, but the district lined up the transportation because there is no bus from their home in San Leandro.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, people used to talk about kids in the short yellow buses. They were associated with a physical disability, and they were teased or made fun of,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cNobody knows this is support for Jerren because he can\u2019t take public transportation.\u201d",
      "Encouragement from his mother helped Jerren overcame his fear about riding with a stranger to school.",
      "\u201cI felt really independent getting in that car,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies catering to kids claim to screen drivers more extensively, checking their fingerprints and requiring them to have childcare or parenting experience. Drivers and children are often given passwords that must match, and parents can track a child\u2019s whereabouts in real time through the apps.",
      "Kango, a competitor to HopSkipDrive in California and Arizona, started as a free carpooling app similar to the PiggyBack Network and now contracts with school districts. Drivers are paid more than they would typically get for Uber or Lyft, but there are often more requirements such as walking some students with disabilities into school, Kango CEO Sara Schaer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a curbside-to-curbside, three-minute situation,\u201d Schaer said. \u201cYou are responsible for getting that kid to and from school. That\u2019s not the same as transporting an adult or DoorDashing somebody\u2019s lunch or dinner.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, some families that have used Piggyback said they have seen few alternatives.",
      "Concerned about the city\u2019s rising crime rate, retired police officer Sabrina Beck never considered letting her son take the subway to Whitney Young High School. Since she was driving him anyway, she volunteered through PiggyBack also to drive a freshman who had qualified for the selective magnet school but had no way to get there.",
      "\u201cTo have the opportunity to go and then to miss it because you don\u2019t have the transportation, that is so detrimental,\u201d Beck said. \u201cOptions like this are extremely important.\u201d",
      "After the bus route that took her two kids to elementary school was canceled, Jazmine Dillard and other Chicago parents thought they had convinced the school to move up the opening bell from 8:45 a.m. to 8:15 a.m., a more manageable time for her schedule. After that plan was scrapped because the buses were needed elsewhere at that time, Dillard turned to PiggyBack Network.",
      "\u201cWe had to kind of pivot and find a way to make it to work on time as well as get them to school on time,\u201d she said.",

      "The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility\u201d and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",
      "Cabell \u2014 a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid \u2014 expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year.",
      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is urging the federal government to deploy advanced drone-tracking technology following weeks of reported drone sightings in parts of New York and New Jersey that have stirred fear and bewilderment",
      "BOSTON -- After weeks of fear and bewilderment about the drones buzzing over parts of New York and New Jersey, elected officials are urging action to identify and stop the mysterious flights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "\u201c'We don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer,\u201d he said.",
      "National security officials have said the drones don\u2019t appear to be a sign of foreign interference or a public safety threat. But because they can\u2019t say with certainty who is responsible for the sudden swarms of drones over parts of New Jersey, New York and other eastern parts of the U.S. \u2014 or how they can be stopped \u2014 leaders of both political parties are demanding better technology and powers to deal with the drones.",
      "Sen. Chuck Schumer called Sunday for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to deploy better drone-tracking technology to identify the drones and their operators.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers have tremendous questions about it,\u201d Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters about the drone sightings. \u201cWe are going to get the answers for them.\u201d",
      "The federal government did little to answer those questions in its own media briefings Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "Some of the drones reported above parts of New York and New Jersey have turned out to be \u201cmanned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the Northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter.\u201d",
      "Last year, federal aviation rules began requiring certain drones to broadcast their remote identification, including the location of their operators. It\u2019s not clear whether that information has been used to determine who is behind the drones plaguing locations over New York and New Jersey. Mayorkas\u2019 office didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether they\u2019ve been able to identify drones using this capability.",
      "Schumer wants the federal government to use a recently declassified radio wave technology in New York and New Jersey. The radio wave detector can be attached to a drone or airplane and can determine whether another flying object is a bird or a drone, read its electronic registration, and follow it back to its landing place. Schumer said state and local authorities do not have the authority to track drones.",
      "On Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said federal officials were sending a drone detection system to the state.",
      "\u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The governor did not immediately provide additional details, including where the system will be deployed.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month over parts of New Jersey, raising concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Drones are now being reported all along the northern East Coast, with suspicious sightings in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to news reports.",
      "Some U.S. political leaders, including Trump, have called for much stronger action against the drones, including shooting them down.",
      "Certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security have the power to \u201cincapacitate\u201d drones, Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cBut we need those authorities expanded,\u201d he said.",
      "A bill before the U.S. Senate would enhance some federal agencies\u2019 authority and give new abilities to local and state agencies to track drones. It would also start a pilot program allowing states and local authorities to disrupt, disable or seize a drone without prior consent of the operator.",
      "\u201cWhat the drone issue points out are gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department,\" Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s pick to be his national security adviser, said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \"Americans are finding it hard to believe we can\u2019t figure out where these are coming from.\u2019\u2019",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Cook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.",
      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",

      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.

      "Police identified the suspect in the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison as Natalie Rupnow, a student at the school who went by the name Samantha.",
      "After allegedly killing a teacher and a classmate, and leaving five others injured, including two students in critical condition, Rupnow died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.",
      "\"It's a very sad but a rare thing to have a female school shooter,\" said Don Mihalek, a retired senior special agent for the Secret Service and an ABC News contributor. \"Historically, and the studies show, that typically it's a white male student or former student that ends up committing these acts of violence in schools.\"",
      "The U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) studied 41 incidents of targeted school violence incidents between 2008 and 2017, including those where no one was injured, and found that 83% of the suspects were male and 17% were female.",
      "Another study by the FBI found that of the 49 shooters involved in 48 active shooting incidents in the United States in 2023, 98% were male.",
      "Among the perpetrators who committed school shootings in 2023 was 28-year-old Audrey Hale, who killed three students and three staff members at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee, where authorities said she was once a student. Hale owned seven firearms, including three used in the shooting at the private school, according to police. Officials said that Hale was being treated for an unspecified emotional disorder. Hale was killed on the scene by two officers.",
      "A police spokesperson told ABC News that Hale was assigned female at birth and pointed to a social media account linked to Hale that included the use of the pronouns he/him.",
      "An FBI review of 345 suspects involved in 333 active shooting incidents between 2000 and 2019, including 62 that occurred in educational environments, 332 were male and 13 were female.",
      "The Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks all shootings in the United States, found that of the 805 school shooting incidents since 2012, 157 involved female \"participants.\"",
      "The National Center for Education Statistics also found that 94% of the active shooters in education settings between 2000 and 2022 were male.",
      "Madison police investigators have not yet suggested a motive for Monday's school shooting nor have they said whether the victims were specifically targeted.",
      "The suspect's parents are cooperating with the investigation, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes told ABC News.",
      "Students in kindergarten through 12th grade attend the Christian school. Police said the shooting was contained to \"a classroom in a study hall full of students from multiple grade levels.\"",
      "Police have also yet to say where the suspect got her hands on the handgun used in the shooting.",
      "\"In almost all of these situations, the students that have access to weapons have generally accessed them from parents, family,\" Mihalek said.",
      "Mihalek said one of the few female active shooters in recent years that he could recall was Portia Odufuwa, then 37, who opened fire inside Dallas' Love Field Airport in 2022 before she was shot and wounded by police. No one else was injured in the shooting and Odufuwa was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2023 on charges of aggravated assault.",
      "Other female active shooters include Jennifer San Marco, a former U.S. Postal employee who in January 2006 shot and killed six people at a mail processing and distribution center near Santa Barbara, California, after killing her neighbor, according to police. San Marco died from suicide.",
      "In 2015, Tashfeen Malik, 29, and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, who had both pledged support for ISIS, fatally shot 14 people at a December 2015 holiday party in San Bernardino, California. Malik and Farook were killed in a shootout with police.",
      "Mihalek said investigators are likely combing through the social media footprint of the suspect in the Wisconsin school shooting as they search for a motive.",
      "\"I think there\u2019s a lot of stuff on social media that is creating these mental health crises within kids, especially girls,\" Mihalek said. \"Now, instead of finding your self-worth in good grades, doing well on a sports team, playing a musical instrument well, teachers and parents telling you 'good job,' it\u2019s how many likes, how many people are viewing your feed.\"",
      "Mihalek said that a lot of girls have been the victims of online bullying.",
      "\"It\u2019s tearing apart a kid's fabric and a lot of them don\u2019t know how to handle it because they\u2019re not really capable at these young ages to understand how to handle a bullying incident like that,\" Mihalek said. \u201cIn all schools, the key is homing in on behaviors and the pathways to violence. The critical behaviors that put kids on a pathway to violence are social stressors and grievances. If you're being cyberbullied and told you're no good online by multiple people, that can easily become a grievance.\"",

      "In a sweeping change that could save American consumers time and money -- the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Tuesday finalized a rule that would ban surprise \"junk fees\" for live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals.",
      "The rule would require businesses to disclose total prices upfront, rather than tacking on extra costs like \"convenience fees\" or \"resort fees\" when consumers check out online.",
      "\"Whatever price you see is the price that you are paying at the end, no more mystery surprise fees at the very end of the process, which really cheat consumers and also punish honest businesses,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in an exclusive interview with ABC News.",
      "The FTC said the final rule, which takes effect around April of next year, could save consumers 53 million hours in wasted time searching for the total price of live event tickets or short-term lodging -- equal to about $11 billion in savings over a decade.",
      "The rule would not stop businesses from charging fees. But they would be required to list prices clearly from the onset and to display the total cost more prominently on a website than any other price.",
      "\"This should really provide the American people with just some more clarity and confidence so they don't feel like they're getting cheated or having to be bait and switched by all of these deceptive pricing tactics,\" Khan said. \"This is really about saving people money and saving people time.\"",
      "The change is part of a broader push from the administration of President Joe Biden to lower costs as households have been plagued by stubborn inflation. Last week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a final rule to curb bank overdraft fees.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Biden said: \"Today's announcement builds on work across my Administration to ban junk fees and lower costs -- saving many families hundreds of dollars each year.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has opposed the rule, calling it \"nothing more than an attempt to micromanage businesses' pricing structures, often undermining businesses' ability to give consumers options at different price points.\"",
      "The business lobbying group has already sued the FTC over other regulations, including a rule to ban noncompete agreements for millions of workers.",
      "Asked about the likelihood the junk fee rule would face challenges in court, Khan told ABC News the FTC is on \"firm legal grounds.\"",
      "\"We've also seen bipartisan proposals in Congress to take on these junk fees in these in these industries,\" Khan said. \"I can't predict the future, but I'd be very surprised if something that's just common sense was going to be stripped away.\"",
      "At the helm of the FTC, Khan has been credited with ushering in a new era of anti-trust regulation, challenging the business models of major corporations in industries ranging from Big Tech to pharmaceuticals. Her aggressive approach quickly made her a prominent target among conservatives and Wall Street investors.",
      "President-elect Trump announced last week he nominated Andrew Ferguson, a current Republican FTC commissioner, to replace Khan.",
      "\"These junk fees have really proliferated across the economy, and I would want to make sure that future enforcers and future policy makers were taking on these junk fees across the economy,\" Khan told ABC News.",
      "As for her political future, Khan said she's still laser-focused on her current role.",
      "\"I'm just focused on doing my job in the in the days and weeks we have left,\" she said. \"I've just been really thrilled to see the enormous support across the country for a strong and vigorous FTC.\""

      "\"I think it's evidence of how deeply ingrained in the Republican Party the belief that the election was stolen in 2020 -- and so it's not a disqualifier in the party. If anything, it's a badge of honor in the party to have stood up and fought the results of the 2020 election,\" he said.",
      "Following Biden being declared the winner in 2020, Trump filed lawsuits in several battleground states in an attempt to overturn the election results, arguing the election was \"stolen.\" However, though his lawsuits led to the 2020 election results being contested in court, his claims proved to be unfounded.",
      "VanMiddlesworth, who co-chairs the organization's anti-subversion task force, said there are relatively limited requirements to be an elector and that there likely are no legal issues against the electors participating again, even those who face charges. He emphasized as well that the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, passed in 2022, made the Electoral College process much clearer and in part has contributed to a smoother certification process this year.",
      "\"The job of the electors is to vote for whoever their state voted for,\" VanMiddlesworth said. \"Truthfully, their identity shouldn't affect that and should not matter.\"",
      "He added that \"there's nothing really untoward this year about what they're doing,\" as they are set to vote properly for whom their states voted for.",
      "Prosecutors in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin brought criminal cases against some of the fake electors, though many of the cases have been beset by issues.",
      "The criminal case in Georgia against Trump and multiple defendants, including three fake electors, has been stalled since June while an appeals court considers the former president's challenge to Judge Scott McAfee's decision not to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over a relationship with a prosecutor. The judge overseeing the Arizona fake electors case recused himself after he told fellow judges to respond to attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nevada fake electors case was dismissed earlier this year over a venue issue, though the state's attorney general refiled the case in a different county.",

      "Kennedy, a former Democrat who allied with Trump during the 2024 election, has faced questions over several of his health-related beliefs.",
      "He has in the past promoted the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism, and a lawyer helping Kennedy hire staffers for the incoming administration has pushed for the revocation of the federal approval for the polio vaccine. His support of abortion rights could threaten support from Republicans, and his opposition to things like hog farm subsidies for seed oils, among other things, could irk senators from agriculture-heavy states.",
      "To be sure, Trump's policies are anticipated to rule the day within his own administration for the next four years, but Kennedy's tour on Capitol Hill could look to allay some concerns voiced by Republicans, including outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "\"Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed -- they're dangerous,\" McConnell, a polio survivor, said in a statement Friday. \"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\"",

      "The meeting comes after Trump said in a news conference on Monday that he has a \u201cwarm spot\u201d in his heart for TikTok, crediting the app for helping him win over young voters in last month's presidential election. CNN was the first to report on the meeting.",
      "Trump originally tried to ban TikTok in his first administration, but has since reversed course, vowing on the campaign trail to \u201csave\u201d the app. It\u2019s not clear how he would do so, given the legislation passed with strong bipartisan support and would require approval from both the House and Senate.",
      "TikTok filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday seeking a temporary injunction that would delay the ban on the app from taking effect while the company seeks formal review by the justices.",
      "President Joe Biden signed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was part of a massive, $95 billion foreign aid package passed by Congress, in April. As part of the act, TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users, is forced to sell the company from its current Chinese-based owner ByteDance.",
      "Biden and some congressional leaders argued that the ultimatum against TikTok was necessary because of security concerns about ByteDance and its connections to the Chinese government.",
      "Lawmakers have warned Apple and Google to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores on Jan. 19. They also wrote to TikTok\u2019s CEO, urging him to look for a buyer.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 07:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence related \u201centirely to unofficial conduct\u201d and \u201cposes no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Judge Juan Merchan said the evidence \"poses no danger\" to the executive branch.",
      "The New York judge in President-elect Donald Trump's criminal hush money case ruled Monday that the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision does not apply to that case.",
      "Trump had sought to dismiss his criminal indictment and vacate the jury verdict on the grounds that prosecutors, during the trial last May, introduced evidence relating to Trump's official acts as president, after the Supreme Court later ruled in July that Trump is entitled to presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken while in office.",
      "However, Judge Juan Merchan said on Monday that the evidence in Trump's hush money case related \"entirely to unofficial conduct\" and \"poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the Executive Branch.\"",
      "Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. Judge Merchan has yet to hand down a sentence.",
      "In his ruling Monday, Merchan found that there was \"overwhelming evidence of guilt\" that led the jury to convict Trump at trial.",
      "Trump's attorneys, arguing for immunity, had emphasized the importance of former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks' testimony, including her recounting of interactions with Trump in 2018 when reporting about the alleged hush money payment to Stormy Daniels broke, to demonstrate Trump's knowledge of the payment and his preference that the story came out after the election.",
      "Defense lawyers used a similar argument to argue that tweets from Trump -- which prosecutors used to demonstrate an alleged \"pressure campaign\" to prevent Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen from cooperating with authorities in 2018 -- were official communications protected by immunity because the posts \"fall well within the core authority of the Nation's Chief Executive.\"",
      "But Merchan on Monday rejected Trump's argument that the testimony of Hicks, Trump's Twitter posts about Cohen, and other evidence, constitute official acts.",
      "\"Just as the title of Communications Director does not bestow absolute immunity to any and all communications with Ms. Hicks, neither does mere reference to the Justice Department convert a Tweet to an official act,\" Merchan wrote in his ruling.",
      "\"It is therefore logical and reasonable to conclude that if the act of falsifying records to cover up the payments so that the public would not be made aware is decidedly an unofficial act, so too should the communications to further that same cover-up be unofficial,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Trump has also offered another argument that he is entitled to presidential immunity because he is now president-elect, which Merchan has yet to rule on.",
      "Last week, the Manhattan district attorney's office urged Merchan to preserve the jury's verdict and sentence Trump at some later date following his second term, but Trump's attorneys blasted that proposal as \"thuggish tactics.\"",
      "In a letter accompanying Monday's ruling, Merchan referenced a forthcoming filing from Trump's lawyers alleging \"juror misconduct,\" which has yet to be made public.",
      "Merchan wrote that Trump's argument \"consists entirely of unsworn allegations,\" but that he will allow the president-elect's lawyers to file a redacted version of their claims.",
      "\"Thus, this Court finds that to allow the public filing of the letters without redactions and without the benefit of a hearing would only serve to undermine the integrity of these proceedings while simultaneously placing the safety of the jurors at grave risk,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "The judge said that he would consider Trump's claims if he submitted a motion to throw out the case with sworn testimony backing up the allegation of juror misconduct, rather than the unsworn allegations provided by Trump's lawyers in their recent filing.",
      "\"Allegations of juror misconduct should be thoroughly investigated. However, this Court is prohibited from deciding such claims on the basis of mere hearsay and conjecture,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Merchan's letter did not provide any additional context about Trump's allegation of juror misconduct, and Trump's filings have not been posted to the court's public docket.",

    "story": [
      "The bill passed the Senate last week and awaits a House vote.",
      "Paris Hilton said she was shopping in Saks Fifth Avenue in New York last week when she heard The Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act -- a piece of legislation she\u2019s tirelessly lobbied for over the past three years -- had passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous support.",
      "The celebrity hotel heiress told ABC News that she was with her sister, \u201cdoing a little girls, sister holiday shopping,\u201d when she got a FaceTime call with the update that the bill, which would place greater federal safeguards on institutional youth treatment programs, had hit its first major legislative milestone.",
      "Hilton for years has been an outspoken, public advocate for reform in congregate care facilities and residential treatment programs for \"troubled\" minors. She\u2019s brazenly described her own traumatizing experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah when she was a teenager.",
      "\u201cWe were all just bawling, in tears, just so proud and so happy, and the whole survivor community is just -- everybody is just so so grateful and so happy, and they feel so validated that they're being listened to,\u201d the entrepreneur, DJ, model and actress told ABC News about her reaction to the bill\u2019s Senate passage on Wednesday.",
      "Now, with only a week left in the 118th Congress, Hilton is urging House leaders to prioritize the measure and bring it to the floor for a vote \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're all just hoping and praying that they'll do the right thing,\u201d said Hilton, who is headed back to Washington D.C. to meet with House members on Monday.",
      "\u201cI just really hope that they, you know, don't let politics stand in the way of saving children's lives. This is so urgent, because the House of Representatives has to pass this bill in the next week before the end of this year's session, or else the bill will die. We would have to do it all over again.\u201d",
      "ABC News did not receive a response from Speaker Mike Johnson on whether he'd consider bringing the legislation to the floor for a vote during the final week of the session. The legislation-- which would ordinarily need to pass through the House Energy and Commerce committee before it could get called by leaders to the floor-- is able to be fast-tracked by bypassing that step, according to a source familiar with committee business.",
      "\"When the U.S. Senate came together in a rare show of unity to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act unanimously on Wednesday December 11th, it was one of the best moments of my life. It was proof that when we listen to survivors and put politics aside, we can create real, meaningful change. But this journey isn\u2019t over. I can\u2019t celebrate until this bill becomes law, and now it\u2019s up to the U.S House of Representatives to finish what the Senate started,\" Hilton wrote in an open letter shared to her Instagram page on Monday.",
      "\"To Leader Scalise, Speaker Johnson, and every member of the House: I urge you to think about the children who can\u2019t speak for themselves. They\u2019re relying on us\u2014on you\u2014to stand up for their safety and dignity. Passing this bill would be a testament to what we can achieve when we lead with empathy and courage.\"",
      "Hilton has traveled to Washington every six to 10 months starting in October 2021, according to her spokesperson, each time asking Congress to reform youth residential treatment facilities.",
      "She\u2019s met individually with members like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who thanked Hilton after the bill\u2019s passage last week for her work on the issue, and Republicans like Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina.",
      "Some of her biggest advocates have been the cosponsors of the bill: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Hilton said.",
      "\"A lack of oversight and transparency in residential youth programs has allowed for the abuse of children in facilities across the country for far too long,\" Cornyn said in a statement after the bill passed.",
      "\"I'm proud that the Senate unanimously passed this legislation to ensure the vulnerable children in these facilities are protected, and I want to thank the countless advocates who have bravely shared their stories to help end institutional child abuse.\"",
      "Hilton also testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in June, emotionally recounting her experience being at Provo Canyon School as a teen.",
      "\u201cThese programs promised healing, growth, and support, but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely, or even look out a window for two years,\u201d she testified in 2023. \u201cI was force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff. I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked, and thrown into solitary confinement.\u201d",
      "The Provo school in Utah, which is still operating today, released an updated statement in June 2024 saying they couldn't comment on the operations or student experiences at the school prior to August 2000, when it had changed ownership shortly after Hilton's stint there. Provo said it did not \u201ccondone or promote any form of abuse,\" in their statement.",
      "Hilton has gone to the White House to advocate for child welfare, meeting with policy staff in May 2022. Should the bill pass through the House this week, it would land on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law before the end of his term. Hilton and her team expressed confidence in the president\u2019s willingness to sign the measure.",
      "\u201cWe have had some prior conversations with the White House about the bill, and we don't have a reason to believe that they wouldn't sign it into law,\u201d Hilton\u2019s spokesperson said.",
      "The socialite\u2019s push for congregate-care reform started in 2021, when she came to Washington in support of a similar measure, the Federal Accountability for Congregate Care Act, which was a different bill that was introduced in October 2021 and led by Khanna, Merkley, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and then-Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "Before her visit in 2021, Hilton had opened up about her 11-month experience at Provo Canyon school in her 2020 documentary \"This is Paris,\" and in a Washington Post op-ed.",
      "Hilton told ABC News that the lobbying process for her has been painful but also cathartic.",
      "\u201cIt's been a lot of work\u2026it's not easy to speak about so many things are so painful and traumatic, but I know that it's so important just to be able to be a voice for those who don't, and I'm so grateful to be able to use my platform and my voice just to ensure that no more children are traumatized in the name of treatment,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been also just a very healing experience to see what an impact it's made\u2026it's been just incredibly healing and cathartic.\u201d",
      "Hilton is in New York with her friend and \"The Simple Life\" co-star Nicole Richie to promote a reboot of their iconic show, but said her work on issues related to the troubled teen industry was her most significant venture.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of a lot of things in my life, but the work -- my advocacy work that I'm doing to protect children -- is the thing that I'm most proud of, and this is what I want my legacy to be,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "If the bill doesn\u2019t pass this session, Hilton said she would continue to fight for the issue.",
      "\u201cI won't stop fighting until change is made. This is my lifelong mission and I really believe it's my true purpose in life. I will not stop fighting for these children and being a voice for them.\u201d",

      "Kennedy's chances of getting confirmed by the Senate aren't clear. His past comments questioning vaccine science and the food industry could lose -- and gain -- votes on either side of the aisle depending on how he talks about his plans for the incoming administration.",
      "Here are three questions surrounding his nomination:",
      "Kennedy has said he's not opposed to all vaccines. He says he fully vaccinated, with the exception of the COVID-19 shot, and that he has vaccinated his children.",
      "Kennedy also has falsely claimed that childhood vaccines cause autism, even though the study claiming that link has been retracted and numerous other high-quality studies have found no evidence that vaccines are tied to autism.",
      "In addition, Kennedy has questioned the safety of the polio vaccine and enlisted the help of a longtime adviser and anti-vaccine advocate, Aaron Siri, to vet potential job candidates for the incoming administration.",
      "Siri petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine on behalf of an anti-vaccination advocacy group.",
      "Katie Miller, a transition spokesperson, said Kennedy and Siri have never spoken about Siri's petitions.",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy believes the polio vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Richard Besser, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an ABC News contributor, said senators should ask Kennedy if he would consider using his new post to discourage local school districts from requiring vaccinations.",
      "While state -- not federal -- laws establish vaccination requirements for local schools, they rely heavily on the recommendations by the CDC and FDA, which Kennedy would oversee as health secretary, if confirmed. Currently, all 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring vaccines to attend schools, although many offer exemptions.",
      "\"What will you do to make sure that parents can feel comfortable sending their children to school protected from measles, whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable diseases if vaccines are no longer required?\" Besser said senators should be asking Kennedy.",
      "On questioning the polio vaccine, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history and a polio survivor, said last week that anyone seeking Senate confirmation would \"do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\"",
      "Confirmation bias is the idea that people often seek out information that supports their own deeply held beliefs, rather than be open to accepting new information that might challenge their ideas.",
      "When it comes to the polio vaccination, Kennedy has said he's willing to say that he's wrong but that he has yet to see information that would convince him.",
      "\"If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong ... I'm going to put that on my Twitter and I'm going to say I was wrong,\" he said in a podcast last year with Lex Fridman.",
      "It's likely several senators will ask Kennedy whether he'd be willing to change his mind on vaccines based on data, or if he's already convinced that the data is wrong or manipulated.",
      "Critics say Kennedy is willfully ignoring the information that's out there already. In a letter obtained by The New York Times, more than 75 Nobel Prize winners urged senators to block his nomination, citing his \"lack of credentials or relative experience\" in matters of medicine, science and public health.",
      "\"In view of his record, placing Mr. Kennedy in charge of [the Department of Health and Human Services] would put the public's health in jeopardy and undermine America's global leadership in the health sciences, in both the public and commercial sectors,\" the laureates wrote.",
      "Kennedy finds the most political consensus when he talks about America's obesity crisis and blames the high levels of sugar, sodium and fat in ultra-processed foods. A longtime environmental advocate, he's also taken aim at the use of additives pushed by food companies -- earning him kudos from some Democrats.",
      "\"We're prioritizing corporations feeding us unhealthy products instead of family farmers growing fresh, healthy foods - and we let too many dangerous chemicals flood our food system,\" said Sen. Cory Booker last month after Kennedy's nomination was announced.",
      "\"We all must come together to build a system that works for all,\" he added.",
      "But one big question many senators will likely ask is how Kennedy plans to turn around America's eating habits in a way that doesn't hurt U.S. farmers or heavily regulate agricultural businesses that are key political supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. During Trump's first administration, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue rolled back Obama-era rules that sought to limit sodium and sugar in children's school lunches that accept federal subsidies.",
      "FDA Administrator Robert Califf, who will step down when Trump takes office in January, testified recently before a Senate committee that there's a lot we still don't know about food science and safety. When the FDA does move ahead with regulation, he said the rule is often challenged in court.",
      "\"What sounds simple, given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, [is] the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals -- every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress -- it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" he said.",

      "ROVANIEMI, Finland -- Shuffling across icy ground on a cold December afternoon, lots of tourist groups poured into Santa Claus Village, a winter-themed amusement park perched on the edge of the Arctic Circle.",
      "They frolic in the snow, take a reindeer sleigh ride, sip a cocktail in an ice bar or even meet Saint Nick himself in the capital of Finnish Lapland, Rovaniemi, which happily calls itself the \u201cofficial hometown of Santa Claus.\"",
      "The Santa Claus Village theme park, which attracts more than 600,000 people annually, is especially popular during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cThis is like my dream came true,\u201d beamed Polish visitor Elzbieta Nazaruk. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",
      "It\u2019s a feeling that has been echoed in other popular European travel destinations, including Barcelona, Amsterdam, Malaga and Florence.",
      "Across the continent, locals have protested against \u201cover-tourism\u201d \u2014 which generally describes the tipping point at which visitors and their cash stop benefiting residents and instead cause harm by degrading historic sites, overwhelming infrastructure and making life markedly more difficult for those who live there.",
      "Now, it seems to have spread north, all the way to the edges of the Arctic Circle.",
      "Rovaniemi counted a record 1.2 million overnight visitors in 2023, almost 30 percent growth on 2022, after rebounding from pandemic travel disruptions.",
      "\u201cNordic is a trend,\u201d Visit Rovaniemi CEO Sanna Karkkainen, said as she stood in an ice restaurant, where snow carvers were working nearby.",

      "Thirteen new flight routes to Rovaniemi Airport opened this year, bringing passengers from Geneva, Berlin, Bordeaux and more. Most tourists come from European countries like France, Germany and the UK, but Rovaniemi\u2019s appeal has also spread further.",
      "Hotel availability is scarce this winter, and Tiina M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, general manager of the 159-room Original Sokos Hotel, expects 2024 to break more records.",
      "Local critics of mass tourism say many apartment buildings in Rovaniemi\u2019s city center are also used for accommodation services during peak season and are thus no longer available for residential use. They say the proliferation of short-term rentals has driven up prices, squeezed out long-term residents, and turned its city center into a \u201ctransient space for tourists.\"",
      "Finnish law prohibits professional accommodation services in buildings intended for residential use, so campaigners are calling on authorities to act.",
      "\u201cThe rules must be enforced better,\u201d said Pakkanen.",
      "Not everyone agrees. Mayor Ulla-Kirsikka Vainio notes some make \u201cgood money\u201d on short-term rentals.",
      "Either way, stricter regulations likely won\u2019t be in place to impact this winter season, and despite the unease expressed by locals, mass tourism to Rovaniemi is probably only going to grow in 2025 \u2014 as visitors want to experience the unique atmosphere up north, especially during the holiday season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas time and we would love to see the Northern Lights,\u201d says Joy, a visitor from Bangkok. \u201cRovaniemi seems to be a good place.\u201d"

      "A federal judge says he won't dismiss a bribery charge against New York Mayor Eric Adams",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge said Tuesday that he won\u2019t dismiss a bribery charge against New York Mayor Eric Adams because prosecutors described the allegations adequately in an indictment.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho wrote in an opinion that an indictment unsealed against the Democrat in September sufficiently details alleged bribery crimes, preventing dismissal of the charge prior to an April trial.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty to corruption charges stemming largely from his relationships with several Turkish government officials and businesspeople from 2015 to 2022. The indictment alleged that he accepted tens of thousands of dollars in overseas travel benefits and illegal campaign donations from people seeking to buy his influence.",
      "The indictment accused him of exploiting a relationship with the Turkish officials and businesspeople that he developed after he became Brooklyn Borough president in January 2014. He became mayor in January 2022.",
      "In his opinion, Ho rejected a request by defense lawyers for Adams to toss out a bribery count that alleged that from the summer of 2021 to the summer of 2022, Adams received free and heavily discounted luxury travel benefits from a Turkish official and others in exchange for wielding his influence to their benefit.",
      "Defense lawyers had argued that the indictment's language was too vague to adequately describe the crime of bribery and that Adams never exercised formal governmental power in the manner that the law requires.",
      "They also claimed Adams did not have formal authority over city fire officials when he was alleged to have pressured them to issue a temporary certificate of occupancy to the Turkish Consulate for what was described as the Turkish House, a newly constructed skyscraper that serves as headquarters to multiple Turkish diplomatic missions.",

      "Some of the women who alleged abuse at Dublin say they have been the victims of similar misconduct at other institutions, and the AP has found multiple arrests and convictions of Bureau of Prisons staff members for sexually abusing prisoners at other federal lockups.",

That reporting led to increased scrutiny from Congress and pledges from the Bureau of Prisons that it would fix problems and change the culture at the prison \u2014 promises that went by the wayside with Thursday\u2019s closure announcement.",
      "Since 2021, at least eight FCI Dublin employees have been charged with sexually abusing inmates.",

      "The family of an environmental activist shot and killed by state troopers near the site of a planned Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center activists call \u201cCop City\" has filed a lawsuit against three law enforcement officers",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- The parents of an environmental activist who Georgia state troopers fatally shot  near the site of a planned Atlanta-area police and firefighter training center filed a lawsuit Tuesday against three law enforcement officers who they say planned and carried out a police raid that led to his death.",
      "Manuel Paez Ter\u00e1n\u2019s family says state troopers used excessive force against the 26-year-old when they fired pepper balls into the protester\u2019s tent after Paez Ter\u00e1n refused to leave on the morning of Jan. 18, 2023. Authorities said Paez Ter\u00e1n then shot at the troopers from inside the tent, wounding one of them and prompting the troopers to return fire, killing the activist.",
      "Authorities were conducting what officials described as a \u201cclearing operation\u201d against those who for months had been camping in the woods near the DeKalb County construction site to protest what critics call \u201cCop City.\u201d",
      "The killing of Paez Ter\u00e1n, who went by the name Tortuguita and used the \u201cthey\u201d pronoun, was a galvanizing moment for the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d movement, with activists across the world holding vigils and painting murals in honor of Tortuguita, who friends said was dedicated to helping others and protecting the environment. Authorities have portrayed Paez Ter\u00e1n as an out-of-state radical who wrote in their journal that police officers should be killed.",
      "Ever since Paez Ter\u00e1n's death, their parents have complained that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has refused to give them answers about the events surrounding his death. Last year, the family commissioned an autopsy that concluded that Paez Ter\u00e1n was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air when they were shot more than a dozen times.",
      "\u201cThe story of Manuel\u2019s death is still being written,\u201d attorney Brian Spears said at a news conference Tuesday morning in Decatur, a few miles from where the training center is nearing completion. \u201cThe objective of this lawsuit is to learn the truth about who planned the raid and to hold them responsible.\u201d",
      "Paez Ter\u00e1n had moved to Georgia from Florida in 2022 to join activists who had been camping in the woods and calling themselves \u201cforest defenders.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says GBI Special Agent Ryan Long planned a \u201craid\u201d that targeted protesters for expressing their political beliefs, violating their First Amendment rights.",
      "The protesters were camped out legally on public land, not on the construction site itself, the family's lawyers said, and Long was wrong to instruct officers to arrest campers for \u201ccriminal trespass,\" thereby violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.",
      "The lawsuit said that when Paez Ter\u00e1n \u201cstated the desire to remain in the forest,\u201d Trooper Mark Lamb ordered Trooper Bryland Myers to fire pepper balls into the activist's tent, trapping the protester in an enclosed space with chemicals and making Paez Ter\u00e1n \u201creasonably believe that they were going to die.\u201d",
      "Lamb and Myers were among the six troopers who fired their guns at the activist after Paez Ter\u00e1n fired at them, officials have said.",
      "A GBI spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.",
      "Body camera footage from four Atlanta officers involved does not show the shooting itself, the GBI has said. But the agency said footage shows the officers encountered Paez Ter\u00e1n in a tent in the woods and fired in self-defense after the activist shot at troopers, injuring one, and ignored verbal commands to leave the tent.",
      "A prosecutor declined to charge the troopers who killed Paez Ter\u00e1n, saying their use of deadly force was \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d Investigators have also said ballistics evidence shows the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun Paez Ter\u00e1n legally purchased in 2020.",
      "Activists formed the \u201cStop Cop City\u201d movement to protest the construction of an 85-acre (34-hectare) Atlanta Public Safety and Training Center, which they said would cause environmental damage by cutting down huge swathes of trees and exacerbate flooding fears in a poor, majority-Black neighborhood. They also oppose the use of tens of millions in public funding on what critics describe as being a training ground for \"urban warfare.\u201d",
      "Initially given a $90 million price tag, the cost has since jumped to $115 million, with taxpayer funds paying the majority of that cost, despite city officials' earlier claims that the public obligation would only be $31 million.",
      "The city said the state-of-the-art campus would boost police morale amid hiring and retention struggles while emphasizing \u201cprogressive\" training practices.",
      "Since the fatal encounter, Tortuguita's name has been invoked at numerous protests \u2014 some of which have turned violent, including last year when more than 100 masked activists stormed the construction site and torched equipment while others threw projectiles at retreating officers.",
      "In September 2023, 61 protesters were indicted on racketeering charges, and dozens of activists have been charged with domestic terrorism. Attorney Jeff Filipovits said this was part of a strategy to \u201cdemonize those who hold certain political beliefs.\u201d",
      "\u201cForest defenders are not terrorists,\u201d said Paez Ter\u00e1n's father, Joel Paez. \u201cThey aren't. And my child was with individuals concerned against environmental injustice.\u201d",
      "Paez Ter\u00e1n used to meditate every morning to be close to God and saw the forest as a sacred place, said their mother, Belkis Ter\u00e1n. In honor of Tortuguita \u2014 Spanish for \u201clittle turtle\u201d \u2014 she wore a necklace with a turtle pendant to the news conference.",

      "In a string of visits, dinners, calls, monetary pledges and social media overtures, big tech chiefs have joined a parade of business and world leaders in trying to improve their standing with President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January",
      "NEW YORK -- In a string of visits, dinners, calls, monetary pledges and social media overtures, big tech chiefs \u2014 including Apple's Tim Cook, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos \u2014 have joined a parade of business and world leaders in trying to improve their standing with President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January.",
      "\u201cThe first term, everybody was fighting me,\u201d Trump said in remarks at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cIn this term, everybody wants to be my friend.\u201d",
      "Tech companies and leaders have now poured millions into his inauguration fund, a sharp increase \u2014 in most cases \u2014 from past pledges to incoming presidents. But what does the tech industry expect to gain out of their renewed relationships with Trump?",
      "A clue to what the industry is looking for came just days before the election when Microsoft executives \u2014 who\u2019ve largely tried to show a neutral or bipartisan stance \u2014 joined with a close Trump ally, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, to publish a blog post outlining their approach to artificial intelligence policy.",
      "\u201cRegulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its costs,\u201d said the document signed by Andreessen, his business partner Ben Horowitz, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the company's president, Brad Smith.",
      "They also urged the government to back off on any attempt to strengthen copyright laws that would make it harder for companies to use publicly available data to train their AI systems. And they said, \u201cthe government should examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to sell technology to the government.\u201d",
      "Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but his campaign said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "Trump's choice to head the Interior Department, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, has spoken openly about the need to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cThe AI battle affects everything from defense to healthcare to education to productivity as a country,\u2033 Burgum said on Nov. 15, referring to artificial intelligence. \u201cAnd the AI that\u2019s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there\u2019s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration\u2033 to address it.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to consume more resources, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "\u201cMaybe Big Tech should buy a copy of \u2018The Art of The Deal\u2019 to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,\u201d suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.\u201d",
      "Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "Google may benefit from Trump\u2019s return after he made comments on the campaign trail suggesting a breakup of the company isn\u2019t in the U.S. national interest, after a judge declared its search engine an illegal monopoly. But recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies, suggesting Google won\u2019t be entirely off the hook.",
      "Cook\u2019s notoriously rocky relationship with the EU can be traced back to a 2016 ruling from Brussels in a tax case targeting Apple. Cook slammed the bloc\u2019s order for Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in Irish back taxes as \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d",
      "Trump, then in his first term as president, piled on, referring to the European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was spearheading a campaign on special tax deals and a crackdown on Big Tech companies, as someone who \u201creally hates the U.S.\u201d",
      "Brussels was eventually vindicated after the bloc\u2019s top court rejected Apple\u2019s appeal this year, though it didn\u2019t stop Cook from calling Trump to complain, Trump recounted in a podcast in October.",
      "Altman, Amazon and Meta all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which billionaire Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. He recently said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term, while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt. Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly.",
      "And Altman, who is in a legal dispute with AI rival Elon Musk, has said he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence in the incoming administration. Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "\u201cWe have two multi-billionaires, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are tasked with cutting what they\u2019re saying will be multiple trillions of dollars from the federal budget, reducing the civil service, the workforce,\u201d said Rob Lalka, a business professor at Tulane University.",
      "Musk, he said, has a level of access to the White House that very few others have had -- access that allows him to potentially influence multiple policy areas, including foreign policy, automotive and energy policy through EVs, and tech policy on artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cElon Musk walked into Twitter\u2019s headquarters with a sink and then posted, \u2018let that sink in,\u2018\u201d he said. \u201cElon Musk then posted a status update on X, a picture of himself with a sink in the Oval Office and said, 'Let that sink in.\u2032\""

      "New England shrimp will come back to seafood counters in small amounts next year under a research fishing program",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- New England shrimp, long lost from the marketplace as waters have warmed, will come back to seafood counters in small amounts next year due to a research fishing program.",
      "Also called Maine shrimp or northern shrimp, the small pink crustaceans were long beloved by seafood fans in winter. But for a decade now, the seafood industry has been under a fishing moratorium for the shrimp because of concerns about low population levels, which scientists attribute to climate change and warming oceans.",
      "That moratorium is going to remain in place as the shrimp population has failed to improve, according to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. Yet because the regulatory body said there is interest in collecting data about the shrimp, this coming winter there will be a fishing industry-funded winter sampling program for them.",
      "The program will allow fishermen to catch up to 58,400 pounds (26,490 kilograms) of the shrimp this winter. It's a far cry from the early 2010s when fishermen caught more than 10 million pounds (4.5 million kilograms) of the shrimp per year. But the program will provide important data to better understand the status of the shrimp population while also allowing a small amount of catch, the commission said.",
      "\u201cThe sampling program is intended to run early in the new year from mid/late January through March 2025. Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts are currently working together to finalize the logistics of the program including the start date,\u201d said Chelsea Tuohy, a fishery management plan coordinator with the commission, on Tuesday.",
      "Fishermen long sought the cold water-loving shrimp in the Gulf of Maine, a body of water off New England that has experienced significant warmth in recent years. The commission said in a statement that recent science has found \u201cno improvement in stock status\u201d for the shrimp. The commission has also described the Gulf of Maine as \u201can increasingly inhospitable environment\" for the shrimp.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is still separating some migrant children from parents while holding them after they cross the border despite broad improvements at detention centers in Texas",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- The U.S. still separates some migrant children from parents while holding them after they cross the border despite broad improvements at detention centers in Texas, according to a court-ordered monitor's final report.",
      "The heightened scrutiny of the Border Patrol\u2019s Texas holding facilities is part of broader court-appointed oversight, which President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have criticized.",
      "The report, issued Friday under a monitoring agreement that began in 2022, offers a final glimpse into conditions inside the facilities ahead of Trump's return to office. The report noted improvements to hygiene, food and medical care but found that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents routinely separated children from adult relatives during their time in custody.",
      "Unlike separations that happened under Trump's zero tolerance border policy during his first term, those noted in the report were temporary and did not involve sending adults to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention while they were criminally prosecuted and children to shelters for minors.",
      "At a facility in Donna, Texas, in September, agents \u201ccontinued to routinely hold children separately from parents or trusted adults,\u201d the report said. By November, the monitor called regular visits among family at the same facility \u201cencouraging.\u201d Workers at the facility said they could arrange visits because it was no longer overcrowded.",
      "CBP did not respond to a request for comment on the report.",
      "Advocates sued the Trump administration in 2019, citing reports of children in federal custody who described overcrowding at CBP facilities in Texas, as well as unsafe and unsanitary conditions. That year, nearly 70,000 migrant children entered federal custody, enough to exceed the of capacity a typical NFL stadium.",
      "A 2022 court agreement created a temporary monitoring system that required CBP to provide adequate medical care and supervision. It also required keeping families together or allowing contact for those held separately in custody.",
      "Last week's report noted medical care improved in 2024 but also found hesitancy in sending sick children to a medical facility. In 2023, when CBP was struggling with overcrowding, an 8-year-old girl with heart problems died while in custody in the Rio Grande Valley.",
      "The monitoring agreement ends Jan. 29, 2025, more than a week into Trump's second administration. Leecia Welch, the deputy litigation director at Children\u2019s Rights who represents children in CBP custody under the Flores settlement, expressed concern about what will happen to children without the agreement's oversight.",
      "\u201cThe report highlights the crucial role the independent monitors are playing to keep children safe and shows that CBP is very far from meeting its obligations \u2014 let alone ready for self-monitoring,\u201d Welch said in a written statement.",
      "Broader court oversight of facilities began in 1997 under what is called the Flores settlement, after Jenny Flores, a girl from El Salvador who sued the U.S. government in the 1980s. It was partially lifted in June when the Justice Department argued that new safeguards would in some ways exceed the Flores settlement's standards."

      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers are alleging that his hush money conviction was tainted by juror misconduct, opening a new front in their fight to overturn the verdict and throw out the historic case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers are raising a new claim in their fight to overturn his hush money conviction, alleging that the historic verdict was tainted by juror misconduct.",
      "But prosecutors contend that the allegations in a defense court filing made public Tuesday are \u201cunsworn, unsupported\" hearsay and part of a last-ditch effort to undermine public confidence in the case.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers claimed in a letter to Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan that they had \u201cevidence of grave juror misconduct during the trial.\"",
      "Details of the allegations were redacted and hidden from public view.",
      "The defense letter, dated Dec. 3, was added to the public court docket on Tuesday along with two responses from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which prosecuted the hush money case, dated Dec. 5 and 9.",
      "The development comes as Merchan is weighing a pending defense request to throw out the case in light of his impending return to the White House.",
      "In their written responses, Manhattan prosecutors argued that Trump\u2019s lawyers were trying to muddy the verdict by airing their claims in a letter to the judge rather than a formal motion to dismiss the case. Prosecutors also questioned the defense\u2019s resistance to having Merchan hold a court hearing where their juror misconduct claims could be examined more thoroughly.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, argued in their letter that such a hearing would involve \u201cextensive. time-consuming, and invasive fact finding\" and would interfere with the president-elect\u2019s transition into office. Prosecutors wrote that by opposing a hearing, the defense was trying to force Merchan \u201cto accept their untested, unsworn allegations as true.\u201d",
      "Merchan said in a separate letter Monday that he ordered the reactions both to preserve the integrity of the case and to ensure the safety of jurors, whose names have been kept private. Three of the letter\u2019s seven pages were entirely covered in black ink.",
      "Blanche and Bove\u2019s letter \u201cconsists entirely of unsworn allegations,\u201d Merchan wrote.",
      "Allowing them to be filed publicly without redactions \u201cwould only serve to undermine the integrity of these proceedings while simultaneously placing the safety of the jurors at grave risk,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cAllegations of juror misconduct should be thoroughly investigated,\u201d Merchan wrote. \u201cHowever, this Court is prohibited from deciding such claims on the basis of mere hearsay and conjecture.\u201d",
      "Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier, which he denies. The payment was made shortly before the 2016 election.",
      "On Monday, Merchan rejected Trump\u2019s request to throw out the case on presidential immunity grounds, finding that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s July 1 ruling granting former president\u2019s broad protection from prosecution did not require upending the case.",
      "Trump\u2019s immunity claim was just one of several efforts he and his lawyers have made to get his conviction overturned and the case dismissed.",
      "After Trump won last month\u2019s election, Merchan indefinitely postponed his late November sentencing so both sides could suggest next steps. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that anything other than immediate dismissal would undermine the transfer of power and cause unconstitutional \u201cdisruptions\u201d to the presidency.",
      "Prosecutors, seeking to preserve the verdict, proposed several alternatives.",
      "They included: freezing the case until Trump leaves office in 2029; agreeing that any future sentence won\u2019t include jail time; or treating the case the way some courts do when a defendant dies.",
      "In the last scenario, borrowed from what some states do in such an occurrence, the case would be closed by noting that Trump was convicted but that he wasn\u2019t sentenced and his appeal wasn\u2019t resolved because he took office. Trump\u2019s lawyers branded the concept \u201cabsurd.\u201d They also objected to the other suggestions.",
      "Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20. He\u2019s the first former president to be convicted of a felony and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office."

      "The five-decade push to amend the Constitution to prohibit discrimination based on sex remains stalled. Congress sent the amendment, which guarantees men and women equal rights under the law, to the states in 1972 and gave states seven years to ratify it, later extending the deadline to 1982. But the amendment wasn\u2019t ratified by the required three-quarters of states before the deadline.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A San Francisco jury on Tuesday found a tech consultant guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee, which carries a sentence of 16 years to life, rejecting the defendant's claim that he had acted in self defense.",
      "Jurors took seven days to deliver their verdict against Nima Momeni in the April 4, 2023, death of Lee, a beloved tech mogul who was found staggering on a deserted downtown street, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. Lee, 43, later died at a hospital.",
      "\u201cWe think justice was done here today,\u201d the victim\u2019s brother, Tim Oliver Lee, told reporters. \"What matters today is that we had a guilty verdict and Nima Momeni is going away for a very long time.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Momeni planned the attack on Lee, driving him to an isolated spot under the Bay Bridge and stabbing him three times, including once to the heart, with a knife he took from his sister's kitchen. They say Momeni was angry with Lee for introducing his younger sister to a drug dealer she says gave her GHB and other drugs and then sexually assaulted her.",
      "But Momeni testified on the stand that Lee was the one who attacked him with a knife, angry after the tech consultant chided him about spending more time with his family instead of searching for a strip club that night. Momeni, who studies martial arts, claimed self-defense and said he didn't realize he had fatally wounded Lee or that Lee was even hurt.",
      "The case has drawn national attention, partly given Lee\u2019s status in the tech world. At first, his death enflamed debate over public safety in San Francisco as X owner Elon Musk took to the social media site to post that \u201cviolent crime in SF is horrific and even if attackers are caught, they are often released immediately.\u201d",
      "San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said the verdict showed that the killing was a targeted crime and not an example of random lawlessness in the city.",
      "\u201cWe are a city committed to accountability, we are a city committed to public safety,\u201d Jenkins told reporters after the hearing.",
      "Momeni, 40, has been in custody since his arrest in April 2023, when he was charged with murder in the first degree.",
      "Family members of both men have faithfully attended the trial. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee\u2019s father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other, recoiling at Lee\u2019s autopsy photos and 911 call.",

The courtroom was crowded with Lee\u2019s family and friends and journalists who have been following the high-profile trial.",
      "Lee had created mobile payment service Cash App and was the chief product officer of the cryptocurrency MobileCoin when he died. He had moved to Miami from the San Francisco Bay Area, where his ex-wife Krista Lee lives with their two children.",
      "Both sides agreed on the sequence of events that led to the two men facing off in the early morning hours of April 4. But there is no independent documentation of what they said to each other or who brought out the knife, and video of their final encounter is grainy.",
      "The prosecution said the video showed Momeni stabbing Lee three times. They also said the murder weapon \u2014 a nearly 8-inch paring knife with a roughly 4-inch blade \u2014 had Momeni\u2019s DNA on its handle and Lee\u2019s DNA on the blade.",
      "Two of Momeni\u2019s five attorneys were in court Tuesday, with the others attending via Zoom from Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is obviously very disappointing for us,\u201d said Tony Brass, adding that the team would evaluate for an appeal.",
      "Jurors in the end rejected a charge of murder in the first degree, which required prosecutors prove that Momeni acted deliberately, willfully and with premeditation. Murder in the second degree does not require that element.",
      "Jurors on Tuesday declined to speak to the press.",
      "The afternoon before the stabbing, Lee and Khazar Momeni had been doing drugs and drinking at the apartment of a drug dealer Lee knew. Lee left before Nima Momeni went to pick up his sister, who told him she had been assaulted.",
      "A friend of Lee\u2019s testified Momeni then grilled Lee over the phone about what happened to his sister while at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment. He sent text messages saying that the two men were creeps and sexual predators.",
      "Momeni later hung out with Lee at his sister\u2019s condo until she kicked them out, saying she needed to sleep.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving Khazar Momeni\u2019s posh condo around 2 a.m. and getting into Nima Momeni\u2019s BMW. Other surveillance footage then shows them getting out of the car near the Bay Bridge, where the stabbing took place.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend the last night of his visit with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That\u2019s when he says Lee snapped, yelled at him about questioning his parenting skills and pulled out the knife from his jacket pocket, and attacked.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\u201d Momeni said during trial, in testimony that was rambling and contentious.",
      "He said Lee walked away from the encounter, and showed no evidence of being hurt. He didn\u2019t realize Lee had died until the following day, he said.",
      "\u201cI feel awful to his family, to himself,\u201d Momeni said on the stand. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve it. I don\u2019t think anyone deserved that.\u201d",
      "The prosecution mocked Momeni\u2019s story, pointing out that he never called police to report Lee\u2019s alleged attack or even after he learned Lee had died of stab wounds on the street where he had last seen him.",
      "Prosecutors also showed text messages Khazar Momeni sent her brother, asking where he had dropped off Lee \u2014 a question he sidestepped. She sent a text message to Lee checking on him because her brother came \u201cdown hard\" on him and to thank him for \u201chandling it with class.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't be the top Democrat on a prominent House committee next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats on Tuesday picked 74-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly to lead the party next year atop an influential congressional committee, pushing aside growing calls for generational change in leadership ahead of a second term for Donald Trump.",
      "In a closed-door meeting, the majority of the caucus voted for Connolly to be the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee over 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned on calls to pass the torch to younger leaders. Connolly has seniority on the committee, having served on it for 16 years. The vote was 131-84.",
      "\u201cI think my colleagues were measuring their votes by who\u2019s got experience, who is seasoned, who can be trusted, who\u2019s capable and who\u2019s got a record of productivity and I think that prevailed,\u201d Connolly told reporters after the vote.",
      "The Virginia Democrat on Monday had won the endorsement of a Democratic panel that makes recommendation for committee assignments. But Ocasio-Cortez and her allies had said the initial vote was close enough to keep her in the race and try again at Tuesday's caucus-wide meeting. She did not respond to reporters questions following the vote.",
      "Rep. Annie Kuster, the chair of the New Democratic coalition, said some of her members, who come from swing districts and tend to vote moderately, had concerns about Ocasio-Cortez supporting primaries against other Democrats, even though she pledged not to do that in the closed-door session this week.",
      "\u201cI think there are members that very much want this generational change but I think, members who had only been here a couple of terms gave them pause,\" Kuster said.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez's loss comes as several other younger Democrats won the ranking spots on committees, pushing out more senior members. It's all part of a generational struggle in the party that has grown more urgent following Democrat's electoral defeat last month that handed Republicans complete control of Washington come January.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re all starting to realize that we can\u2019t do things exactly the way we\u2019ve always done them here in the Democratic Party,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig, who was selected to be the top Democrat on Natural Resources after beating out two more senior members for the role.",
      "Rep. Jared Huffman, 60, who was successful in edging out the 74-year-old incumbent to become top Democrat on Agriculture, said that his and Craig's victories represent a \u201chealthy\u201d generation transition.",
      "\u201cBut, this is a team, and it\u2019s a multi-generational team, so we\u2019re not pushing out these other more senior members,\u201d Huffman told reporters after he won. \u201cWe welcome them. They have incredible value.\u201d",
      "The ranking member position on the Oversight committee is now held by Rep. Jamie Raskin, but the Maryland Democrat relinquished the position to seek another prominent post, as top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. The Oversight and Judiciary panels have traditionally been among the most high-profile in Congress, which means both positions will service as prominent foils to Trump and the Republican majority in the House.",
      "Connolly had unsuccessfully run for the Oversight role twice before. He was facing concerns from colleagues over his recent cancer diagnosis. He defended his health status Monday, according to Rep. Don Beyer, one of the Democrats who nominated him for the post.",
      "\u201cGerry pointed out that there\u2019s many people in the room who are cancer survivors, and there was a bunch of heads nodding,\u201d Beyer told reporters. \u201cHis chemo has gone really well and no surgery has been necessary.\u201d",
      "Kuster added, Connolly was very clear, telling colleagues \u201cif he doesn\u2019t have the capacity, if he will step down.\"",
      "Many of Connolly's allies, including himself, denied that this race was about a generational challenge in the Democratic party, but pointed to who is more experienced and ready to lead the party on some of the most urgent issues facing the country."

      "Congressional leaders are nearing the unveiling of an agreement that will keep the federal government funded through March 14 and provide more than $100 billion in emergency aid to help states and local communities recover from Hurricanes Helene and Mi...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders are nearing the unveiling of a spending agreement that will keep the federal government funded through March 14 and provide more than $100 billion in emergency aid to help states and local communities recover from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters.",
      "The stopgap measure would prevent a partial government shutdown set to begin after midnight Friday. It would kick final decisions on this budget year's spending levels to a new Republican-led Congress and to President-elect Donald Trump. The continuing resolution generally continues current spending levels for agencies.",
      "Passage of the measure is one of the final actions that lawmakers will consider this week, before adjourning for the holidays and making way for the next Congress. It's the second short-term funding measure the lawmakers have taken up this fall as they struggled to pass the dozen annual appropriations bills before the new fiscal year began Oct. 1, as they typically do.",
      "While text of the legislation was not yet available Tuesday, House Republican lawmakers emerged from a closed-door meeting saying that the disaster aid would come to about $100 billion, plus another $10 billion in economic assistance would be made available to farmers.",
      "\u201cWe have to be able to help those who are in these dire straits,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters.",
      "Net farm income is projected to decline 4.1% this year after falling 19.4% the year before from the record highs reached in 2022. While the aid to farmers is not as much as some lawmakers were seeking, Johnson indicated more aid could be delivered in the next Congress, saying \u201cwe can't do all it right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cCongress is doing the best it can under difficult circumstances, and I think it will be a big boost for the industry,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "President Joe Biden has sought about $114 billion in disaster aid, submitting a $99 billion request in November, telling lawmakers the funding was \u201curgently needed.\u201d The administration subsequently updated its request to include funding to repair federal facilities damaged due to natural disasters.",
      "As it typically does, Congress is expected to act just before another shutdown deadline. House Republicans generally give lawmakers 72 hours to review text of the legislation, which would push a vote on final passage to Friday if they follow through on that rule. The Senate also is not known for acting speedily, but many lawmakers are anxious to adjourn for the year and make way for the next Congress.",
      "Johnson said he hoped that text of the bill would be available later Tuesday, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said \"negotiations continue between both parties.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously we are getting closer to the December 20th deadline, so time is of the essence for Republicans to reach an agreement with us that we can act on quickly,\u201d Schumer said.",

      "Almost three dozen high-rise condos and luxury hotels are sinking or settling along South Florida beaches",
      "SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla. -- Almost three dozen high-rise condos and luxury hotels along the beach in South Florida are sinking or settling in unexpected ways, in some cases because of nearby construction, according to a new study.",
      "The 35 buildings surveyed along an almost 12-mile (19 kilometer) stretch from Miami Beach to Sunny Isles Beach have sunk or settled by 0.8 to 3.1 inches (2 to 8 cm). About half of the buildings are less than a decade old, according to scientists at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The study was published Friday.",
      "\u201cThe discovery of the extent of subsidence hotspots along the South Florida coastline was unexpected,\u201d Farzaneh Aziz Zanjani, the lead author, said in a statement. \u201cThe study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and a deeper understanding of the long-term implications for these structures.\u201d",
      "It's not uncommon for buildings to sink a little during and soon after construction, but the scientists called their discovery surprising because some of the changes took place several years later.",
      "Limestone under the South Florida beach is interspersed with layers of sand, which can shift under the weight of high-rises and as a result of vibrations from foundation construction. Tidal flows and construction projects as far away as 1,050 feet (320 meters) have contributed to settling, the researchers found. The study used satellite images to capture the changes, with settling most noticeable in buildings in Sunny Isles Beach. The scientists said preliminary data also suggests sinking or settling further north, along the beaches of Broward and Palm Beach counties.",
      "The stretch of South Florida communities surveyed included Surfside, where the Champlain Towers South building collapsed in June 2021, killing 98 people. However, that collapse is thought to have been caused by reinforced concrete that deteriorated due to poor maintenance and flawed design.",
      "Still, the Surfside catastrophe highlighted the need to monitor building stability \"especially in coastal areas with corrosive environmental conditions,\u201d the scientists said.",
      "The scientists said they want to further study whether different sections of impacted buildings are sinking at different rates, which could lead to cracks in their walls or utility breaks and lead to long-term damage.",
      "A separate study earlier this year showed buildings in major cities along the Atlantic Coast were sinking. The research from Virginia Tech and the U.S. Geological Survey showed that areas of New York City, Long Island, Baltimore and Virginia Beach were sinking more than the rate of seawater rise."

      "A Pennsylvania jail retaliated against inmates suspected of smoking synthetic marijuana by punishing entire cell blocks \u2014 confiscating legal paperwork, withholding necessities like toilet paper, soap and warm clothing, and cutting power and heat, inmates allege in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday.",
      "Top jail officials waged an escalating, monthlong campaign of collective punishment, imposing \u201cnear-total deprivation\u201d and violating the constitutional rights of people incarcerated at Dauphin County Prison, a 1,000-person lockup outside the state capital of Harrisburg, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cFor DCP to launch this campaign of mass torture is abominable. Their actions violate the Constitution and basic human decency,\u201d said Margo Hu, staff attorney for the Abolitionist Law Center, which is representing the plaintiffs. \u201cPeople in Dauphin County Prison have been advocating against the facility\u2019s depraved conditions for years. It is past time Dauphin County be held responsible for the harm they have been inflicting.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to the Dauphin County Prison Board.",

      "\u201cI believe it is essential to let this process play out fully. If any inappropriate actions occurred, it is important that there are appropriate consequences,\u201d he said.",
      "The abuses described in the lawsuit took place in November and December 2023 in the jail\u2019s restricted housing unit, where inmates are typically held for breaking jail rules and where jail officials believed synthetic drugs were being used.",
      "The jail responded by confiscating inmates\u2019 tablet computers, eliminating their access to religious texts, legal mail and other materials, and shutting off communications with anyone outside the jail, the lawsuit says. Jail officials are accused of seizing personal hygiene products and locking detainees in their cells nearly round-the-clock, permitting only one 15-minute shower every three days. Power and heat were cut, and some inmates sliced open their mattresses to keep warm as temperatures outside dipped below freezing, the suit alleges.",
      "Most of the affected people were pretrial detainees. When one of the inmates, 27-year-old Kani Little, complained about the conditions, a dozen guards in riot gear assaulted him, slamming him to the ground and spraying him with chemical irritant, the lawsuit asserts.",
      "Little and two other plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages on behalf of all detainees kept in the restricted housing unit at any time between Nov. 16 and Dec. 19, 2023. Dauphin County, the warden, the chief deputy warden and other jail officials and guards are named as defendants.",

      "A lawsuit by a group of Palestinians in Gaza and American relatives accuses the State Department of giving Israel a pass when it comes to a U.S. law meant to limit military aid over human rights abuses",
      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department has carved out loopholes for Israel that give the close American ally a pass on U.S. law restricting aid to foreign militaries over human rights abuses, a lawsuit from a group of Palestinians in Gaza and American relatives asserted Tuesday.",
      "Former State Department officials and crafters of the 1997 Leahy law were among those advising and backing the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit details the barriers it accuses the State Department of creating on behalf of Israel to skirt enforcement and asks courts to intervene. That is after campus protests and moves by some lawmakers failed in their goal of limiting U.S. military support to Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza during the war with Hamas.",
      "\u201cIt's really a modest set of goals here: There's a U.S. law. We'd like the federal government to adhere to U.S. law,\u201d said Ahmed Moor, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian American who joined the lawsuit on behalf of cousins, uncles and aunts displaced and killed in the 14-month war.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken has denied that the department has given Israel a pass. \u201cDo we have a double standard? The answer is no,\" he said in April. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller declined to comment Tuesday, deferring to the Justice Department.",
      "Israel says it makes every effort to limit harm to Palestinian civilians in its military operations. The Biden administration has warned Israel to do more to spare civilians in the Gaza war, holding back one known weapons shipment of 2,000-pound bombs.",
      "A State Department report in May concluded there was \u201creasonable\u201d evidence that Israel's use of U.S.-provided weapons in Gaza violated international law that protects civilians but bypassed a decision on limiting arms, saying the war itself made it impossible for U.S. officials to judge for certain. It also declined last month to hold back arms transfers as it had threatened over humanitarian aid to Gaza.",
      "The law bars U.S. military assistance to foreign military units when there is credible evidence of gross human rights abuses.",
      "Charles Blaha, a former State Department official who helped oversee reviews under the Leahy law, argued that enforcing the law for Israel would have prevented much of the harm that civilians in Gaza are suffering.",
      "\u201cThe secretary of state has made all the decisions so far on Israel and the Leahy Law, and every single decision has resulted in those units being eligible\u201d for continued U.S. military support, Blaha said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the way the normal process works.\"",
      "U.S. military support to Israel in the light of Palestinian civilian deaths was a fraught issue in the presidential election. Republicans and many Democrats demanded unwavering military backing to Israel. The Biden administration's refusal to limit support cost Democrats some votes from some Arab and Muslim voters and others.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit is part of a last push on the outgoing Biden administration by Muslim Americans and others to limit U.S. military support to Israel, which is estimated to have reached $17.9 billion in the first year of the war \u2014 over its treatment of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Two former Senate staffers, Tim Reiser and Stephen Rickard, were instrumental in crafting the law named for former Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and said the rising death toll in Gaza warranted the court case.",
      "The nonprofit Democracy for the Arab World Now, an Arab-rights group founded by slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, helped bring the lawsuit for five Palestinians and Palestinian Americans. The plaintiffs include a former Gaza math teacher and humanitarian worker now living in a tent after losing 20 family members and being uprooted seven times.",
      "Hamas militants began the war with an Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, some of whom are still being held. The Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its death tolls, said the war has killed 45,000 Palestinians.",
      "The lawsuit was filed under the Administrative Procedures Act. Groups ranging from immigration advocates, Medicare groups, petroleum giants and fishermen have used the law in the past to try to shape how U.S. public agencies enforce laws.",
      "It accuses State Department officials under President Joe Biden of creating a series of high barriers when vetting Israel's military for Leahy law violations. Former State officials, including Blaha, have accused the U.S. of effectively exempting Israel from enforcement, and the lawsuit offers some details for the first time.",
      "It claims obstacles include setting up a multimember committee from the State and Defense departments in 2020 solely to consider possible violations by the Israeli military and uniquely requiring the deputy secretary of state to sign off on any findings of violations.",
      "The process also carves out an additional loophole for Israel, the lawsuit says, giving its government alone a chance to stave off a restriction of military support over a human rights abuses by showing it has addressed the problem.",

      "They say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in state pension age to bring them into line with men.",
      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but has rejected any kind of financial payouts.",
      "Nine months ago, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between \u00a31,000 and \u00a32,950 to each of those affected.",
      "The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaign described the government's decision as an \"insult\".",
      "\"The government has today made an unprecedented political choice to ignore the clear recommendations of an independent watchdog,\" said Angela Madden, who chairs the campaign group.",
      "\"This is a bizarre and totally unjustified move which will leave everyone asking what the point of an ombudsman is if ministers can simply ignore their decisions.\"",
      "The Waspi campaign had called for payments of at least \u00a310,000 each.",
      "But Kendall said there was evidence that there was \"considerable awareness\" of the changes to the pension age, and sending letters earlier would not have made a difference to their ability to make retirement choices.",
      "She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision.",
      "\"Given the vast majority of women knew the state pension age was increasing, the government does not believe paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to \u00a310.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers,\" she said.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the concern of the Waspi women, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\".",
      "How the saga unfolded",
      "The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.",
      "But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.",
      "Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.",
      "But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.",
      "The increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",
      "Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",
      "What is the row over women's state pension?",
      "While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it.",
      "The work and pensions secretary said lessons would be learnt from what had happened. The government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age.",
      "She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"Today is a day of shame for the government [which] has turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own, ignoring the independent ombudsman's recommendations, and that is frankly disgraceful.\"",
      "For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts.",
      "A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Change of tack",
      "The Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power.",
      "Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website.",
      "The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: \"The government's decision not to accept our recommendations in full is disappointing and will have been hard for the women to hear.\"",
      "Others had not lived long enough to hear a belated apology, she added.",
      "Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said women \"are right to feel aggrieved.\"",

      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

    "summary": "The \u00a33.6bn deal by Daniel Kretinsky is cleared after agreeing \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
    "story": [
      "The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been cleared by the government.",
      "The \u00a33.6bn takeover by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government will retain a so-called \"golden share\" that will require it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, HQ location and tax residency.",
      "EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday.",
      "The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes - \"for as long as I am alive\".",
      "The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to \u00a3300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\".",
      "The regulator said in September that it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year.",
      "Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at \u00a35.3bn.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover \"will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers\".",
      "Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings.",
      "He added, that EP Group had a \"mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers\".",
      "The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run.",
      "Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an \"extensive agreement\" and the deal was the \"best opportunity\" to save the future of Royal Mail.",
      "However, he added that the union had \"not agreed anything\" on USO reform and there was \"a long way to go\" before that happened.",
      "IDS also owns a highly profitable European parcels business called GLS which made over \u00a3300m last year. This offset losses at Royal Mail, allowing IDS to report a small profit.",
      "By bringing GLS parcel know-how to the UK market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, Mr Kretinsky hopes to build a pan-European logistics business.",
      "The hope is that this will enable Royal Mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business.",
      "Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of \u00a36bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.",
      "In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU.",
      "Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure.",
      "But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago.",
      "Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses.",
      "The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels.",
      "Last week, Royal Mail was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "Ofcom's Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account.",
      "Jenny Hall, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, told the BBC the company was investing to improve performance, but it was \"really important\" the USO was reformed to reflect consumer trends.",
      "She added that Royal Mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do \"need to reflect the realities of delivering the service\".",
      "The price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by Ofcom, with the amount Royal Mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation.",
      "However, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in October Royal Mail pushed the price for first-class mail up by 30p to \u00a31.65, citing \"very real and urgent\" financial challenges for the move.",

    "summary": "Masayoshi Son said he would invest $100bn in the US, and others could follow during Trump's second term.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump pitching the US as a great place for business,  firms around the world are figuring out how to answer his call.",
      "Japanese tech billionaire Masayoshi Son, a colourful character known as much for his major flops as his big accomplishments, presented one path on Monday, appearing with Trump at a press conference and pledging to invest $100bn (\u00a379bn) over four years and create 100,000 jobs.",
      "\"He's a great negotiator,\" the CEO said, laughing on stage as Trump pressed him to double his commitment.",
      "But plenty of questions remain about Mr Son's venture, especially in light of the lack of details he provided and the record of similar investments during Trump's first term.",
      "Mr Son has previously discussed the opportunity he sees in artificial intelligence, and Bloomberg reported in February that he was planning a $100bn chip venture.",
      "But his Softbank Group had only about a third of that, $30bn, in cash earlier this year and its global reputation has taken large hits after previous bets, such as a major investment in co-working firm WeWork, imploded.",
      "With the cameras rolling at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Son avoided giving specifics about how he would fund his promise.",
      "Nor did Trump demand details, casting the pledge primarily as a sign of a wider renewal in business optimism, which has been reported in surveys in recent weeks.",
      "\"This historic investment is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America's future,\" the president-elect said.",
      "Trump has indicated that when he returns to the White House he plans to use the bully pulpit to court foreign investment.",
      "His campaign promises to slash both taxes and regulations have already boosted Wall Street and charged up big business to pursue large-scale ambitions.",
      "Specifically, Trump has said he would cut taxes for companies that make products in the US and speed approvals for firms investing $1bn or more.",
      "Investors expect him to green-light takeovers and pull back on enforcing antitrust laws, as well.",
      "Still, there are concerns about Trump's campaign promises to crack down on immigration, which could affect the workforce, and raise tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. On top of that, he has discussed rolling back manufacturing and energy incentives put in place by President Joe Biden, which some investors like.",
      "Political leaders from both parties often promote business investments and will often take some credit when those ventures boom. President Joe Biden, for example, visited projects by companies such as chipmaker TSMC to highlight historic incentives the government approved for green energy and high-tech firms.",
      "Monday's event recalled pageantry familiar from Trump's first term in office, which was punctuated by high-profile announcements of investments. Many of those planned projects had been in the works already or were hazy in their chances of becoming reality.",
      "Those included Taiwanese semiconductor giant Foxconn's plans to build up a technology park in Wisconsin, which Trump had boasted would become the \"eighth wonder of the world\". Instead of creating more than 13,000 jobs and spending more than $10bn, the company created less than 1,000 jobs and spent around $1bn, according to CNBC.",
      "Trump had also said he would save a failed car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, with an electric vehicle start-up backed by Foxconn and had celebrated promises to create a million jobs over five years made by Alibaba's Jack Ma.",
      "The car company - Lordstown Motors - filed for bankruptcy and reorganized to become Nu Ride Inc earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, Alibaba has said it \"supported\" 403,000 US jobs in 2022, five years after Mr Ma made his promise.",
      "Mr Son's relationship with Trump also dates back to his first election.",
      "Shortly after Trump took the White House, the two men appeared together to discuss $50bn Mr Son planned to invest in the US, as his firm was evolving into a kind of technology venture-capital firm.",
      "Its current holdings include US telecom firm T-Mobile and UK microchip designer Arm."

      "When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost \u00a331.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of \u00a332.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased.",

      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",

      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",

      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",

      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",

      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",

      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",

      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",

      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",

      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",

      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",

      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",

      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

      "'Work together'",
      "Phillipson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government wanted \"everyone pulling together to keep children safe\".",
      "The unique identifier would enable information held by different services, such as health and education, to be shared between them - to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks, the education secretary said.",
      "\"It's about police, schools, children's social care.\"",
      "\"The measures today will require those agencies to work together much more effectively to keep children safe.\"",

      "\"[The register] must be combined with powers for councils to meet face-to-face with children, which is vital to allow councils to ensure children are receiving a suitable education in a safe environment,\" said councillor Arooj Shah, chair of the Children and Young People Board.",
      "But not everyone agrees with plans for a register.",
      "\"International research is clear that introducing registers for home-educated children makes no positive difference whatsoever to those children's outcomes, and leads to fewer being known to public bodies,\" Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, told the BBC.",
      "\"Promises of support have been made for about fifteen years now and have yet to materialise.",
      "\"Over 100,000 children are already registered with local authorities as home-educated, new legislation is not needed to offer those families requested support,\" she added.",

      "So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school.",
      "They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year.",
      "Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case.",
      "But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.",
      "In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health.",
      "This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase.",
      "Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\"",

      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

      "\"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says.",
      "He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.",
      "\"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\"",
      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",

      "Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.",
      "Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.",

      "Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young.",
      "There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.",
      "And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.",
      "\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says.",
      "\"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.",
      "\"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\"",
      "Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.",

      "That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "\"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.",

      "\"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says.",

      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",
      "He worked with banjo maestro B\u00e9la Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

      "Selling 205,000 copies, the song helped the trio top the BBC's Sound Of 2023 poll (beating Fred Again into second place) and become the first girl group to win the Brits' Rising Star prize.",
      "Hot on the heels of those accolades, they scored their first Top 40 hit with Fly Girl \u2013 featuring a rare guest spot from the elusive Missy Elliot.",
      "Then... silence.",
      "The band's debut album Access All Areas was originally slated to drop last year, but it kept getting pushed back. Usually, that means trouble behind the scenes. Internal squabbles, personnel issues, record label skullduggery.",
      "But Jorja Douglas, Ren\u00e9e Downer and Stella Quaresma dismiss those clich\u00e9s.",
      "Instead, they say they were laser-focused on making the best album possible, even if it meant keeping fans waiting.",
      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",
      "On the album track, I'm Just A Girl, Flo address that situation over a dark, electronic beat.",
      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",
      "\"It shows us the trajectory,\" says Downer. \"Obviously, we're not going to be doing anything like Renaissance for years \u2013 but it's nice to start envisioning the road map of our live shows.\"",
      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"It's not just core strength,\" Downer adds. \"It's thighs, it's legs, it's arms.\"",
      "\"Maybe, for the next tour, we should just get mechanical bulls instead of treadmills.\"",
      "Watch this space."

    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",

      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",
      "\"The film doesn't claim to understand Dylan, and suggests Dylan might not understand himself, either. That title, it seems, is literal.\"",

      "He added that: \"Ideas from the suffragettes, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were also received equally horrifically... so we have to be humble that an idea that may be important may trigger us, but it can't be censored.\"",
      "In response to our investigation, Dr Malhotra told the BBC he \"completely accept[s] that there are still some people who disagree with [his views]\" and said that \"does not mean that they have been debunked\".",

      "Finding a cure would become the 57-year-old's latest challenge.",
      "\"[Dartitis is] in the absence of any physical trauma, it's purely psychological,\" said Dr Linda Duffy, professor of psychology at Middlesex University.",
      "From 1982 to 1987 she was ranked women's world number one and also experienced dartitis.",

      "Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall apologised for a 28-month delay in sending letters, but has rejected any kind of financial payouts.",

      "She also said that there was no evidence of \"direct financial loss\" resulting from the government's decision.",
      "\"Given the vast majority of women knew the state pension age was increasing, the government does not believe paying a flat rate to all women at a cost of up to \u00a310.5bn would be fair or proportionate to taxpayers,\" she said.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he understood the concern of the Waspi women, but had to take into account whether it was right \"to impose a further burden on the taxpayer\".",
      "How the saga unfolded",
      "The age at which people receive the state pension has been increasing as people live longer, and currently stands at 66 for men and women.",
      "But for decades, men had received their state pension at 65 and women at the age of 60.",
      "Under the 1995 Pensions Act a timetable was drawn up to equalise the age at which men and women could draw their state pension. The plan was to raise the qualifying age for women to 65 and to phase in that change from 2010 to 2020.",
      "But the coalition government of 2010 decided to speed that up. Under the 2011 Pensions Act the new qualifying age of 65 for women was brought forward to 2018.",
      "The increases have been controversial. Campaigners claim women born in the 1950s have been treated unfairly by the rapid changes and the way they were communicated to those affected.",
      "Many thousands said they had no idea they would have to wait longer to receive their state pension, and had suffered financial and emotional distress as a result.",
      "What is the row over women's state pension?",
      "While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it.",
      "The work and pensions secretary said lessons would be learnt from what had happened. The government would develop an action plan to fix problems identified in the ombudsman's report, and set a clear notice of any future changes to the state pension age.",
      "She said that future pension communications would also use \"the most up to date methods\" to contact those affected.",
      "Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"Today is a day of shame for the government [which] has turned its back on millions of pension-age women who were wronged through no fault of their own, ignoring the independent ombudsman's recommendations, and that is frankly disgraceful.\"",
      "For the Conservatives, who did not respond to the ombudsman's report when in power, shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately said ministers must \"own\" the decision not to give payouts.",
      "A petition to Parliament for a compensation system to be introduced had reached 135,000 signatures before Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Change of tack",
      "The Waspi campaign and others have highlighted previous comments made by the the prime minister, as well as Kendall, before they came to power.",
      "Both spoke of the \"injustice\" that the women faced, with such a post from 2019 still on the latter's website.",
      "The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath, said: \"The government's decision not to accept our recommendations in full is disappointing and will have been hard for the women to hear.\"",
      "Others had not lived long enough to hear a belated apology, she added.",
      "Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said women \"are right to feel aggrieved.\"",
      "\"The fact that many of the women affected will also be coping with the loss of their Winter Fuel Payment this year will intensify their sense of injustice,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Navin Ramgoolam says the original agreement did not benefit his nation enough.",
    "story": [
      "Mauritius says it has submitted changes to a proposed deal over the future of the Chagos Islands, with the country's new PM saying the original agreement did not benefit his country enough.",
      "Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease over Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.",
      "It was finalised shortly before an election which then-Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth lost in a landslide defeat.",
      "His successor Navin Ramgoolam has since said he had reservations about the deal, which has also attracted criticism from the opposition Conservative party in the UK and officials in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Jugnauth called it a \"seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law\".",
      "The British government has said that it also \"protects the long term secure operation of [the military] base\".",
      "Soon after coming into office last month, however, Ramgoolam asked legal experts to review the terms of the deal.",
      "Speaking in the Mauritian parliament on Tuesday, Ramgoolam said that his government had submitted counter-proposals aimed at ensuring that the final agreement aligned with the nation's interests.",
      "\"During the discussions, Mauritius made clear that while it is still willing to conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom, the draft agreement which was shown to us after the general elections is one which, in our view, would not produce the benefits that the nation could expect from such an agreement,\" Ramgoolam told MPs.",
      "He did not spell what the counter-proposals were or the exact nature of the objections.",
      "Ramgoolam confirmed that the UK's response to these proposals was received on Monday and is currently under review.",
      "A delegation of senior officials from the UK, led by Harriet Mathews, director general for Africa, the Americas, and Overseas Territories at the Foreign Office, visited Mauritius last week.",
      "Accompanied by British High Commissioner Charlotte Pierre, she met Ramgoolam on 11 December to further the negotiations.",
      "\"We remain confident the agreement is in both sides interests and will continue to work with the new Mauritius government to finalise the deal. We've always said we'll engage with the new administration in order to finalise the deal,\" Sir Keir's spokesperson said, adding that there was no timeline on the deal.",
      "The only hint at what might be the issue from the Mauritian side are comments made last month by Arvin Boolell, the minister of agro-industry and fisheries.",
      "He criticised the former prime minister for granting the UK a long lease over Diego Garcia - he said it was 200 years, though the publicised timeframe was an initial period of 99 years.",
      "\"In other words,\" Boolell remarked to a newspaper, \"the tenant has become the owner of Diego Garcia for 200 years.\"",
      "In the UK meanwhile, the opposition Conservative party said on Tuesday that the terms of the proposed deal were \"disadvantageous to the United Kingdom\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir, the shadow defence and foreign secretaries said they had \"grave concerns about your Government's plan to surrender sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory - and to pay for the privilege of doing so\".",
      "\"Our view remains that the legal justification you have used for giving away sovereignty is flawed, and it is therefore no surprise that the terms reached are so disadvantageous to the United Kingdom,\" James Cartlidge and Priti Patel said.",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\".",
      "The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "At the time, the British government had already negotiated a secret deal with the US, agreeing to lease it the largest atoll, Diego Garcia, for use as a military base.",
      "Britain later apologised for forcibly removing more than 1,000 islanders from the entire archipelago and promised to hand the islands to Mauritius when they were no longer needed for strategic purposes.",
      "Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.",

      "In a written statement, Home Office Minister Diana Johnson said the provisional settlement \"strikes the balance between protecting taxpayers and providing funding for police forces\".",

      "\"So those who can't raise as much on council tax, which is usually but not in totality the inner city areas - Cleveland, Merseyside, Manchester, West Midlands - don't have that housing stock that pays big money.\"",

      "The police funding settlement also includes \u00a3100m to begin recruiting the 13,000 additional neighbourhood police the Labour government promised to deliver.",
      "The total amount going to policing - including the money for local forces - will be \u00a319.5bn, a real terms increase of 3% on the previous year.",
      "Johnson also said she would change the rules to increase firearms licensing fees, when \"parliamentary time allows\". Currently, in order to own a firearm or shotgun, you need to pay a fee to get a firearms certificate.",
      "Of the additional \u00a3986.9m going to local police forces, \u00a3657.1m is made up of an increase in government grants.",
      "The remaining \u00a3329.8m is expected to be raised by council tax increases.",

      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",
      "It acknowledged that regulator Ofwat had now taken steps to change the way it implemented the law. The government and the Environment Agency are carefully \"considering the allegations\" but failure to accept them could result in legal action.",

      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",

    "summary": "The deputy prime minister says giving local leaders more powers will help drive economic growth.",
    "story": [
      "Angela Rayner has said she wants every region of England to get a mayor, as she outlined plans for a major redesign of local government.",
      "The deputy prime minister told the BBC giving regional mayors more powers over housing, transport, education and employment would help drive economic growth.",
      "Under the proposals, the government also wants to merge areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services.",
      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "In a speech announcing the plans, Rayner said devolution would be the \"default\" rather than \"at the whim of a minister in Whitehall\".",
      "She described the UK as the \"most centralised\" country in Europe and pledged to end \"micromanaging by central government\".",
      "Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans but where they are unable to agree on a way forward, ministers would get the power in law to \"knock heads together\" and create larger authorities.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, the deputy PM said these larger groupings were better placed to scale up and tackle issues which crossed different areas.",
      "The government will announce the parts of the country it is prioritising for devolution \"in due course\", with the aim of holding mayoral elections for these areas in May 2026.",

      "giving local groups the right to buy under-threat community assets such as youth clubs, pubs, libraries and sports facilities",
      "Local government in England is currently covered by a complicated patchwork of arrangements that has changed a lot in recent years.",
      "In some places, responsibility for local services is shared between county councils, which manage areas including social care and education; and district councils, which cover smaller areas and are responsible for services such as bin collections.",
      "Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing.",
      "The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030.",
      "Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal.",
      "The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more homes.",
      "It has now outlined its ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals.",
      "Ministers see streamlining local government as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, in an attempt to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment.",
      "Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two\u00a0or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport.",
      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and amount to arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",
      "She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\".",
      "The Conservatives said Rayner's announcement was part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.",
      "However, the proposals have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\".",
      "Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".",
      "She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\".",
      "Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals: Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 20:25:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The foreign secretary's remarks come as the government announced \u00a350m of humanitarian aid for Syrians.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has said the British government has had \"diplomatic contact\" with the Syrian rebel group that toppled the Assad regime.",
      "Lammy said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) remains a proscribed terrorist organisation, but the UK \"can have diplomatic contact and so we do have diplomatic contact, as you would expect\".",
      "His US counterpart Antony Blinken said on Saturday that the US had made \"direct contact\" with the HTS rebels now in control of Syria.",
      "Lammy's remarks come as the government announced a \u00a350m humanitarian aid package for vulnerable Syrians, including refugees in the region.",
      "Speaking on Sunday, Lammy said: \"We want to see a representative government, an inclusive government. We want to see chemical weapons stockpiles secured, and not used, and we want to ensure that there is not continuing violence.",
      "\"For all of those reasons, using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and of course intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.\"",
      "The diplomatic contact with HTS does not mean the foreign secretary has personally been in touch with the rebel group.",
      "Whitehall sources say the contact referred to is permitted under the terms of existing terrorism legislation, under which, for example, NGOs would be able to have contact in order to provide humanitarian assistance.",
      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",
      "Both the UK and the US have a vested interest in what happens next in Syria. Blinken told reporters on Saturday that the US interaction with HTS was in particular over the fate of the missing American journalist, Austin Tice.",
      "The US State Department said Blinken and Lammy spoke on Sunday, as the secretary of state told the foreign secretary Washington will back \"an accountable and representative\" government in Syria, \"chosen by the Syrian people\".",
      "Asked whether HTS could be removed from the UK's list of proscribed terror groups, Lammy said the rebel group remains a proscribed organisation that came out of al-Qaeda.",
      "\"Al-Qaeda is responsible for a tremendous loss of life on British soil,\" Lammy said, adding: \"We will judge them [HTS] on their actions, I won't comment on future proscription but of course we recognise that this is an important moment for Syria.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said no decision had been made yet on HTS's proscription status.",
      "On the cash pledge to the Middle Eastern country, Lammy said it followed talks on Saturday in Aqaba.",
      "Hosted by Jordan, delegates from several countries agreed on the importance of a \"non-sectarian and representative government\", protecting human rights, unfettered access for humanitarian aid, the safe destruction of chemical weapons and combatting terrorism.",
      "The talks were attended by the UK, US, France, Germany, the Arab Contact Group, Bahrain, Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the EU and UN.",
      "HTS was not present at the meeting in Jordan.",
      "However, everybody in Aqaba felt it was important to engage with HTS, and that engagement should be on the basis of humanitarian access and the principles outlined above.",
      "The UK said \u00a330m will be channelled within Syria for food, shelter and emergency healthcare, while \u00a310m will go to the World Food Programme (WFP) in Lebanon and \u00a310m to WFP and the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, in Jordan.",
      "As well as the \u00a350m in aid for Syrians in the region, the UK government said \u00a3120,000 of UK funding will be given to support the Organisation of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) \"to rid Syria of chemical weapons\" and support the interim Syrian government.",
      "The UK closed its embassy in Damascus in 2013, two years after the Arab Spring protests began to be brutally suppressed there by the Assad regime.",
      "Between 2011 and 2021, more than 30,000 Syrians were granted asylum in the UK, but on Monday the Home Office said it was no longer possible to assess outstanding cases given the change in circumstances.",
      "Last week, the HTS rebel group toppled Assad's rule alongside allied rebel factions.",
      "The Home Office later paused its decisions on Syrian asylum claims to the UK as the government has not determined whether Syria, under the new rebel-led authorities, is a safe country which people could be sent to.",
      "The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years. In 2011, Bashar al-Assad crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.",
      "More reports are now emerging of the cruelty of Assad's regime and the suffering it inflicted on the lives of so many Syrians.",
      "However, given the Islamist militant group's previous affiliations with al-Qaeda, religious minorities in Syria and neighbouring countries worry about their future under HTS's rule.",

      "The MP - who will ask an urgent question in the Commons later on China's influence - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the alleged spy could be \"the tip of the iceberg\" of those in the UK doing the same job.",
      "Known only as H6 due to a court order protecting his identity, the businessman was banned last week by the UK's semi-secret national security court, which heard he had formed an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the Duke of York.",
      "A hearing over his anonymity is set to take place at the Royal Courts of Justice at 14:00 GMT.",
      "Also on Monday, Sir Iain is expected to ask Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, if she will make a statement on the \"extent of United Front Work Department operations within the UK\".",
      "The United Front Work Department is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which H6 is believed to have been associated with. The department is tasked with conducting influence operations.",
      "Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was \"concerned about the challenge that China poses\".",
      "\"In relation to any discussions with Buckingham Palace there's a long-standing convention in the United Kingdom that that's never spoken about,\" he added in response to questions on H6's close ties to Prince Andrew.",
      "Other politicians have also shown concern over the reach of the United Front Work Department.",
      "Former security minister Tom Tugendhat said it showed the \"the level of threat\" posed by China to the UK.",
      "\"They're trying to change the policies of the UK and other countries around the world,\" he said.",

      "Questions over Prince Andrew's judgement and finances raised again",
      "Talking to BBC Breakfast, Tugendhat said it was a way for the CCP to \"exert influence\" within the UK.",
      "Last week, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he had \"ceased all contact\" with the Chinese businessman, with all meetings having been \"through official channels\" and \"nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed\".",
      "H6 was invited to the prince's birthday party in 2020 and was told he could act on his behalf when dealing with potential investors in China.",
      "In a letter found on one of H6's confiscated devices, the Chinese businessman was told by one of Prince Andrew's advisors: \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\"",
      "It is not clear how H6 became close to Prince Andrew.",
      "The alleged targeting by an alleged Chinese influence operation is the latest controversy for Prince Andrew, who is no longer a working royal.",
      "It followed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances this autumn, when King Charles withdrew his financial support for Prince Andrew and the costs of running Royal Lodge in Windsor, with a security bill costing several million pounds per year.",
      "Following this latest controversy there have been reports that Prince Andrew is being encouraged to keep a low profile over the Christmas season.",
      "He would usually be part of the Royal Family's Christmas Day appearance at church in Sandringham and at another Christmas Royal gathering this week and there have been suggestions he will be advised to keep out of public sight and not attract any more attention.",
      "The concerns are that Prince Andrew would become the talking point and overshadow such events, so he might be urged to voluntarily reduce his public visibility over Christmas.",
      "Prince Andrew still attends family events and ceremonial occasions, but not always the public moments. For instance, he has attended the annual Order of the Garter ceremony, without taking part in the public procession.",

      "The BBC has contacted Prince Andrew for a response.",
      "'Many more involved in this espionage'",

      "In March 2023, H6 was banned entry into the UK by the then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman.",
      "He then brought his case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a court set up to consider appeals against decisions to ban or remove someone from the country on national security or related grounds. In the published ruling, external, the judges upheld Braverman's decision.",
      "H6 has met with many senior figures in the UK, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and Prince Andrew, to whom he was described as a \"close confidant\".",
      "But Sir Iain, who led the Conservative party 2001-2003, said the bigger issue of H6 and Prince Andrew is how China's well-funded attempts to make contact with influential individuals has been happening in \"plain view\".",
      "\"The reality is that there are many many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that's taking place.\"",
      "H6 is not allowed to be named under an anonymity order imposed by the courts last week, which Sir Iain called ridiculous.",
      "It is believed that some MPs may use parliamentary privilege to name the Chinese businessman. Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers unrestricted free speech within the chambers, and allows them to name people without the fear of being dragged before the courts and sued for defamation.",
      "But others, including Jim McMahon, the minister of housing, communities and local government, believe the naming of H6 is a \"matter for the courts\".",

      "Asked about the scheme during a press conference in Norway, the prime minister said: \"We've been working on it from day one in government, and there will be an update coming shortly, so you'll have more information in relation to that.\"",

      "Last month, Sir Keir emphasised the importance of a \"strong UK-China relationship\" during the first in-person meeting between a UK prime minister and Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018.",
      "But a Home Office source told the Guardian newspaper that the previous government did not leave the scheme in a fit state to enact, which Sir Iain responded to and said there was \"nothing wrong\" with.",

    "story": [
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has told the BBC the level of \"dangerous\" small boat Channel crossings is \"far too high\" but she refused to set out a timetable to reduce the number.",
      "More than 20,000 people have made the crossing to the UK since Labour took power, up on 17,020 during the same period last year.",

      "Also speaking to Kuenssberg, shadow home secretary Chris Philp said his party would seek to put in place a \"deterrent-style scheme\" if it returned to power.",
      "The number of migrants crossing the Channel in Labour's first five months in office is down on the same period in 2022, a record year for arrivals, but similar to the number who crossed in that period in 2021.",
      "Cooper said the number of crossings was still \"deeply damaging\" and \"dangerous\", and was undermining border security as well as putting lives at risk.",
      "\"Of course we want to continue to progress, of course we want to see the boat crossings come down as rapidly as possible.",
      "\"What we are not going to do is deal with this by slogans. Rishi Sunak said he'd stop the boats in a year.\"",

      "\"We've made clear that border security is actually one of the foundational issues\".",

      "The department said the number of enforced returns was up compared to the same period last year, arguing greater collaboration with other countries had made more return flights possible.",
      "Philp argued the uptick in returns was the continuation of a \"trend\" which had started before this year's election.",

      "That five-year agreement has faced significant challenges, with transfers recently halted by a court in Rome.",
      "Asked whether Labour would also consider processing asylum claims offshore, Cooper said the government would \"look at whatever works\" but emphasised that any such scheme would need to be \"effective\".",
      "She also blamed an increase in hotel places for asylum seekers since the election on a \"collapse in decision-making\" ahead of the vote, which she argued had left Labour with a \"soaring backlog\" of cases on entering office.",
      "Speaking on Sky News, Home Office minister Angela Eagle defended the lack of an official timetable for reducing crossings, adding that the public wanted to see \"steady progress\" rather than a \"date snatched out of the air\".",

      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",

      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",

      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",

      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",

      "Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show 73,105 trials were unheard at the end of September, almost double the number in 2019.",
      "Sir Brian's report, due next year, will consider the creation of intermediate courts, where cases could be heard by a judge flanked by magistrates, to reduce the backlog.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the announcement of the review, Sir Brian said the number of prosecutions waiting to be dealt with was \"unsustainable\" - with listings now running into 2027.",
      "\"This isn't so much a challenge,\" he told the BBC, \"it's a crisis in the criminal justice system which has to be addressed\".",
      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",
      "\"The extent to which we can divert people from the criminal justice system is a live one and that's one of the areas I will be looking at,\" he said, adding intermediate courts currently do not exist, \"so you're either in the magistrates' court or you're in a Crown Court.\"",

      "\"We owe it to victims to find bold, innovative approaches that will speed up justice,\" she said, adding criminals should know \"they will quickly face the consequence of their actions.\"",
      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",
      "Fuelled by a surge of online misinformation, the riots saw buildings including mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers vandalised and dozens of police officers injured.",
      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",

      "Lord Dholakia was in the car but did not initially hear the comments. Others on the committee confronted her over the remarks, including Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the report heard.",

      "He told MPs new housing targets for local councils were focused on parts of the country where housing was least affordable - and it was \"wrong\" to say rural areas would bear the brunt of the changes.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made increasing housebuilding a key priority, promising 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "\"Our plan for change will put builders not blockers first, overhaul the broken planning system and put roofs over the heads of working families and drive the growth that will put more money in people's pockets,\" said the PM.",
      "However, councils, including some Labour-run authorities, have previously raised concerns higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve.",
      "They point to strains on local infrastructure, land shortages and a lack of capacity in the construction industry as among the constraints on housebuilding.",
      "The government has said councils must meet their housing targets and that, if they refuse to put a local plan in place to do this, ministers will intervene and in extreme cases could take over plans themselves.",
      "Housing campaigners have welcomed the policy, saying it is vital for addressing the shortage of homes.",
      "Eve McQuillan, who is 31 and lives in east London, is one of the millions of people across the country trying to get on the housing ladder.",
      "\"If you have a job\u2026 you should be able to afford a decent place to live,\" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme.",

      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, also welcomed the changes to the planning system.",

      "Woman with \u00a350,000 savings still can't buy a house",
      "Under the updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "However, Pennycook told the House of Commons brownfield land alone would not be enough to deliver the number of homes the country needed.",
      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building on green belt land, which is higher quality, will be allowed if other options have been exhausted - but it must comply with a set of \"golden rules,\" the government said.",
      "Developers will need to prioritise necessary infrastructure, such as nurseries and GP surgeries, as well as guarantee affordable housing and access to green spaces.",
      "It is still not clear what will count as grey belt land.",
      "The government has previously given disused petrol stations and car parks as examples.",
      "It gave some further explanation in the document, such as land that does not preserve the character of historic towns - but councils will have to wait until the new year for full guidance.",
      "Pennycook said the government had listened to feedback from councils who wanted housing to be better targeted at areas where affordability pressures were most acute.",
      "London, the south-east and east of England now have higher housing targets than those proposed by the government in July, while the targets for other regions are lower.",
      "However, Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"This planning framework pushes development to rural areas, concreting over green belt, green fields and over our green and pleasant land, rather than focusing on supporting building in urban areas, where we need to build the most.\"",
      "He added that it was \"vital\" homes were built in the right places with the right infrastructure and the government would \"bulldoze through the concerns of local communities\".",
      "Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said there was a danger the environment could suffer from plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be \"a colossal, historic missed opportunity\" to build new homes \"in a way that destroys nature, rather than at the same time, restores and rebuilds our natural infrastructure\".",
      "Overall, councils are being told they must reach a combined target of 370,000 new homes a year \u2013 although the government has not set a date for when this will be achieved.",
      "There is an expectation that not all the homes planned for by this target will be delivered within five years.",
      "The government has also promised \u00a3100m of extra funds for councils and 300 additional planning officers to speed up decision-making processes.",
      "It said local authorities would have 12 weeks to come up with timetables for new housebuilding plans or risk intervention from ministers.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said tackling local housing challenges would require a \"collaborative approach\" between councils and the government.",
      "Councils and communities who know their local areas well are \"best placed to make judgement decisions on how to manage competing demand for land,\" LGA spokesman Adam Hug said."

    "story": [
      "The deputy prime minister has announced plans for the biggest reorganisation of local government in England in over 50 years.",
      "Angela Rayner wants to give everyone a directly elected mayor, and incorporate district councils into wider authorities.",
      "She hailed the proposals as a \"turning point when we finally see communities, people and places across England begin to take back control over the things that matter to them\", to an audience of regional mayors, local government and business leaders.",
      "But what difference could it make to your local area?",
      "Bins, libraries, parks \u2013 all delivered by one council",
      "Local government across England is often referred to as a patchwork.",
      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",
      "Half of the population of England currently have an elected mayor, with research suggesting they're well known locally.",
      "Polling from the non-partisan think tank the Centre for Cities suggests that mayors are the most recognisable local political figures in their area, with three-quarters of people knowing who they are - way ahead of MPs or council leaders.",
      "Powers over local economies \u2013 and more money from Whitehall",
      "Mayors will have to come up with local growth plans for their areas to help kickstart the economy.",
      "They'll have to work with major employers, universities, colleges and industry bodies in their areas, identifying sectors for growth in the region.",
      "Local leaders will then need to put in place the conditions for growth, like college courses and Jobcentre support that match local skills gaps. The hope is all of this will create jobs, with the government saying that local leaders have a better understanding of the strengths and ambitions of an area than Whitehall.",
      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",
      "And in West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin is bringing buses back under her control, with plans to build a mass tram system as well.",
      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",
      "Mayors would also have more powers over e-bike schemes under the plans, with the ability to fine users and companies whose cycles were left in a hazardous way.",
      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",
      "The government says it wants to replace this right to bid with a right to buy, with funding available to purchase community assets.",

      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'",

      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",

      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",

      "\"The starting point is local plans, and that's really important for councils to develop the plan according to the target, taking into account local need, and working with developers. So that's where it starts,\" he said.",
      "\"But are we going to push it though if those plans don't work? Yes, yes we absolutely are.\"",
      "Responses from local councils to an Freedom of Information request by the BBC suggest the government could be on a collision course with local authorities.",
      "The vast majority of councils expressed concern. Many fear targets have not taken into account strains on local infrastructure, land shortages, and a lack of capacity in the planning system and construction industry.",
      "According to the latest report from the Construction Skills Network, around 225,000 new construction workers are needed across the UK by 2027.",

      "There are just under 700,000 empty and unfurnished homes in England, according to the most recent government figures.",
      "Of those, 261,471 are classed as \"long-term empty,\" meaning no-one has lived there for six months or more.",

    "story": [
      "The government and regulators have broken the law by being too lenient on water companies that spill sewage, the UK's environment watchdog has found.",
      "The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) said sewage releases should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as during unusually heavy rainfall, but that \"this has not always been the case\".",
      "It acknowledged that regulator Ofwat had now taken steps to change the way it implemented the law. The government and the Environment Agency are carefully \"considering the allegations\" but failure to accept them could result in legal action.",
      "Campaigners welcomed the findings but called it a \"bittersweet moment\".",

      "More officers to probe sewage - Environment Agency",
      "\"The OEP's findings offer yet another devastating verdict of the total failure of environmental regulation in our country,\" said chair and founder of River Action Charles Watson. \"It is nothing short of scandalous.\"",
      "Sewage sometimes needs to be released when it is raining to prevent a build-up of wastewater in the system and sewage flowing back into people's homes.",
      "But two years ago the wildlife charity WildFish complained to the OEP that the Conservative government, and the regulators - Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) - were allowing excessive releases. It argued that according to the law sewage should only be released under \"exceptional circumstances\", such as unusually heavy rain, rather than any wet weather.",
      "Untreated sewage contains chemicals which can be harmful to aquatic life and can lead to a build-up of algae which starves local wildlife of oxygen and produces toxins that are potentially fatal to pets and dangerous to people.",
      "And the less rainfall there is to dilute the sewage the more harmful it could potentially be.",
      "Nick Measham, CEO at WildFish, told the BBC following the announcement: \"We are absolutely delighted and relieved. It actually means we can end this problem of sewage going into rivers.",
      "\"But it is a bittersweet moment. It's frustrating when the government and the regulators don't actually do their job in the way you'd hope.\"",
      "The OEP was set up under the 2021 Environment Act to hold the government and other public bodies to account in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "It has acknowledged that Ofwat has now taken steps to change the way it implements the law, and in August Ofwat announced record fines for three water companies.",
      "But the government's environment department, Defra, and the Environment Agency are currently consulting on any changes, and have said they would \"carefully consider\" the OEP's allegations.",
      "A Defra spokesperson said: \"For too long, water companies have pumped record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas. In just five months, this government has acted decisively to refresh outdated guidance to make extremely clear our expectations around storm overflows.\"",
      "On Tuesday Defra also announced that water companies would have to increase compensation for customers facing service failures such as water outages or pollution.",
      "Customers would receive automatic payments of up to \u00a32,000 for water supply outages, sewer flooding or low water pressure.",
      "The announcement follows a public consultation in August.",
      "If Defra and the EA decide to accept the finding in full - which they must do by March - it could result in changes to thousands of environmental permits.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 03:20:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate change could increase flood threats without improvements to defences, the Environment Agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Around eight million properties in England - or one in four - could be at risk of flooding by 2050 as the danger increases due to climate change, the Environment Agency (EA) has said.",
      "In its first assessment of how a warming world could affect flooding, the EA warned of increasing threats from heavier rainfall and rising sea levels.",
      "The number of at-risk properties could be even higher if more houses are built on floodplains, but could be lower if flood defences are improved.",
      "Currently, 6.3 million properties are considered at risk from flooding, new figures show, which is higher than previously thought.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties",
      "\"The frequency and severity of the kind of flood events that we've been experiencing are likely to become more and more challenging,\" Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency, said.",
      "The EA considers flooding from three main sources: rivers, the sea and surface water - where heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage systems.",
      "It defines properties as being \"at risk\" when the yearly chance of flooding is greater than one-in-1,000.",
      "Currently, the EA says that 4.6 million homes and businesses are at risk of surface flooding, with London the most affected region.",
      "This is a 43% rise on its previous estimate, but this is almost entirely due to improved datasets and computer modelling techniques, rather than a real-world increase in flood risk.",
      "However, the EA says that climate change could raise the number of properties at risk of surface flooding to around 6.1 million by the middle of the century.",
      "It is well-documented that a warming world generally increases the intensity of heavy rainfall.",
      "Between October 2023 and March 2024, for example, the amount of rainfall on the stormiest days in the UK increased by an estimated 20% on average due to climate change.",
      "The report also highlights a rising risk of flooding from rivers and the sea - from 2.4 million properties today to around 3.1 million by mid-century.",
      "The East Midlands, Yorkshire and The Humber, and south-east England are particularly at risk.",
      "This type of flooding - from rivers bursting their banks or storm surges bringing seawater onto shore - can be particularly damaging as it often brings deeper floodwaters.",
      "Wetter winters increase the chances of river flooding, while sea-level rise makes coastal flooding more likely.",
      "Global sea levels are rising mainly due to a combination of melting glaciers and ice sheets, and the fact that warmer water takes up more space. They are expected to continue rising for centuries to come.",
      "Average sea levels around the UK have already risen by nearly 20cm since 1900, with most of that occurring since 1990.",
      "This also has knock-on effects for coastal erosion - the displacement of land along coastlines due to the action of waves.",
      "The UK already has some of the fastest eroding coastlines in Europe.",
      "But climate change could increase the number of properties at risk of effectively being lost into the sea to nearly 20,000 by 2100, even if adequate shoreline management plans are put in place, the EA says.",
      "That would be up from 3,500 between now and mid-century.",
      "Preparations for flooding",
      "This report only considers how climate change affects future flood risk.",
      "There are many other factors, from building on floodplains to improvements to flood defences, that could shape the impacts of flooding in the future.",
      "Partly thanks to the Thames Barrier flood defence, for example, London is currently considered less at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea than some other regions.",
      "But there have been repeated warnings that the UK is poorly prepared for the impacts of a changing climate.",
      "Earlier this year, a cross-party committee of MPs warned that the government had not maintained enough of its existing flood defences or built enough new ones. A lack of funding has been a key issue.",
      "In response to today's report, Floods Minister Emma Hardy acknowledged that \"too many communities are exposed to the dangers of flooding\".",

    "summary": "At least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten in a Bronze Age massacre in Somerset.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have uncovered the aftermath of an \"exceptionally violent\" attack about 4,000 years ago in Somerset when at least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten.",
      "It is the largest case of violence between humans identified in early Bronze Age England, which had been considered a peaceful time.",
      "The victims' bones were found by cavers in the 1970s. Experts believe they were thrown into a 15m shaft by the prehistoric attackers.",
      "The massacre was probably driven by a furious \"desire for revenge\" and its effects likely \"echoed through generations\", says Professor Rick Schulting at Oxford university.",
      "He says the victims may have been eaten as a ritual to \"dehumanise\" them and to send a message by \"insulting the remains\".",
      "Around 3,000 fragments of bones found at a cave system called Charterhouse Warren in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, were analysed by a team of archaeologists.",
      "They believe that at least 37 people died, including men, woman and children. Teenagers and older children made up about half of the victims.",
      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",
      "The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity."

    "summary": "A new DNA analysis has shown that the arrival of modern humans from Africa was far from smooth.",
    "story": [
      "Far from triumphantly breezing out of Africa, modern humans went extinct many times before going on to populate the world, new studies have revealed.",
      "The new DNA research has also shed new light on the role our Neanderthal cousins played in our success.",
      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "After months of deadlock, there are new signs that Israel and Hamas could be moving closer to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.",
      "A senior Palestinian official involved in the indirect negotiations told the BBC that  talks were in a \"decisive and final phase\".",
      "Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, has also said an agreement is closer than ever.",
      "In recent weeks, the US, Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts \u2013 reporting greater willingness by both sides in this 14-month war to conclude a deal.",
      "An Israeli delegation described as \"working level\" is currently in the Qatari capital Doha amid a flurry of diplomatic comings and goings in the region.",
      "The Palestinian official outlined a three-phase plan which would see civilians and women soldiers held hostage in Gaza released in the first 45 days, with Israeli forces pulling out of city centres, the coastal road and the strategic strip of land along the border with Egypt.",
      "There would be a mechanism for displaced Gazans to be able to return to the north of the territory, the official said.",
      "A second stage would see remaining hostages freed and troops withdrawn before the third stage ending the war.",
      "Of 96 hostages still held in Gaza, 62 are assumed by Israel to still be alive.",
      "The plan appears to be based on the deal US President Joe Biden outlined on 31 May and reports from all sides stress there are key details to work out.",
      "A round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal.",
      "According to his spokesman, Katz told members of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs committee on Monday: \"We have not been this close to an agreement on the hostages since the previous deal,\" referring to an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israel in November 2023.",

      "\"We will not allow any terrorist activity against Israeli communities and Israeli citizens from Gaza. We will not allow a return to the reality of before 7 October.\"",
      "Such comments are likely to be seen as problematic by negotiators trying to bridge gaps with Hamas.  However, in Israel, they are seen as vital to guarantee the support of far-right Israeli cabinet ministers who have previously warned they would not agree to what they have described as a \"reckless\" deal in Gaza.",
      "The Palestinian Islamist armed group Hamas, which governed Gaza, carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023.  About 1,200 people were killed and 253 others abducted.",
      "More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations.",
      "On 7 December, it is understood from Palestinian sources that Israel stopped aircraft movement and drone surveillance over the territory for six hours at the request of mediators, allowing Hamas to collect information about the hostages.",
      "Pro-Qatari newspaper al-Araby al-Jadeed then reported that Hamas had handed a list of sick and elderly Israeli hostages as well as those with US citizenship to Egyptian intelligence officials. The paper said there were also the names of Palestinian prisoners that the group was demanding as part of the deal.",
      "At the outset of the war in Gaza, Israel pledged to destroy Hamas's governing and military capabilities. More than 45,000 Palestinians have since been killed according to figures from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which are seen as reliable by the UN and others.",
      "Most of the 2.3 million population of Gaza has been displaced, there has been widespread destruction and amid an ongoing struggle to get aid to those in need, there is now mass hunger.",
      "Donald Trump's victory in November's US presidential election has given a new push to diplomatic efforts.",

      "It is striking how elaborate the operation was. Explosives were hidden in an electric scooter and they were detonated by remote control, Ukrainian sources have told the BBC.",
      "The victim, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, is believed be the highest-ranking military official killed beyond the combat zone since its full-scale invasion began.",
      "His assassination has shocked Russia's military and political establishment. Sources from Ukraine's SBU security service let it be known they were behind it.",
      "There have been numerous Ukrainian operations targeting Russia's forces on Ukrainian territory.",
      "But the fact that Ukrainian intelligence can target the head of Russia's military's radiation, biological and chemical protection forces outside his home in south-eastern Moscow raises questions about Russian security and how far Ukraine's capabilities can extend.",
      "Choosing a scooter for the attack was a smart move. They lie abandoned all over the place on Moscow's streets and attract little attention.",
      "But as they detonated the device at precisely the right moment, in this case when Gen Kirillov was leaving his apartment block alongside his aide, the perpetrators must have had some sort of visual surveillance \u2013 either monitoring via camera or watching it in person.",
      "It's thought that his murder was not the SBU's first on the streets of Russia's biggest cities, so earlier attacks on politicians and military officials in Russia can shed some light on how such operations have been carried out.",
      "What verified videos tell us about Igor Kirillov's death",
      "Igor Kirillov: Russia's chemical weapons chief and mouthpiece killed in Moscow",
      "It was in April 2023 that prominent war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was meeting supporters at a cafe in St Petersburg as part of a \"creative evening\".",
      "During the event at Street Food Bar No 1, Darya Trepova, who claimed to be an art student, presented him with a sculpture of a soldier's head.  Minutes later, as Tatarsky was putting the present back into the box, it exploded, killing him and wounding many of the others in the room.",
      "Ms Trepova later went on to claim at her trial that she knew nothing about the explosives inside the bust. She admitted that she was against the war in Ukraine but, she said, she had been told that inside the bust was a microphone.",
      "The court sentenced her to 27 years in prison.",
      "Whatever she knew in advance, there is little doubt that Ukrainian security services use deception to lure local Russians who may perhaps be sympathetic to Ukraine's cause.",
      "Acts can range from organising sabotage to, in this case, priming a bomb.",
      "The SBU is not above sending a hitman to achieve its goal, perhaps the most notorious spy means of assassination.",
      "A year ago, a pro-Russian former Ukrainian MP, Ilya Kyva, was shot dead in a village outside Moscow.  The killer managed to get unnoticed into the grounds of a hotel and shot Mr Kyva twice while he was walking in a park.",
      "Again, Ukraine made no official statements, but sources in the SBU said it was them.",
      "Only five days ago, a leading Russian missile scientist, Mikhail Shatsky, was shot dead in a forest outside Moscow. In that case, the killing was pinned on Ukraine's military intelligence service, although there was no confirmation.",
      "Shatsky was responsible for modernising Russia's Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles that have caused so much destruction and loss of life in Ukraine.",
      "The fact that Kirillov's killing took place within days of Shatsky's murder shows how deep Ukraine's spies have penetrated into Russia.",
      "It is not just politicians or Russians connected to the military who have come under attack.",
      "In August 2022, Darya Dugina was murdered in a car bomb attack, in an apparent message to her father, Aleksander Dugin, regarded as the Russian ideologist justifying Moscow's aggression in Ukraine.",
      "According to the Russian investigation, two Ukrainian citizens were involved in the attack - an apparent example of Ukraine sending operatives deep into Russia to \"eliminate\" their target.",
      "Natalia Vovk, 43, had crossed into Russia from occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. She later teamed up with another Ukrainian who rented a garage where they assembled the bomb. Both Ukrainians, as it was alleged during the trial, had managed to escape from Russia a day before Dugina was killed.",
      "All these attacks show the wide range of methods available to Ukrainian special services, but some experts believe it might not be Kyiv that assassinated Lt Gen Kirillov at all.",
      "It could be the result of an internal power struggle among the Russian military or the Kremlin's attempt to remove one of the main witnesses of war crimes, says Yuriy Karin, a Kyiv-based military observer.",
      "If it was the SBU, then the message is clear, he says.  \"Even within Moscow's ring road, Russian generals cannot feel safe.\""

      "BBC Verify has been analysing social media videos and images from Moscow to try to build up a clearer picture of the blast that killed Russian Lt Gen Igor Kirillov and his assistant.",
      "Ukrainian sources say they carried out the attack on the senior commander, who has overseen Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops since 2017. He was sanctioned by the UK in October and accused of being a \"significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation\".",
      "Lt Gen Kirillov was leaving a modern apartment building in south-east Moscow early on Tuesday when the device hidden in a parked scooter was detonated, Russia's Investigations Committee - the country's equivalent of the FBI - said.",
      "Footage authenticated by BBC Verify shows two people leaving the building before an explosion next to the entrance. Their clothes are the same colour as those on the bodies pictured in the aftermath.",
      "A scooter appears to be propped up near the door. Nothing after the blast is visible, the rest of the footage is obscured by debris from the explosion.",
      "In other footage analysed by BBC Verify, the remains of an electric scooter can be seen lying among debris between two bodies and a demolished doorway.",
      "A close-up image of the scooter, verified by matching it to the debris, shows it is largely intact - apart from its missing handlebars.",
      "Experts at Janes - a private open-source investigations organisation - told BBC Verify that the images suggested that the explosion was caused by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), rather than a conventional munition.",
      "\"From the available pictures of the scooter it actually looks pretty intact, so the effect appears to be more fragmentation than blast,\" a spokesperson with the organisation told BBC Verify.",

      "He added that the attack demonstrated \"a decent level of sophistication and may have taken months of preparation\" which would have required a \"significant amount of surveillance of the intended target prior to the attack\".",
      "Russian media has speculated that a device had been taped to the scooter's handlebars.",
      "It has also reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the explosion was likely detonated remotely. Mr Heathcote agreed with the assessment, suggesting that a radio signal from a phone or car fob may have been the trigger.",
      "\"The attacker will need to have eyes on the device and will press a switch to initiate the explosion as the target comes into range,\" he told BBC Verify. \"The proximity to the device of the attacker depends on the transmitter [or] receiver being used.\"",
      "Russian state media initially said that the bomb used up to 300g of explosive material, before later revising that figure up to 1kg, citing law enforcement data.",
      "An eyewitness has been showing Russian media images of what he said was debris from the explosion that landed in the flat he owns across the street from the site. BBC Verify is showing these to weapons experts to help establish whether they could have come from the device.",
      "According to the developers, the apartment block where Lt Gen Kirillov was killed is relatively new and was completed in 2019. The flats are relatively high end, with some available for around 20m Roubles (\u00a3153,540) online.",
      "In the videos verified by the BBC, a small crowd is seen gathered around the bodies, which are lying in the snow-covered street. Emergency services vehicles are also visible in the footage.",

    "summary": "India's federal government is seeking to bring a controversial bill for holding federal and state assembly elections together.",
    "story": [
      "India, the world's largest democracy, is almost always in election mode.",
      "With 28 states, eight union territories and nearly a billion eligible voters, polls are a constant feature of the nation's political landscape.",
      "For years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has championed the idea of \"One Nation, One Election\" -  a proposal to hold state and federal elections simultaneously every five years.",
      "On Tuesday, the Indian law minister introduced a bill to implement this system in the parliament sparking a debate over power dynamics.",
      "Supporters argue this approach would slash campaign costs, ease the strain on administrative resources and streamline governance.",
      "Former President Ram Nath Kovind, who led a nine-member committee that recommended holding elections at the same time last year, called it a \"game changer\", citing economists who say it could boost India's GDP by up to 1.5%.",
      "Critics, however, warn it could erode India's federal structure, concentrating power in the center and weakening states' autonomy.",
      "What is one nation, one election?",
      "India's democracy operates on multiple levels, each with its own election cycle.",
      "There are general elections to choose parliament members, state elections to pick legislators, while rural and urban councils hold separate votes for local governance. By-elections fill vacancies caused by resignation, death or disqualification of representatives.",
      "These elections happen every five years, but at different times. The government now wants to sync them.",
      "In March, a panel led by Kovind proposed holding state and general elections together in its extensive 18,626-page report. It also recommended local body elections within 100 days.",
      "The committee suggested that if a government loses an election, fresh polls would be held, but its tenure would last only until the next synchronised election.",
      "While this may sound intense, simultaneous polls aren't new to India. They were the norm from the first election in 1951 until 1967, when political upheavals and early dissolutions of state assemblies led to staggered polls.",
      "Efforts to revive the system have been debated for decades, with proposals from the Election Commission in 1983, the Law Commission in 1999 and Niti Aayog, a government think-tank, in 2017.",
      "Does India need simultaneous elections?",
      "The biggest argument for holding simultaneous elections is cutting election costs.",
      "According to the Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Media Studies, India spent more than 600bn rupees ($7.07bn; \u00a35.54bn) on 2019 general elections, making it the world's most expensive at the time.",
      "However, critics argue that the same goal - reducing costs - could backfire.",
      "With 900 million eligible voters, ensuring enough electronic voting machines, security forces and election officials would require extensive planning and resources.",
      "According to a 2015 parliamentary committee report by the law and justice Department, India already spends 45bn rupees on general and state elections.",
      "The report mentioned if simultaneous elections were held then a total 92.84bn rupees would be needed to procure new voting and voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines, which dispenses a slip of paper with the symbol of the party the voter selected. These machines would also need to be replaced every 15 years.",
      "Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi has raised concerns about the high costs. He said they should have been addressed in the Kovind committee report, especially since reducing election expenses was a key reason behind the proposal.",
      "What are the key challenges in implementing this proposal?",
      "Implementing simultaneous elections requires making formal changes or revisions to specific provisions (or articles) of the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country. Some of these changes would need ratification by at least half of India's 28 state assemblies.",
      "While the BJP-led alliance has a simple majority in parliament, it lacks the two-thirds majority needed for such amendments.",
      "The Kovind committee studied models from countries like South Africa, Sweden and Indonesia, suggesting their best practices for India.",
      "In September, the cabinet approved the proposal to hold simultaneous elections and backed two bills pushing for the system on Thursday.",
      "Federal Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has introduced the bills in the parliament.",
      "One bill proposes a constitutional amendment to enable joint federal and state elections, while another aims to align assembly polls in Delhi, Puducherry and Jammu & Kashmir with the general election schedule.",
      "The government has said it is open to referring the bills to a parliamentary committee and consult political parties to build consensus.",
      "Who supports the proposal, and who opposes it?",
      "The Kovind committee contacted all Indian parties for feedback, with 47 responding - 32 supported simultaneous elections, while 15 opposed them.",
      "Most supporters were BJP allies or friendly parties, citing time, cost and resource savings.",
      "The BJP argued that the model code of conduct cost India \"800 days of governance\" in the past five years by delaying welfare schemes.",
      "Prime Minister Modi has supported simultaneous elections.",
      "\"Frequent elections are obstructing the nation's advancement,\" he said in August. \"With elections occurring every three to six months, every scheme is linked to polls.\"",
      "Opposition parties, led by the Congress, have called simultaneous polls \"undemocratic\" and argued that they undermine the country's parliamentary system of government. They say such a setup will give an unfair advantage to national parties over regional ones.",
      "The parties also recommended enhancing transparency in the funding process as a better solution to addressing concerns about election costs.",

    "summary": "Quentin Sommerville is on patrol with HTS in Latakia, as they pledge to protect minorities.",
    "story": [
      "Noor stands trembling in the chill afternoon light of the courtyard, not from the cold, but from fear.",
      "Dressed in her thick winter coat, she has come to make a complaint to the men of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.",
      "She begins to cry as she explains that three days earlier, just before nine in the evening, armed men had arrived in a black van at her apartment in an upscale neighbourhood of the city of Latakia. Along with her children and her husband, an army officer, she was forced out onto the street in her pyjamas. The leader of the armed men then moved his own family into her home.",
      "Noor - not her real name - is Alawite, the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Latakia, on Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is their heartland.",
      "As with other cities, an array of different rebel groups have rushed into the power vacuum left after Assad's soldiers abandoned their posts. The regime had exploited sectarian divisions to maintain its grip on power, now the Sunni Islamist HTS has pledged to respect all religions in Syria. But Latakia's Alawite population is fearful.",
      "Some people haven't even left their homes since the regime change because they worry that there will be a reckoning, and that they will have to pay a heavy price for the support of the old regime.",
      "Noor shows CCTV footage from her apartment, to 34-year-old Abu Ayoub, HTS general security commander. In the film, a group of bearded fighters, some wearing baseball caps and others in military fatigues, is pictured on her doorstep.",
      "They are not from HTS, she says, but another group, rebels from the northern city of Aleppo.",
      "\"They broke down the door. There were 10 militants at our door and 16 others waiting down the street with three cars,\" Noor tells Abu Ayoub. His men are mostly from Idlib and Aleppo, where the HTS and allied rebel factions were based before launching the offensive that overthew Assad three weeks ago. They stand around in combat fatigues, holding their rifles and listening intently as she describes how the family's belongings were thrown into the street.",
      "HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries, although the UK and US say they have been in contact with the group. In a matter of weeks, it has gone from enemy of the state to the law of the land. Abu Ayoub and his men are adjusting to the change in roles from revolutionaries to policemen.",
      "Noor is only one of a long line of complainants who have come to their general security station with grievances. The base, the city's former military intelligence headquarters, was perhaps the most feared place in Latakia. Now it is a shambles, with broken radios and equipment scattered across the courtyard. Torn portraits of Bashar al-Assad lie in the dirt.",
      "A man joins the queue of those making complaints. He has a black eye, broken ribs, and his shirt is torn and bloodied. He says men from Idlib had broken into his apartment.",
      "\"Some of them were civilians, some wore military clothes and were masked,\" he says. \"They hit my daughter and aimed weapons at my son's head. They stole money, they stole gold.\"",
      "Every call-out here is a show of force, especially with so many armed groups in the city. With the man's son directing them, the HTS security force drives to one of the poorer neighbourhoods, weaving through a warren of back streets, past scrapyards and middens.",
      "The armed police take up positions along the street and at the doorway of the apartment. They bring two suspects back to the station for questioning.",
      "But they barely have time to clear their weapons when there is another complaint, a dispute over gas bottles that left another man beaten.",
      "He says three men had pulled guns on him.",
      "Another race in the cars to a crowded commercial and residential neighbourhood. When the police pull a suspect out into the street - his face still bloody from the earlier fight - local women come to their balconies and shout \"Shabiha! Shabiha!\". They are accusing the suspect of being a member of the shadowy militia force, mostly made of Alawite men, who did the Assad regime's dirty work.",
      "Since its lightning-fast sweep to victory across Syria, Islamist HTS has pledged to keep the peace and protect all of the country's minorities. And every day Abu Ayoub has to make good on that pledge.",
      "\"Some infiltrators into the revolution, some saboteurs, and some weak-minded people are taking advantage of the situation in the areas that were recently liberated,\" he says.",
      "Abu Ayoub admits the situation in the city was \"a bit chaotic\" but turns his attention to Noor. \"We are here now, we weren't here when the army left. We were initially in Damascus and then we came. They are thugs, and we will evict them from your house. We will return your belongings. You have my word,\" he said. And with that he orders his men into their pickup trucks and with sirens blaring they head for the apartment.",
      "Latakia is a city liberated. Last Friday, tens of thousands of people from all sects, gathered on the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Assad dynasty. In a city square, they sat atop the plinth where the statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father - who ruled for 29 years before his death in 2000 - once stood, and joyfully waved the flag of a free Syria.",
      "The message that day was unity, of one Syria, without sectarian division. But after half a century of tyrannical rule from a regime which fanned sectarian hatred and warned that Alawites would be massacred if they ever lost power, it is an adjustment to say the least.",
      "On Saturday, three HTS fighters were killed, and 14 injured outside the city, in what it said was gun battle with a criminal gang. HTS, which is trying to maintain calm, claims there was no sectarian element to the attack.",
      "On the way to Noor's apartment, the HTS convoy speed through the streets and passersby cheer them and flash the peace sign.",
      "The new Syrian flag, with its green instead of red stripe, and three red stars instead of two green, is commonplace on shop shutters and hanging from balconies. But in Alawite areas, people mostly watch in silence as the convoy moves along. There are fewer new flags in evidence.",
      "Azam al-Ali, 28, an HTS security officer from Deir al-Sour in eastern Syria sits in the front seat. After so much oppression, he says, it will take time for people to trust authority again.",
      "\"Most of the oppressed that come with complaints are from two sects, the Sunni and the Alawite. We do not differentiate. But the extreme poverty that this regime left behind caused this vast chaos,\" he tells me as the traffic parts for the convoy.",
      "And he notes that Alawites, some of whom were among the poorest in Syria, suffered too under the Assad regime.",
      "We arrive at Noor's apartment and half a dozen armed HTS men hurry up the stairs.",
      "The woman behind the door refuses to open up, but after some negotiation the door opens, and she and her family are ordered to leave. Noor goes in to retrieve some clothes and books for her daughter who is studying for exams. Weapons and ammunition belonging to the rebel squatters are confiscated.",
      "\"When I went to HTS today I was terrified,\" says Noor. \"Their appearance was so intimidating and frightening. Honestly, though, they were very nice.\"",
      "But she won't be returning to the apartment. One nightmare has ended in Syria, and for Alawites, another has begun, she says.",
      "As she clutches her belongings, Noor says she no longer feels safe in her home.",
      "\"It's impossible for me to live here again. I do have hope, but not in the near future. At the moment I don't dare.\""

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:08:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Children in West Bengal are being maimed and killed by bombs, used for decades in the state's violent politics.",
    "story": [
      "Over the last three decades, at least 565 children in the Indian state of West Bengal have been injured or killed by home-made bombs, a BBC Eye investigation has found.",
      "So what are these deadly devices and how are they linked to political violence in West Bengal? And why are so many Bengali children paying the price?",
      "On a bright summer morning in May 1996, six boys from a slum in Kolkata, the capital of India's West Bengal state, stepped out to play cricket in a narrow alley.",
      "Their shantytown, nestled in the middle-class neighbourhood of Jodhpur Park, thrummed with life. It was a holiday - voting day in a general election.",
      "Nine-year-old Puchu Sardar, one of the boys, grabbed a cricket bat and quietly slipped past his sleeping father. Soon, the cracking noise of bat meeting ball echoed through the alley.",
      "A ball batted out of the boundaries of their makeshift pitch sent the boys searching for it in a small garden nearby. There, in a black plastic bag, they found six round objects.",
      "They looked like cricket balls someone had left behind, and the boys returned to the game with their spoils.",
      "One of the \"balls\" from the bag was bowled at Puchu who struck it with his bat.",
      "A deafening explosion tore through the alley. It was a bomb.",
      "As the smoke lifted and neighbours rushed outside, they found Puchu and five of his friends sprawled on the street, their skin blackened, clothes scorched, bodies torn.",
      "Screams pierced the chaos.",
      "Seven-year-old Raju Das, an orphan raised by his aunt, and seven-year-old Gopal Biswas died of their injuries. Four other boys were wounded.",
      "Puchu narrowly survived, having suffered serious burns and shrapnel wounds to his chest, face and abdomen.",
      "He spent over a month in hospital. When he came home he had to use kitchen tongs to remove shrapnel still lodged in his body because his family had run out of money to pay for any more medical care.",
      "Puchu and his friends are part of a long, tragic list of children killed or maimed by crude bombs, which have been used in West Bengal for decades in a bloody battle for dominance in the state's violent politics.",
      "There are no publicly-available figures on the number of casualties in West Bengal.",
      "So the BBC World Service went through every edition of two prominent state newspapers - Anandabazar Patrika and Bartaman Patrika - from 1996 to 2024, looking for reports of children injured or killed by these devices.",
      "We found at least 565 child casualties - 94 deaths and 471 injuries - as of 10 November. This means a child has fallen victim to bomb violence, on average, every 18 days.",
      "However, the BBC has found incidents in which children were wounded by these bombs that were not reported by the two newspapers, so the real number of casualties is likely to be higher.",
      "More than 60% of these incidents involved children playing outdoors - gardens, streets, farms, even near schools - where bombs, typically used during elections to terrorise opponents, were hidden.",
      "Most victims the BBC spoke to were poor, the children of house-help, odd-jobbers, or farm workers.",
      "The revolutionary history of bombs in West Bengal",
      "West Bengal, India's fourth-largest state with a population of more than 100 million, has long struggled with political violence.",
      "Over the years, since India's independence in 1947, the state has cycled through different rulers - the Congress party for two decades, the Communist-led Left Front for three, and the current Trinamool Congress since 2011.",
      "In the late 1960s, the state was wracked by armed conflict between Maoist rebels \u2013 also called Naxalites \u2013 and government forces.",
      "A common thread across all governments and rebel conflicts since then has been the use of bombs as tools of intimidation by political parties to silence opponents, especially during elections.",
      "\"Bombs have been [used to settle scores]. This has been happening in Bengal for a long time, more than 100 years,\" Pankaj Dutta, a former Inspector General of West Bengal police, told us.",
      "Bomb-making in Bengal has its roots in the rebellion against British rule in the early 1900s.",
      "Early efforts were crude and accidents were common: One rebel lost a hand and another died testing a bomb.",
      "Then a rebel returned from France armed with bomb-making skills.",
      "His book bomb - a legal tome loaded with explosives hidden in a Cadbury cocoa tin - would have killed its target, a British magistrate, if he had opened it.",
      "The first explosion rocked Midnapore district in 1907, when revolutionaries derailed a train carrying a senior British official by planting a bomb on the tracks.",
      "A few months later, a botched attempt to kill a magistrate in Muzaffarpur with a bomb hurled into a horse-drawn carriage claimed the lives of two Englishwomen.",
      "The act, described by a newspaper as a \"tremendous explosion that startled the town,\" had turned a teenage rebel called Khudiram Bose into a martyr and the first \"freedom fighter\" in the pantheon of Indian revolutionaries.",
      "Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a nationalist leader, wrote in 1908 that bombs were not just weapons but a new kind of \"magical lore,\" a \"witchcraft\" spreading from Bengal to the rest of India.",
      "Today, Bengal's crude bombs are known locally as\u202fpeto. They are bound with jute strings and stuffed with shrapnel-like nails, nuts and glass.",
      "Variations include explosives packed into steel containers or glass bottles. They are used primarily in violent clashes between rival political parties.",
      "Political activists, particularly in rural areas, use these bombs to intimidate opponents, disrupt voting stations, or retaliate against perceived enemies.",
      "They are often deployed during elections to sabotage polling booths or to assert control over areas.",
      "Children like Poulami Halder bear the brunt of such violence.",
      "On an April morning in 2018, the-then seven-year-old was picking flowers for morning prayers in Gopalpur, a village in the North 24 Parganas district dotted with ponds, paddy fields, and coconut trees. Village council elections were barely a month away.",
      "Poulami saw a ball lying near a neighbour's water pump.",
      "\"I picked it up and brought it home,\" she recalls.",
      "As she stepped inside, her grandfather, sipping tea, froze at the sight of the object in her hand.",
      "\"He said, 'It's not a ball - it's a bomb! Throw it away!' Before I could react, it exploded in my hand.\"",
      "The blast shattered the quiet of the village. Poulami was struck in the \"eyes, face, and hands\" and fainted, as chaos erupted around her.",
      "\"I remember people running towards me, but I could see very little. I was hit everywhere.\"",
      "Villagers rushed her to the hospital.",
      "Her injuries were devastating \u2013 her left hand was amputated, and she spent nearly a month in hospital.",
      "An ordinary morning routine had turned into a nightmare, forever altering Poulami's life in a single, shattering moment.",
      "Poulami is not alone.",
      "Sabina Khatun was 10 years old when a crude bomb exploded in her hand in April 2020 in Jitpur, a village flanked by rice and jute fields in Murshidabad district.",
      "She had been taking her goat out to graze when she stumbled upon the bomb lying in the grass. Curious, she picked it up and began playing with it.",
      "Moments later, it detonated in her hands.",
      "\"The moment I heard the explosion, I thought, who's going to be disabled this time? Has Sabina been maimed?,\" her mother, Ameena Bibi, says, her voice heavy with anguish.",
      "\"When I stepped outside, I saw people carrying Sabina in their arms. The flesh was visible from her hand.\"",
      "Doctors were forced to amputate Sabina's hand.",
      "Since returning home, she has struggled to rebuild her life, her parents consumed by despair over an uncertain future. Their fears are not unwarranted: In India, women with disabilities often face social stigma that complicate their prospects for marriage and jobs.",
      "\"My daughter kept crying, saying she would never get her hand back,\" says Ameena.",
      "\"I kept consoling her, telling her, 'your hand will grow back, your fingers will grow back.'\"",
      "Now, Sabina grapples with the loss of her hand and the struggle with simple daily tasks. \"I struggle with drinking water, eating, showering, getting dressed, going to the toilet.\"",
      "The children of the bombs",
      "In the Indian state of West Bengal, children are routinely maimed, blinded, or killed by home-made bombs. BBC Eye investigates the political violence that underlies this tragedy and asks why the carnage is allowed to continue.",
      "Watch on iPlayer or, if you are outside the UK, watch on YouTube",
      "Maimed by bombs yet lucky to survive, these children have had their lives changed forever.",
      "Poulami, now 13, received an artificial hand but couldn't use it - too heavy and quickly outgrown. Sabina, 14, struggles with failing eyesight.",
      "Her family says she needs another operation to remove bomb debris from her eyes, but they cannot afford it.",
      "Puchu, now 37, was pulled out of school by his fearful parents and spent years refusing to step outside, often hiding under his bed at the slightest noise.",
      "He never picked up a cricket bat again. His childhood stolen, he's now scraping by with odd construction jobs and bears the scars of his past.",
      "But all hope is not lost.",
      "Poulami and Sabina have both learned to ride a bicycle with one hand and continue to go to school. Both dream of becoming teachers. Puchu hopes for a brighter future for his son, Rudra, five, -  a future in uniform as a policeman.",
      "Despite the terrible toll it inflicts, there is no sign of crude bomb violence in West Bengal ending.",
      "None of the political parties admit to using bombs for political gain.",
      "When the BBC asked the four main political parties in West Bengal whether they were involved, directly or through intermediaries, in manufacturing or using crude bombs, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not respond.",
      "The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) strongly denied being involved, saying it was \"committed to upholding the rule of law\u2026and that when it comes to protecting rights and lives, children are of the utmost concern\".",
      "The Indian National Congress (INC) also strongly denied using crude bombs for electoral advantage, and said it had \"never engaged in any violence for political or personal gain\".",
      "Although no political party will admit responsibility, none of the experts who spoke to the BBC is in any doubt this carnage is rooted in Bengal's culture of political violence.",
      "\"During any major election here you will see the rampant use of bombs,\" Pankaj Dutta told us. \"Extreme abuse of childhood is going on. It is a lack of care on the part of the society.\" Mr Dutta passed away in November.",
      "Poulami adds: \"Those who planted the bombs are still free. No one should leave bombs lying around. No child should ever be harmed like this again.\"",
      "'Look what they have done to my son'",
      "But the tragedy continues.",
      "In May this year in the Hooghly district, three boys playing near a pond unknowingly stumbled upon a cache of bombs. The explosion killed Raj Biswas, nine, and left his friend maimed, missing an arm. The other boy escaped with leg fractures.",
      "\"Look what they have done to my son,\" Raj's grieving father sobbed as he caressed the forehead of his dead child.",
      "As Raj's body was lowered into a grave, political slogans crackled through the air from a nearby election rally: \"Hail Bengal!\" the crowd chanted, \"Hail Bengal!\"",
      "It was election time. And once again, children were paying the price."

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:43:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Inside the infamous prison's corridors it becomes clear how hard it will be to mend the Syria that Assad broke.",
    "story": [
      "Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.",
      "In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.",
      "As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.",
      "One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women \u2013 as well as children \u2013 who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag.",
      "Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.",
      "But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.",
      "The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution.",
      "I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.",
      "Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited.",
      "When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.",
      "In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates.",
      "In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away.",
      "The record",
      "One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.",
      "Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.",
      "The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future.",
      "A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.",
      "Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing.",
      "\"Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me\" Safana told me. \"It is very chaotic... Where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos?\"",
      "It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence.",
      "The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks.",
      "\"What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel?",
      "\"It's terrible\u2026 terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives.\"",
      "Justice, or revenge?",
      "It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.",
      "A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.",
      "When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home.",
      "Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible.",
      "At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes.",
      "A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated.",
      "One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya.",
      "\"It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering.\"",
      "Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014.",
      "\"We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me.\"",
      "Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.",
      "Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed.",
      "One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates.",
      "\"We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next.\"",
      "His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true.",
      "Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad.",
      "\"Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account.\"",
      "\"Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured.\"",
      "Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: \"Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\"",
      "Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished.",
      "Corruption",
      "The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds.",
      "Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out.",
      "Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.",
      "His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (\u00a339,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000.",
      "After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke.",
      "Hassan was overjoyed to get home.",
      "\"When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood.\"",
      "But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds.",
      "\"They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this.",
      "\"We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us.\"",
      "The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands.",
      "The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.",
      "Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:14:26 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC Africa speaks exclusively to a man from Ghana who was held captive by insurgents in Burkina Faso.",
    "story": [
      "A man from Ghana has told the BBC how he was seized at gunpoint by jihadists in neighbouring Burkina Faso, before being taken to their vast desert camp where he gained a rare insight into their lives - from the children he believed were trained as suicide bombers, to the tunnels they had dug to shield themselves and their armoured tanks from air strikes.",
      "In his first media interview since his 2019 ordeal, the man - whom we are calling James to protect his identity - said his first day at the camp was terrifying as a huge number of Islamist fighters returned from an operation, firing shots in the air.",
      "\"I thought that was the end. I was just sweating,\" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns - and laughed.",
      "James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.",
      "\"The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles]. So he asked me which of them I could operate, and I said I had never operated one before. He said: 'We have bigger weapons, so if I give you a battalion to handle, no-one can harm you',\" James added.",
      "He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana - a promise he says he never kept.",
      "Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.",
      "\"I met him in an attempt to sensitise tertiary-level students,\" said Mawuli Agbenu, the commission's regional director in the capital, Accra.",
      "\"We will definitely have a way of engaging with him so that he will be an ambassador or an influencer within his community,\" Mr Agbenu added.",
      "Long a stable democracy, Ghana has so far been spared the violence that has seen the insurgency spread, causing havoc in Burkina Faso and its West African neighbours.",
      "The insurgents who kidnapped James belonged to Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), or The Support Group for Islam and Muslims. An affiliate of al-Qaeda, it was officially launched in 2017 as an umbrella body for various jihadist groups in the region.",
      "In Burkina Faso, they are strongest in the north, where they control large areas, but they have also expanded to the south, along the porous 550km-long (340 mile) border with Ghana.",
      "More than 15,000 people from Burkina Faso have fled into northern Ghana to escape the conflict, aid agencies say.",
      "Apart from Burkina Faso, the jihadists have also gained territory in Niger and Mali, and have carried out attacks in Ivory Coast,  Benin and Togo - all former French colonies - raising fears that the insurgency was spreading south towards the coast.",
      "In April, a senior UN official said that \"the epicentre of terrorism has shifted from the Middle East and North Africa into sub-Saharan Africa, concentrated largely in the Sahel region [which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger]\".",
      "Jihadists linked to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group operate in the region.",
      "A Ghanaian security officer stationed along the border with Burkina Faso told the BBC that the jihadists often crossed over to regroup when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military - and they also used the country to smuggle weapons, food and fuel.",
      "\"It\u2019s not safe for Ghana. They hide in towns like Pusiga. Residents of border communities are worried because there\u2019s no tight security,\" he added.",
      "In a report released in July, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank said the \"absence of real attacks on Ghanaian soil seems to result from JNIM's calculus of not disturbing supply lines and places of rest as well as not provoking a relatively strong army\".",
      "\"Examples of people who are spared by JNIM by showing their Ghanaian identity cards fits this reading,\" it added.",
      "Most Ghanaians are Christians, but the population near the border with Burkina Faso is mainly Muslim - and parts of the region have also been riven with ethnic tensions, raising fears that the jihadists could exploit them to their advantage.",
      "The think-tank said that JNIM had attempted in a \"very small number\" of instances to recruit or incite Ghana's small, largely Muslim Fulani community to carry out attacks.",
      "JNIM claimed that they were marginalised, but its recruitment efforts had \"minimal success\" as the Fulani were \"aware of the chaos that has enveloped the Sahel due to familial networks\" and did not want it to occur in Ghana, the think-tank added.",
      "A Fulani Muslim preacher in Burkina Faso, Amadou Koufa, is the co-founder of JNIM and is its second-in-command. He recruits most of his fighters from the Fulani community in Burkina Faso.",
      "The military has been accused by rights groups of retaliating by stigmatising Fulanis, and carrying out indiscriminate attacks on their villages in Burkina Faso.",
      "In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.",
      "Although some were operating in insurgency-hit countries like Burkina Faso, others had been sent back to their villages in northern Ghana to preach their \"radical faith\", it added.",
      "This could eventually lead to the jihadists gaining \"a sustainable foothold in remote and peripheral areas in the north\", the NGO said.",
      "Since 2022, Ghana has been at the forefront of efforts to create a new Western-backed, 10,000-strong regional force to combat the Islamist insurgency.",
      "Tamale - the biggest city in northern Ghana - is supposed to be the force's headquarters.",
      "However, the headquarters has not yet opened, and the fate of the initiative is unclear after the region split between pro-Western and pro-Russian states.",
      "Burkina Faso - along with Mali and Niger - have pivoted towards Russia. The three countries have formed their own alliance to fight the insurgents, and have also relied on help from Russian mercenaries.",
      "Ghana and other regional states have remained allied with the West.",
      "Ghana's military has established bases in the north, but newly installed border surveillance equipment was not yet working, the security officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC.",
      "However, more troops have been sent since JNIM carried out two attacks, late last month and earlier this month, on the Burkina Faso side of the border, the officer added.",
      "Ghana's government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "However, its ambassador to Burkina Faso, Boniface Gambila Adagbila, told the BBC the two countries were helping each other to fight the insurgents, warning that if Burkina Faso fails \"Ghana may likely to be the next place\".",
      "Ghana's National Democratic Congress (NDC) party - which will form the next government after winning elections on 7 December - promised in its campaign manifesto to \"enhance\" border security with \"international partners\", as well as improve the country's intelligence capabilities.",
      "In August 2023, the European Union announced that as part of a 20m euro ($21.6m; \u00a316.6m) aid package it would supply Ghana with about 100 armoured vehicles, as well as surveillance equipment such as drones.",
      "Many civilians and refugees cross the Ghana-Burkina Faso border through footpaths and back roads to work, trade or visit relatives despite the security risk - and James said he was one of them. He was travelling all the way to Senegal on his motorbike when he was taken captive.",
      "After riding for nearly a day, he said he encountered the insurgents in north-western Burkina Faso, as he was nearing the border with Mali.",
      "A handful of jihadists, also on motorbikes, stopped him and took him to their camp where he was interrogated until their commander was convinced that he was not a spy, James said.",
      "He added that his blindfold - the trademark black jihadist flag - was then removed.",
      "James said he found about 500 insurgents - mostly young men, including one who identified himself as a doctor - living in the camp.",
      "Located in desert-like terrain, it was made up of thatch-roofed huts, with small electricity-generating solar panels, he said.",
      "He added that the camp was divided into three sections - for commanders and their families, lower-ranking jihadists and captured villagers and soldiers.",
      "James said he was detained in the latter section, but got \"closer\" to the jihadists in the second week as he increasingly acted as though he had become a sympathiser of their cause.",
      "They sat around in groups of five or 10, and listened to the songs of Salif Ke\u00efta, the Malian musician known as the Golden Voice of Africa, James said.",
      "Other jihadist groups have banned music, saying it is un-Islamic.",
      "James said that while the atmosphere at the camp was generally relaxed, groups of jihadists regularly went to fight, firing celebratory shots when they returned, claiming to have achieved battlefield success.",
      "James said he realised that this was the gunfire he had heard on the first day, and got used to it.",
      "He added that the insurgents parked their tanks and pick-up trucks in two inter-connected tunnels to ensure they were not destroyed if there was an air strike, while only a few vehicles remained outside \"on stand-by, for an emergency\".",
      "He said the jihadists also revealed their darkest sides - telling him they captured women during raids on villages and sold them to each other.",
      "\"They trade the women they\u2019ve captured. Others sell wives that they are fed up with. Those who resist are gang-raped into submission by two or three fighters,\" James added, though he did not see them do this.",
      "James said the women at the camp included the wives of jihadists who performed domestic chores like cooking and cleaning, while those who were captured were either sex-slaves or were forced to become fighters.",
      "He explained that he saw fully veiled women, with AK-47 rifles hidden under their clothes, leave the camp to raid villages for livestock to feed people at the camp - or to sell at markets in nearby towns.",
      "James said he also saw dozens of children, including those of jihadists, being trained in the use of weapons and explosives.",
      "\"You'll see a small kid holding a gun and telling you that if he goes to meet some people, this is how he is going to kill them,\" James added.",
      "He said he twice saw four children being taken to another location, before returning to the camp with suicide vests.",
      "They wore long, loose outfits over them, and left the camp with begging bowls, James said.",
      "Jihadists told him that when they anticipate a tough battle in a town or military camp, they send children disguised as beggars who then blow themselves up, so the fighters can enter amid the chaos, James said.",
      "He added that three jihadists had told him that they \"sacrifice their children as suicide bombers and they get paid after every mission\", though they did not disclose the amount.",
      "He said the jihadists tried to indoctrinate him, preaching that \"anything Western is evil\" and showing him propaganda videos every night, including one of the US invasion of Iraq and the killing of Palestinians in the current conflict with Israel.",
      "According to James, as the insurgency was being waged in French-speaking countries, all the jihadists were Francophone, but one spoke English with a Ghanaian accent, and always kept his face covered so that he could not see him.",
      "In a sign that the jihadists were also influenced by pan-Africanism, James said some of them invoked the names of revolutionaries like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and told him that people should \"rise up\" against \"bad leaders\" and free themselves from \"bondage\".",
      "James said the jihadists also expressed the view that if Sankara and Nkrumah had \"lived long\",  then \"the whole of Africa would have been a better place - nobody would have travelled from Africa to the West. People would have been travelling from the West to Africa\".",
      "James, unemployed at the time, said their rhetoric was powerful, and only \"strength of heart\" prevented him from joining their ranks.",
      "On how exactly he was captured, James said that two Muslim friends were travelling with him at the time, promising to introduce him to a Muslim spiritual leader in Senegal who could pray for him and improve his fortunes.",
      "All three of them were intercepted by the jihadists as they were coming to the end of the first leg of their trip, he said.",
      "James added one of his friends was shot dead as he attempted to flee, while his other friend was taken with him to the camp.",
      "James said the commander did not release his friend, making him fear that he had been forced to join the jihadists - or was dead.",
      "\"The commander told me that: 'I will let you go if you assure me you will get me more fighters',\" James said.",
      "He added that before driving him to a bus rank and giving him the fare for the trip back home, the insurgents gave him a contact number to keep in touch, but, James said, he never did and changed his number.",
      "According to James, the jihadists also gave him charms, which supposedly had supernatural powers.",
      "Again, many other jihadists reject the use of amulets, believing them to be contrary to the teachings of Islam.",
      "James showed the BBC the amulets, which were made of fowl feathers, animal skins and herbs, covered in leather and cloth.",
      "They included one which the jihadists falsely told him offered protection from bullets.",
      "James said he never got the impression that the insurgents wanted to destabilise Ghana, seeing it as the \"safest place\" to hide when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military.",
      "Their focus was on waging an insurgency in countries where France and the US \"exists\", believing that these two countries exploit Africa's resources, to the detriment of its people, James said. This is denied by both countries.",
      "Ghana-based security analyst Adib Saani expressed concern about the growing insurgency in West Africa, and said he did not see a military solution to it.",
      "\u201cWe need to go beyond the militarised posture. We must address the socio-economic and geopolitical deficits that are creating the environment for terrorism to strive,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "Ghana's National Commission for Civic Education has been carrying out a public awareness campaign dubbed \"see something, say something\" to encourage residents in the north to report suspicious activity.",
      "The campaign has also been extended to Accra, to educate young people about the dangers of jihadism.",
      "The commission's Mr Agbanu told the BBC that the campaign was vital as Ghanaians were vulnerable to recruitment.",
      "\"There\u2019s a high rate of corruption, unequal development across the country, and huge youth unemployment,\" he said.",
      "James, who is now a subsistence farmer, said that he was just relieved to be alive as the jihadist commander had told him that he was making an exception by releasing him because normally it was \"either your dead body that will go home or nobody will ever hear of you again\".",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:01:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Thanks to climate change and tougher vines, Denmark and Sweden have a growing number of wineries.",
    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",

    "title": "Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more children",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:10:32 GMT",
    "summary": "India, the world's most populous country, is seeing a debate about having more babies.",
    "story": [
      "Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates.",
      "With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up.",
      "Leaders of two southern states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu \u2013 have recently advocated more children.",
      "Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises.",
      "India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.",
      "Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.)",
      "The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s.",
      "Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries.",
      "But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.",
      "\"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC.",
      "Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976.",
      "This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom.",
      "Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation.",
      "Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.",
      "\"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\"",
      "The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli.",
      "This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves.",
      "But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.",
      "The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?",
      "Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report.",
      "In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\".",
      "Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift.",
      "Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.",
      "While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli.",
      "As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting.",
      "While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\".",
      "A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".",
      "\"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "This is already happening in some countries.",
      "In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.",
      "But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "WATCH: Why do some in India want couples to have more children?",
      "For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations.",
      "Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\".",
      "India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "\"American Me\" (1992)",
      "In his first film as director, Edward James Olmos stars as a prison gang leader who, upon his release, tries to maintain his hold on criminal organizations and drug trafficking in Los Angeles.",
      "\"Angels With Dirty Faces\" (1938)",
      "Once the Hays Office decided in the early 1930s that movies had become too violent and licentious, bad guys either had to make good for their crimes, or pay the ultimate price. No longer could James Cagney break the law and get away with it! Director Michael Curtiz's film about childhood friends who follow different paths \u2014 Cagney, as gangster Rocky Sullivan, and Pat O'Brien, as Father Connolly \u2014 offers a redemptive tale in which young hoodlums idolize Rocky. But when the condemned criminal is being led to the execution chamber, his change of heart \u2014 pretending to die a coward's death \u2014 offers a way out for the impressionable youth. One of Cagney's best performances, the film also features Humphrey Bogart as a crooked lawyer, Ann Sheridan, and the Dead End Kids (whose Hollywood careers would turn from kitchen sink drama to slapstick comedy).",
      "\"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" (a.k.a. \"Serpentine Dance \u2013 Annabelle\") (1895)",
      "This early Edison short film captures dancer Annabelle Moore maneuvering fabric-wings. Several versions of the film were released, including some with color tints.",
      "\"Beverly Hills Cop\" (1984)",
      "Eddie Murphy had already appeared in two hit films \u2014 \"48 HRS.,\" opposite Nick Nolte, and \"Trading Places,\" pairing off against Dan Aykroyd \u2014 but in \"Beverly Hills Cop\" Murphy carried the film on his own as Detroit detective Axel Foley, a fish-out-of-water who has gone to Los Angeles on the trail of a killer. Buoyed by Murphy's screen charisma and Harold Faltermeyer's electronic score, the mix of action and comedy was a blockbuster, a formula carried forth in three sequels starring Murphy.",
      "\"The Chelsea Girls\" (1966)",
      "Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey's 16mm feature was a proto-typical underground movie \u2014 heavily improvised, with rough edits (or no edits), multiple and split screens, and a leisurely 3.5-hour length. Being banned in Boston at least added to its allure. Today, the film, set in the landmark Chelsea Hotel in New York City, and featuring Nico, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, International Velvet, Mario Montez, Mary Woronov, Dorothy Dean and other Warhol \"Superstars,\" offers a unique time capsule of the bohemian 1960s.",

      "\"Dirty Dancing\" (1987)",
      "At a 1960s Catskills resort, a teenage girl vacationing with family hits the dance floor with a hot instructor, and summers would never be the same. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze starred in the hit romance that earned the Jennifer Warnes-Bill Medley song \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" an Oscar and a Grammy.",
      "\"Ganja and Hess\" (1973)",
      "Duane Jones, who played the lead in \"Night of the Living Dead,\" stars in this horror story in which an anthropologist studying ancient African cultures becomes a vampire.

      "When little David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) wakes up in the middle of the night and witnesses a spaceship landing nearby, he tries to convince his dad it was real. But when dad returns from investigating the landing site, there's something not quite right about him. And then, a similar change comes over his mother. What are those strange marks on the back of their necks? What's poor little David to do? Fifties paranoia blends with stylish photography, cool-looking sets, and ridiculous Martian costumes in this nostalgic sci-fi tale directed by William Cameron Menzies.",

      "A wild addition to the genre of apocalyptic cinema, this silent cartoon by Max and Dave Fleischer features Koko the Clown and his naughty dog Fitz, visiting the place that runs our planet's weather. Alas, there is a lever that warns, if pulled, it will mean the end of the Earth! Restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive primarily from the original nitrate negative, this is a hilarious take on the End Times \u2014 and the problem of pets that refuse to obey. Bad, BAD dog! [You can watch the restored film here.]",
      "\"My Family/Mi familia\" (1995)",
      "Directed by Gregory Nava (\"The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez\"), this emotional and tearful multi-generational story of Mexican immigrants settling in East Los Angeles stars Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Elpidia Carrillo and Enrique Castillo.",
      "\"The Miracle Worker\" (1962)",
      "Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke each won Academy Awards for their performances in the true story of Anne Sullivan and her attempts to teach Helen Keller, a child deaf and blind since she was a toddler. Keller's autobiography was originally adapted for television and later Broadway (Bancroft and Duke both starred in the stage version). Director Arthur Penn's black-and-white film version preserved the actresses' performances in a cooly unsentimental story of determination and human connection.",
      "\"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991)",
      "Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy\") wrote and directed this haunting tale of friendship, loosely based on plays of Shakespeare, starring River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves as street hustlers searching for family and connection.",
      "\"No Country for Old Men\" (2007)",
      "The Coen Brothers' sharp precision and keen eye for irony is beautifully on display in this enthralling modern-day Western, in which Josh Brolin's hunter comes across the scene of a drug deal gone very bad. Alas, that satchel containing mounds of currency with no living owner is just a little too tempting to pass by. Enter Javier Bardem's sinister hit man, hot on Brolin's trail, who will let nothing deter him from his prey. Based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the film won four Academy Awards, including best picture, best direction, and best supporting actor for Bardem, weird haircut and all.",
      "\"Powwow Highway\" (1989)",
      "A prize-winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Jonathan Wacks' comic-drama was remarkable in its time for telling a humanistic story of Native Americans without resorting to stereotypes. Gary Farmer and A. Martinez star as former childhood friends who reconnect for a road trip in a dilapidated car, a journey that is by turns spiritual and criminal.",
      "\"The Pride of the Yankees\" (1942)",
      "An inspirational biopic of one of sports' true legends, this story of New York Yankee Lou Gehrig, whose life came undone with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS (what came to become known as Lou Gehrig's disease), stars Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright, and features several of Gehrig's teammates (including Babe Ruth) as themselves. Cooper's reenactment of Gehrig's farewell speech at Yankee Stadium (in which he states, \"Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\") became one of the actor's most memorable moments.",
      "\"The Social Network\" (2010)",
      "Like the Akira Kurosawa classic \"Rashomon,\" \"The Social Network\" uses competing points of view to decipher the origins of Facebook, as told through legal depositions being filed years after the revolutionary website was born, by former friends now suing each other. Based on Ben Mezrich's \"The Accidental Billionaires,\" David Fincher's classic is a tale of genius, hubris and ethics, involving a paradox: A site founded on the notion of exclusivity which grew to host hundreds of millions of members. Starring Jessie Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield, Max Minghella, Armie Hammer, and Justin Timberlake, and an Oscar-winning script by Aaron Sorkin. Oscars also went to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for their haunting score, and to editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.",
      "\"Spy Kids\" (2001)",
      "Writer-director Robert Rodriguez made a splash with his debut feature, \"El Mariachi,\" and followed with \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk till Dawn.\" But for the fantasy \"Spy Kids,\" he connected with his inner kid, in a story about two children of secret agents who go out on a mission to rescue their captured parents. Starring Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as mom-and-pop spies, and Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as their budding young agents, the film was a hit, spawning a franchise (including a 3-D entry starring Sylvester Stallone).",
      "\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982)",
      "The first film of the \"Star Trek\" franchise to be inducted in the National Film Registry, it's considered by most to be the best movie, in capturing both the zing of the original TV series and the camaraderie of the Enterprise crew. Directed by Nicholas Meyer, it's a sequel of sorts to the 1967 episode \"Space Seed,\" in which a 20th century villain in hibernation is thawed out, stirring much interplanetary trouble. In \"Wrath of Khan,\" Ricardo Montalban returns in the role of Khan, who sets his sights not just on destroying worlds, but also in taking revenge against Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). There is action galore, but it's Kirk's friendship with Spock (Leonard Nimoy) that gives this film its emotional heft.",
      "\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974)",
      "Among exploitation movies, horror is a genre that has enticed many aspiring filmmakers with little money but lots of fake blood at hand. But Tobe Hooper's grand guignol tale of a group of young people who find themselves at the wrong isolated farmhouse went far beyond typical drive-in fare. It would give rise to countless slasher films (from \"Halloween\" to \"Friday the 13th\") in which a weapon-wielding bad guy (in this case Leatherface) ticks off cast members one by one. Nasty, bloody and weirdly funny, the film even found itself projected onto the screen of the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 a fact it heralded in newspaper ads, as if that would give a low-budget horror film more street cred.",
      "\"Up in Smoke\" (1978)",
      "The counter-culture duo Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong had already released five successful comedy albums (including \"Big Bambu\" and \"Los Cochinos\") when they dipped their toes into movies with this stoner comedy. Dipped their toes isn't exactly accurate, though; they plunged head-first into a wild m\u00e9lange of bits involving marijuana, LSD, hash, cocaine (or Ajax cleanser mistaken for cocaine), alcohol, and pills that are anybody's guess what they are. \"Up in Smoke\" took in more than $100 million at the box office, leading to a string of Cheech & Chong films.",
      "\"Uptown Saturday Night\" (1974)",
      "Bill Cosby, Harry Belafonte, and director Sidney Poitier star in this action comedy in which victims of a robbery go in search of a stolen wallet containing a winning lottery ticket. With Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson, Roscoe Lee Browne and Rosalind Cash. Poitier directed two follow-up films starring himself and Cosby, \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\"",
      "\"Will\" (1981)",

    "summary": "Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree, reflects on his groundbreaking career, the impact of family and his lasting legacy in film.",
    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",
      "Coppola went on to adapt S.E. Hinton's \"The Outsiders\" and \"Rumble Fish,\" which featured his nephew, Nicolas Cage.",
      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts. Reflecting on his priorities, Coppola said, \"I want my children to be healthy, and I want them to be happy in their work, which they seem to be. I'm now more concerned that there's going to be an Earth here that's going to sustain itself.\"",
      "Now, as a Kennedy Center honoree, Coppola reflected on how he views himself, saying, \"I think of someone who loved his human family \u2014 not just my immediate family, but the entire human family. That's who I am. I am the one who loves everybody.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors\u00a0ceremony, which took place on Dec. 8, 2024, will be broadcast on CBS on Dec. 22.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "Abdul filed a notice of settlement of the case in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. It still must be approved by a judge.",
      "\"I am grateful that this chapter has successfully come to a close and is now something I can now put behind me,\" Abdul said in a statement Friday. \"This has been a long and hard-fought personal battle. I hope my experience can serve to inspire other women, facing similar struggles, to overcome their own challenges with dignity and respect, so that they too can turn the page and begin a new chapter of their lives.\"",
      "The court filing said the settlement was unconditional, but did not reveal the terms, and Abdul's attorney Melissa Eubanks said she could not comment on them.",
      "An email seeking comment from attorneys for Lythgoe was not immediately answered.",
      "The lawsuit filed nearly a year ago had also accused Lythgoe of sexually assaulting Abdul after she left \"American Idol\" and became a judge on Lythgoe's other competition show, \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",
      "Lythgoe said at the time that he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the allegations, which he called \"an appalling smear.\"",
      "After other lawsuits were filed alleging sexual misconduct, Lythgoe\u00a0stepped down in January from his role\u00a0as a judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance.\"",

      "The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, as Abdul has done.",
      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \"one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\"",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \"American Idol,\" which premiered in 2002.",
      "Abdul says Lythgoe groped her in the elevator of their hotel after a day of filming and \"began shoving his tongue down her throat.\" Abdul pushed him away and ran to her hotel room when the elevator doors opened.",
      "\"In tears, Abdul quickly called one of her representatives to inform them of the assault,\" the lawsuit says, \"but ultimately decided not to take action for fear that Lythgoe would have her fired.\"",
      "Abdul starred as a judge for the first eight seasons, leaving in 2009.",
      "In 2015, Abdul became a judge on \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" appearing alongside Lythgoe.",
      "Around that time, Abdul alleged in the lawsuit, Lythgoe forced himself on top of her during a dinner at his home and tried to kiss her. Abdul said she again pushed Lythgoe away and immediately left.",
      "Abdul left that reality show after two seasons. She has not worked with Lythgoe since.",
      "In a statement at the time of the suit, Lythgoe said \"While Paula's history of erratic behavior is well known, I can't pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue.\""

This year, the 13-time Grammy Award winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and one of Rolling Stone's greatest singers and guitar players of all time, added another accolade to her already impressive resume: Kennedy Center honoree.",

      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 09:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The FDA's top food official says the safety of the dye called Red 40 hasn't been assessed in over a decade, despite concerns over its potential behavioral health effects.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What is red dye 3?",
      "The dye called Red No. 3, also made of petroleum, is what gives a bright cherry-red color to a lot of foods and candies.",
      "\"There seems to be an increased risk, at least in rats, of thyroid cancer. We also see an association with hyperactivity in kids,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday.",
      "Scientists, consumer protection groups and food safety groups have petitioned the FDA to withdraw their approval for Red No. 3, and the FDA is expected to act sometime in the next few weeks, Gounder said.",
      "This dye has already been banned in cosmetics and topical medications since 1990.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Gounder said it's important to look at labels since it's the only way to know if there are synthetic dyes in a product.",
      "\"You can't look at the color. Even white foods may have synthetic dyes to make it brighter,\" she said.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "summary": "Aaron Siri, an attorney to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., petitioned the FDA to \"withdraw or suspend\" its approval of a polio vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell issued an apparent warning Friday to Robert F. Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said in a statement.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, denounced efforts \"to undermine public confidence in proven cures\" like the polio vaccine.",
      "\"The polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease. Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they're dangerous,\" McConnell said.",
      "McConnell credited the \"miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love\" with saving him from paralysis when he contracted the disease at two years of age, and he praised\u00a0 the \"miracle\" of \"the saving power of the polio vaccine\" for the millions of children who came after him.",
      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",
      "Siri has been acting as an adviser to the transition team for Kennedy, who, if confirmed by the Senate, would oversee the FDA and the nation's other public health agencies.",
      "Siri called the Times article a \"hit piece\" that did not engage with the substance of the \"legitimate\" concern at the center of the petition he filed for ICAN.",
      "\"ICAN's petition, filed in 2022, makes the reasonable request that the FDA, as required by federal law, require a proper clinical trial for IPOL prior to licensure,\" Siri posted on X.",
      "The Times report on Siri's work sparked a renewed round of backlash against Kennedy by Democrats, too, who have criticized Trump for months over his ties with Kennedy.",
      "As HHS secretary, Kennedy would have significant direct authority as the nation's health secretary over how vaccines are studied, approved and recommended in the U.S. He and his FDA commissioner would also oversee how government lawyers respond to many of the legal battles Siri has launched against the agency over vaccines.",
      "Kennedy himself has said he would not ban vaccines and has tried to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, instead calling for further study of the shots. He recently resigned as chair of Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that watchdog groups have found for years to be spreading misinformation over fears about vaccines.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has said he might be open to getting rid of some vaccines \"if I think it's dangerous,\" pledging to listen to Kennedy.",
      "\"We're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it,\" Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published this week, when he was asked if he'd sign off on a move by Kennedy to end childhood vaccination programs.",
      "Extensive medical research has conclusively shown that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Siri's petition for ICAN has not progressed much at the FDA since it was filed in 2022. It is one of several legal efforts Siri has filed for groups against several shots, including a petition in 2020 over hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",
      "Many children who receive immunizations for polio often do not receive IPOL, but rather, one of several combination vaccines that blend a harmless version of the poliovirus with other recommended antigens for various vaccine-preventable diseases.",
      "The CDC says IPOL is \"mainly used as a travel vaccine for adults.\" The agency says that the \"body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports\" the safety of polio vaccines.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",

If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "Schumer, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the legislation,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the bill would \"ensure Americans are not erroneously denied their well-earned Social Security benefits simply because they chose at some point to work in their careers in public service.\" As majority leader, he can invoke a Senate rule that would skip a committee hearing and send the bill directly to a floor vote by the full Senate.",
      "That's important, as the clock is ticking as to its fate, with only days left in the current session of Congress.",

      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers.

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:37:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Each year, Social Security benefits are adjusted to account for inflation so beneficiaries' purchasing power doesn't erode over time. In 2025, the annual\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment\u00a0will be 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021 due to cooling inflation.",
      "For most Social Security beneficiaries, the new COLA goes into effect with their January payment.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained.

      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting. If the Fed cuts by another 0.25 percentage points on Dec. 18, interest rates will have declined by a full percentage point since September.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" Daco added.",

    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",

      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon knew of the link between increased worker injuries and the company's production quotas, but its executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations to loosen its mandates, an investigation by lawmakers found.",
      "The findings are based on Internal Amazon documents compiled by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "\"The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon's warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Amazon's executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.\"",
      "Amazon disputes the findings and accused Sanders of misrepresenting the company's safety record.",
      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",
      "Amazon disputes those findings. Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Airline travel in 2025 is set to become more dignified for passengers with disabilities under a new Department of Transportation rule.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Monday announced enhanced protections for people with disabilities traveling on commercial airlines. The new regulations are aimed in particular at protecting\u00a0passengers who use wheelchairs, after a series of violations of existing laws by airlines.",
      "For example, the new rule requires training for airlines workers responsible for physically assisting passengers with disabilities and handling their wheelchairs. It also outlines steps airlines must take if they damage or misplace a passenger's wheelchair \u2014 all in an effort to make the skies friendlier for the roughly 5.5 million Americans use a wheelchair.",

      "Indeed, when a passenger is unable to access or use their mobility device, they're effectively deprived of their freedom until it's returned or replaced.",
      "Concern over airlines' mishandling of records leads many passengers with disabilities to avoid air travel altogether, research has shown.",
      "\"Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly \u2014 and we've taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,\" Secretary Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. \"With the new protections we're announcing today, we're establishing a new standard for air travel \u2014 with clear and thorough guidelines for airlines to ensure that passengers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.\"",
      "Here's some of what the new rule requires.",
      "The rule requires that airlines assist individuals with disabilities without putting them at heightened risk of bodily injury. It must also assist them in a \"dignified\" manner, by respecting their independence, autonomy and privacy.\u00a0Airline personnel must be trained annually on physically assisting passengers who use wheelchairs or mobility devices. They must demonstrate their qualifications through competency assessments or by certification exam.It requires that passengers with disabilities receive prompt assistance when boarding and deplaning aircraft, including moving within the airport terminal.\u00a0Airlines must return all checked wheelchairs and other assistive devices to passengers in the same condition they were received.Improved seating accommodations at airports.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that his new administration will challenge a deal reached between the Social Security Administration and its union that would allow employees to continue teleworking into 2029.",
      "During remarks at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump blamed the Biden administration for what he said was a \"terrible\" and \"ridiculous\" agreement that would allow tens of thousands of federal workers to continue working from home several days a week.",
      "The president-elect said \"it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it.\" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.",
      "\"If people don't come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed,\" said Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term Jan. 20.",
      "Work-from-home policies for the federal workforce have come under scrutiny by the leaders of Trump's newly created Department of Government Efficiency, billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have said they are looking to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget.",
      "\"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don't want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn't pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month.",
      "Musk then claimed on social media earlier this month that \"almost no one\" who is employed by the government works in-person, leading to \"thousands of empty buildings not just in America, but around the world, paid for with your tax dollars!\"",
      "In his remarks from Mar-a-Lago, Trump appeared to be referencing an agreement reached by the Social Security Administration and the American Federation of Government Employees earlier this month. The deal keeps in place the agency's current telework policy until October 2029.",
      "Under the plan, employees must be in the office between two and five days per week, depending on their jobs, according to Bloomberg News. There are roughly 42,000 Social Security Administration workers who are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees.",

An August report from the Office of Management and Budget found that as of May, about 54% work every day in roles that aren't eligible for telework.

      "\"In the first term, everyone was fighting me,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"This time, everyone wants to be my friend.\"",
      "According to a source at Google, the company donated $285,000 to Biden's inaugural fund four years ago. Google has not announced plans, so far, to donate to Trump's. The Information, a tech news site, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, had plans to meet with Trump.",
      "Tech company CEOs have been going to see Trump at Mar-a-Lago after years of watching his tone and stance change, or at least soften, after in-person meetings.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Trump recently, Trump said.",
      "Trump told CNBC in a Thursday interview that Bezos would visit him \"next week.\" Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which declined to endorse a candidate in this year's presidential election, breaking with the paper's past precedent. \"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,\" Bezos wrote at the time.",
      "Trump's relationship with social media and tech companies has, in the past, been tenuous if not downright hostile.",
      "During Trump's first term in the White House, he frequently blasted Bezos and Amazon, accusing the company of \"doing great damage\" to retailers and hurting \"towns, cities and states throughout the U.S.\" He's insisted that Amazon should pay more for U.S. Postal Service deliveries.",
      "But Trump has dialed back his public hostility toward the company, and Bezos \u2014 who previously said Trump's treatment of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and refusal to accept the election results in 2020 \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" \u2014 has softened, too.",
      "Speaking at a New York Times DealBook Summit recently, Bezos said he's \"very optimistic\" about a second Trump term.",
      "\"What I've seen so far is he is calmer than he was the first time and more settled,\" Bezos said. \"You've probably grown in the last eight years. He has, too.\"",
      "Both X (which was called Twitter at the time) and Facebook prohibited Trump from posting to their platforms after hundreds of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump did little to try to stop them. Musk reinstated Trump's X account in November 2022 after taking over the company, although Trump has largely posted to his own social media platform, Truth Social. Facebook and Instagram restored Trump's accounts\u00a0in early 2023.",
      "Tech CEOs weren't so eager to donate to Trump's first inaugural committee after his 2016 victory.",
      "For Trump's 2017 inauguration, which raised an eye-popping $107 million, his biggest donors were largely affiliated with sports teams, casinos, venture capital firms and banks. His most generous donor, at $5 million, was the late Las Vegas Sands founder Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021. But, other than GoDaddy.com founder Bob Parsons, the leaders of big-name tech companies weren't giving $1 million to Trump the first time around.",
      "Trump's inaugural committee, officially known as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc., is a nonprofit 501(c)(4) entity that's responsible for planning inaugural events, and can accept limitless donations. Trump allies former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and investor Steve Witkoff are the committee's co-chairs. When he announced his inaugural committee and co-chairs, Trump said the committee will \"honor\" the \"magnificent victory\" he and his team had to kick off his administration.",
      "Inaugural committees add the pomp and circumstance to an inauguration, but not at taxpayers' expense. They also offer a way for donors to curry favor with an incoming administration. Donors who give $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee can expect not only tickets but face-time with the incoming president and vice president, as well as Cabinet officials.",
      "A president-elect's inaugural committee is different from the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, established by Congress, which is underwritten by taxpayers. The congressional committee, composed of members of both parties, plans and carries out the swearing-in ceremony, as well as an inaugural luncheon for the president and vice president at the Capitol.",
      "The presidential committee is responsible for all events other than those taking place at the Capitol.",

    "summary": "A commercial real estate company has crowned Milan's Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
    "story": [
      "Shoppers laden with bags from Fendi, Loewe, Prada and other designer labels clog the narrow sidewalks of Milan's swankiest shopping street, bringing joy to the purveyors of high-end luxury goods this, and every, holiday season.",
      "There's even more to celebrate this year: A commercial real estate company has crowned Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",
      "A few store windows down, Franca Da Rold, who was visiting Milan from Belluno, an Italian city in the Dolomites mountain range, marveled at a chunky, meters-long knit scarf priced at 980 euros ($1,028).",
      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the accounting and advisory firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

      "Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.",
      "This year's crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year's entrance of into the public domain of Mickey Mouse. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\"It's a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons - he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\" said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke's Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \"There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\"",
      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

    "story": [
      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",

      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",

      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",

      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",

      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them.

    "story": [

This bold move highlights the escalating tensions between the two nations as they grapple with potential trade conflicts.",
      "\"We will go to the full extent depending how far this goes. We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy, going down to Michigan, going down to New York State and over to Wisconsin,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said during a press conference following a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other provincial premiers to discuss Trump's tariff threat. \"I don't want this to happen, but my No. 1 job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians and Canadians as a whole since we're the largest province.\"",
      "Trump in November threatened to impose a blanket 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico unless the two countries take action to curb the flow of drugs and unauthorized migrants to the U.S.",
      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",

      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",

Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

Connolly, who came to Congress in 2009, will replace Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who will serve as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3.",

      "While Democrats will remain in the minority in the new year, Connolly's elevation to ranking member places him in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President-elect Donald Trump's second term.

He followed through with that threat later Monday morning, records show, filing against the newspaper in Polk County, Iowa.",
      "Trump complained at the press conference that the pollster, J. Ann Selzer, \"said I was going to lose by three or four points,\" after previous Iowa surveys showed he'd win the state easily, \"by 20 points.\" Trump won the state by 13 points.",

      "\"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\" Anton said.",

      "Ever booked a hotel room for $200 only to be surprised by an extra $40 \"resort fee\" at checkout? A new Federal Trade Commission rule aims to put a stop to such surprise charges by banning so-called junk fees on short-term lodging as well as on tickets to live events.",
      "The rule bans businesses from using such tactics to disguise prices and mislead customers who rent short-term lodging, such as hotels and vacation homes, along with consumers who buy tickets to concerts, sports and other live events, the FTC announced Tuesday.",
      "\"People deserve to know upfront what they're being asked to pay \u2014 without worrying that they'll later be saddled with mysterious fees that they haven't budgeted for and can't avoid,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"The FTC's rule will put an end to junk fees around live event tickets, hotels and vacation rentals, saving Americans billions of dollars and millions of hours in wasted time.\"",
      "Under the new rule, total prices for short-term lodging and event tickets must be presented to consumers in a \"timely, transparent and truthful\" manner, the FTC said. That's meant to ensure people are longer surprised by extra charges including \"resort,\" \"convenience\" or \"service\" fees that inflate prices. It's also designed to make comparing costs easier, according to the agency.",
      "Hotels commonly tack on resort fees to cover costs like cleaning or the use of amenities such as fitness or aquatic centers. But the FTC said such fees are deceptive, estimating that the new rule will save consumers both time and billions of dollars.",
      "To be sure, businesses may still charge additional fees for service, but they must disclose such charges to consumers up-front, rather than burying them in fine print, and \"clearly and conspicuously\" advertise a hotel room or live event ticket's total price including all fees, versus simply displaying a base rate or price, the FTC explained. The total cost also must be displayed more prominently than any other pricing information, the rule stipulates.",
      "Longstanding consumer protection laws prohibit business in other industries from deceiving consumers about fees and pricing.",
      "President Biden weighed in on the FTC's action banning hidden junk fees Tuesday, saying he's prioritized lowering costs for American families.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders have yet to unveil their plan to keep the government funded through the spring, prompting concerns about thwarting a shutdown before a Friday night deadline.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly said that the stopgap funding measure's release was imminent in recent days, said Tuesday morning that he expected to the text of what's known as a continuing resolution would be made public by the end of the day. The bill would maintain current funding levels until March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "\"The CR is coming together, bipartisan work is ongoing,\" Johnson said. \"We're almost there.\"",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" have occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",
      "\"What would have been a very skinny, very simple clean CR, these other pieces have been added to it,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline in the continuing resolution.",
      "On the timing of the measure to keep the government funded this week, the speaker said he believes in adhering to rule that gives members 72 hours to review legislation before it's brought to the floor, which would push a vote on the stopgap measure until Friday. And he said House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers on the party's right flank have already expressed opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year.",
      "The frustration comes as Johnson faces a referendum on his job performance in a matter of weeks, with the chamber set to vote to elect a speaker in the new year.",
      "\"Everybody knows we have difficult circumstances,\" Johnson said, when asked about how the funding fight could weigh on the speaker vote. \"We're doing the very best we can under those circumstances.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction in state court remains on the books Monday, after a New York judge rejected an effort by Trump to have the case tossed based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan found that a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts did not preclude a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan wrote that evidence shown at trial pertained \"entirely to unofficial conduct,\" beyond the scope of the Supreme Court's ruling, which he described as narrow.",
      "\"If error occurred regarding the introduction of the challenged evidence, such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said at the time he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Since then, Trump filed another motion to dismiss the case, arguing that his forthcoming return to the White House required it.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have fought that effort, saying there's no law that requires dismissing a state case after conviction because the defendant was elected to the presidency.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "A unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The nation's highest court said in that decision that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and the indictment thrown out. They argued that his trial included testimony from former White House staff that should have been barred.",
      "Bragg's office said in opposing the motion to dismiss that the testimony called into question was, \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence in the case.",
      "Merchan wrote in his ruling that Trump's lawyers failed to object during the trial to testimony it considered improperly admitted.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies in authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "\"Is a President's in-office conduct to conceal payments to an adult film actress to keep information from the public eye relating to an encounter that occurred prior to his Presidency official or unofficial?\" Merchan asked at one point in his ruling. He concluded they were unofficial acts, but later added, even if they hadn't been, \"use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger\" to the presidency.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denies Daniels' story. Trump has promised to appeal the conviction. He is separately able to appeal Merchan's ruling on presidential immunity.",

      "It's largely a ceremonial vote, the next step after the presidential election. When Americans cast their ballots on Election Day, they're technically voting for a slate electors committed to supporting their choice for president and vice president.",
      "How does the Electoral College work?",
      "The rules governing the\u00a0Electoral College are outlined\u00a0by the 12th Amendment.",
      "Presidential electors, according to the amendment, \"shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify.\"",
      "The political parties choose the slate of electors ahead of the general election.",
      "After Election Day, all the votes are counted and then certified by each state. According to the 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act, the deadline to certify the results is set at six days before the electors are scheduled to meet, traditionally on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December.",
      "The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 also requires that each state determine a state official \u2014 the governor unless specified otherwise \u2014 to be responsible for submitting the \"certificate of ascertainment\" that identifies the state's electors and includes a security feature.",
      "What were the 2024 Electoral College results?",
      "Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris' 226. See state-by-state results here and below.",
      "Nationally, Trump also won the popular vote, winning 77.2 million votes to Harris' 75 million.",
      "How many electoral votes does each state have?",
      "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 is needed to become president.",
      "Each state's electoral votes are equal to the number of representatives they have in the House, plus two senators.",
      "While the number of Electoral College votes has remained at 538 since 1964, the number of votes per state changes to match congressional apportionment after the decennial census. Between the 2020 election and the 2024 election, Texas gained two Electoral College votes, while five other states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon \u2014 gained one electoral vote each. Six states lost an electoral vote: California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.",
      "The map below shows the changes by state between the 2020 election and the 2024 election.",
      "Does each elector have to vote with the state election results?",
      "Forty-eight states and Washington, D.C., are winner-take-all, so the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the state's electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors based on the winner of the popular vote within each Congressional District and then two \"at-large\" electors are determined based on winner of the statewide popular vote.",
      "The electors are supposed to vote in accordance with the outcome of the popular vote in their state. The Constitution does not require electors to vote with the winner of the popular vote, but most states have laws that nullify the votes of \"faithless electors.\" The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that states can punish these \"faithless electors.\"",
      "According to FairVote, there have been 90 \"deviant\" votes cast by electors for president since the founding of the Electoral College, although the majority of these were due to the death of a party's nominee rather than a true deviation from the voters' intent.",
      "There have also been 75 faithless electors for vice president, for a total of 165 faithless electors throughout history, according to FairVote.",
      "After the 2020 election, so-called \"fake\"\u00a0Republican electors in seven battleground states won by President Biden met anyway and cast phony votes for Trump. State criminal charges have been filed against fake electors in Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. In charging Trump for attempting the overturn the election results, special counsel Jack Smith said these fake electors were part of a plan to overturn the election, orchestrated by pro-Trump attorneys with Trump's support. Those charges\u00a0have been dismissed since Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "What's next after the Electoral College certification?",
      "After the results are signed and certified, they are sent to Harris, acting as the president of the Senate. The vote certificates must be received by the fourth Wednesday in December, which this year is Dec. 25. The archivist then transmits the sets of certificates to Congress on or before the new Congress meets on Jan. 3, 2025.",
      "On Jan. 6, 2025, Congress meets in a joint session to count the Electoral College votes, overseen by Harris. After the votes are counted, the vice president announces the winner of the election.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance will take the oath of office at the inauguration at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.",

We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.\"",
      "Trump made his comments in a lengthy exchange with reporters Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Drone sightings in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and other states along the East Coast have sparked concern from local officials who want answers about the drones, some of which have been located near military installations.",
      "\"The government knows what is happening,\" Trump claimed, although the extent of the government's knowledge is unknown. \"Look, our military knows where they took off from. If it's a garage, they can go right into that garage. They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is. our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.\"",
      "Trump said he \"can't imagine it's the enemy\" behind the drones. He also said the drone sightings are near his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, where he often spends the warmer months.",
      "\"For some reason, they don't want to tell the people, and they should,\" he continued. \"Because the people are really, I mean, they happen to be over Bedminster. They're very close to Bedminster. I think maybe I won't spend the weekend in Bedminster. I've decided to cancel my trip.\"",

      "Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. and create 100,000 jobs in artificial intelligence and technology, President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday at Mar-a-Lago alongside SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.",
      "\"Today, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum,\" Trump said, adding that Son was announcing the investment \"because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election.\"",
      "The investment \"will help insure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created right here in the U.S.A.,\" Trump said.",
      "\"I\"m very, very excited,\" Son said. \"I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump. And my confidence level to the economy of the United States has tremendously increased with his victory.\"",
      "During their announcement, Trump asked Son to double the investment.",
      "\"I'm going to ask him right now, will you make it $200 billion, believe it or not, he can actually afford to do that,\" Trump said. Son responded, \"With your leadership and my parternship and your support, I will try to make it happen.\"",

The venture was forecast to employ more than 10,000 people, bringing high-paying tech jobs to the Midwestern state.",
      "Trump heralded the major tech partnership as \"transformational\" and the \"eighth wonder of the world.\" But seven years later, that vision has \u2014 so far \u2014 failed to flourish. Foxconn did build a small plant on the site, but far smaller than the one Trump and Foxconn initially announced.",
      "In 2019, the campus was scaled back to a \"research hub\" that employed far fewer people than initially promised. The effort instead ended up employing about 1,000 workers,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin, for its part,\u00a0said\u00a0in 2020 it would scale back its promise of billions in tax credits, given that Foxconn had failed to deliver on its original plan.",
      "Meanwhile, another major tech company \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 stepped in to fill some of the gap left by Foxconn. In 2024, Microsoft\u00a0said\u00a0it would build a $3.3 billion data center on on 315 acres adjacent to where Foxconn had planned to construct its campus. Microsoft expects its first building on its new Wisconsin site to be completed in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President-elect Trump promises big change for America's role in the world. But with much of the world on fire, will his policies extinguish the flames or fuel them?",
      "Mr. Trump's traveling transition team didn't have far to go for the annual Army-Navy Game. This year, it was just outside Washington. The game gave his national security picks the opportunity to review and cheer on some of our future troops.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ (R-Florida): We love our Navy, except today.",
      "FORMER REPRESENTATIVE TULSI GABBARD (D-Hawaii): Go, Army. Beat Navy.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Go, Army. Beat Navy.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unfortunately for them, Navy won.",
      "And some of Trump's intended nominees will face a tough path to victory themselves. But one man who's definitely headed for a job in the White House, incoming National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, will join us to preview the new administration's priorities amid instability throughout the Middle East, tensions in Asia and an unrelenting war in Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, will also be here. We will ask how new leadership in Washington will change her own country's calculus, as Russia's invasion grinds on.",
      "Then: President Biden breaks a record by commuting the sentences of 1,500 Americans. We will ask Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar about that and the future of law enforcement under Trump.",
      "Plus: Donald Trump promises Wall Street big changes are ahead.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States (R) and Current U.S. President-Elect): We're going to do things, I think, that haven't been really done before. We're going to be cutting taxes still further.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will dive into the details with IBM vice chairman Gary Cohn, who served as a top economic aide to Trump during his first term.",
      "And, finally, a conversation with the head of the United Nations' World Food Program, Cindy McCain, about the link between global hunger and global instability.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Congress and the Biden administration are rushing to get business wrapped up during this last workweek of the year for lawmakers before the former and president-elect takes the oath of office in January.",
      "We begin with Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, who is the incoming White House national security adviser.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ (R-Florida): Morning, Margaret.",
      "Tough day for Army, but great day for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well, as a Green Beret, I know you had a reason to be cheering there for Army, sir.",
      "I want to ask you a number of topics, but, before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department.",
      "And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and \u2013 and it's \u2013 it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here.",
      "And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is \u2013 is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced.",
      "We need to know who's behind it. But, right now, I think law enforcement seems to be \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So, when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low-level, long-loitering, could-be-dangerous drones?",
      "And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following prepositioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore.",
      "And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to have an all-of-the-above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Let \u2013 let me ask you about China. The president-elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been talking and discussing, as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping.",
      "CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back-and-forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing.",
      "I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So, the outreach has been tremendous.",
      "President Trump is taking all calls. As you know, he believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head-of-state level. And those conversations \u2013 those conversations are ongoing, but they are really nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties.",
      "We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but, as I have said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans.",
      "Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated.",
      "You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are \u2013 we have been over the years trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber.",
      "We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation-state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that, even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.",
      "That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And then, finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is this sanctions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one.",
      "But taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar-a-Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself.",
      "He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orban seems to be floating a Christmas cease-fire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orban has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump.",
      "And I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in Eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 this is World War I-style \u2013 this is World War I-style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings.",
      "President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of cease-fire as a first step, again, we'll \u2013 we'll take a hard look at what that means.",
      "But, until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so no message was sent through Orban to Putin by Trump? Is that \u2013 that's what I understand you saying there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to \u2013 yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of back-and-forths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: But one is talking. Of course, we're going to continue to talk. And President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check \u2013 in his interview with \"TIME\" magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't \u2013 you know, just isn't a strategy, this just kind of forever war that we seem to be backing into.",
      "What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table? And what's the framework for \u2013 for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45-minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know, what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to \u2013 that framework I just talked about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just \u2013 not just a pause?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Those are all things that we're thinking through.",
      "And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO secretary-general came here to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: He's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in \u2013 whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East.",
      "During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014.",
      "President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. Thousands of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're, importantly, taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And, you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained.",
      "So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And we'll see moving forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Mike Waltz, thank you for joining us today.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Great to be back on, Margaret. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",
      "I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A man who committed tax fraud\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: It reminded me, isolation prison in Denesk, which still is operational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: So, look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it at any time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",

And just like that, the fear of saying something that might get you arrested was gone. The Islamist fighters who had seized power a week ago were partying, too. In the main suuk (ph), shoppers walked on Assad's face. While at Saydnaya Prison, where his critics were tortured and killed, crowds poured in to what Syrians used to call the slaughterhouse.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme): Well, our deliveries so far have been very - very smooth. But we need more delivery options open, which is what this was eluding to.",
      "More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this - this month so far, but we need more. And - and, more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking.",
      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game. And you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide.",
      "Have you seen any change to that?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of need you're looking for. Seventeen billion is the number you are asking for.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and first Trump administration economic adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary, and we're back now with the Vice Chairman of IBM Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House Economic Advisor in President Trump's first term. Gary, welcome back. It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the President's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN: \u00a0 Margaret, thanks for having me. You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7% on consumer prices. Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2%, so we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2% where the Fed would like to get to. That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly- it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points. Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 So the President's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth, we have real wage growth. And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year. Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation. So the economy the President's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive. Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that will actually happen?",
      "COHN: I do think it's going to happen. So net, net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark. It's a- it's an index, it's a benchmark. And remember, the stock market is an index. There's a- there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end that are performing very, very well, and there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn. Gary, before the break, you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So you helped put together the tax plan that's expiring in 20- or part of it expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21%. He really wanted to get it back down to 15 and \"we will be able to do that.\" Will he be able to do that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it. When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time in 2025, you are given instructions by the- by the Budget Committee, They instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you could take in. This time, it will be how much money you can spend. We did not have additional money to spend, so the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21%. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation in 2017 expires the end of 2025, to score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025. So we do know that taxes will be taken up by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation, because if not, the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code. That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants, on either side of the aisle, wants to go back to the prior tax code. You know, when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side, because the vast majority of companies in the United States are small businesses that file on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate, and you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of out of- out of line with each other, so people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter S corporation versus a corporation, so they can take advantage of the tax code. So there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I think you've said in the past, though you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, the business community as a whole, when we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the Business Roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21% tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23% or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN::: Other developed economies.",
      "COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically, we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domiciled companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The pick for Treasury Secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, social security, overtime pay. Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look, Scott is quite an accomplished individual. So look, I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies. There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these promises--",
      "COHN: I agree with that, but we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy, continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you heard the House Speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote. They're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, and do it in kind of an arcane way. When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and I don't know, this could change anyway, there's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy on this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority, budget-related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill, which is border related, where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration, and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes?",
      "COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there, as there were in the Biden administration, use that to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's a big fight to have in the year ahead. Gary, we will be talking to you again, then. We've got to take a break. Thank you."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be back on Margaret, thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record and you actually co-sponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them. Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this, and why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency and three, I appreciated some of the Congressman's words, because what he is talking about is we need to have a new regulatory rules in place here. Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities, and then we've got to figure out, do we really want all these drones, because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future, and they have to be within 400 feet, so these things are going to be what? Flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these. So I think I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be. No one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Republican controlled Senate?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on. You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration, and you'll get to question his selectee to run the FBI Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution. I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI: The approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line-up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record, as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees. Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice. She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So we have to do our due diligence and make decisions. I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency, and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here. And so when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied- he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity. And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission when we should be on a national security safety mission here, when we look at cyber security attacks that you just talked to the congressman about and various other things. He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them, but in the end, it's their decision to demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own. I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1500 Americans more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so called \"Cash for kids\" scheme\u2013",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I did not like that one. Nope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013that sent thousands to jail for millions of dollars, a man who committed tax fraud at a cost of more than $1.6 billion described as \"the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepented tax cheat in U.S. history,\" a woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare. Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles was also commuted. So the way I look at is this- I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son. I also have not agreed with a number of pardons that President Trump gave. So I believe, and I've long advocated for this, that while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that right? Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the army, things like that. That's been going on a long time, but we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House. This makes no sense to me\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category and not the specifics of the case. Was that prudent?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so, I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group. Okay, let's say that. Now I believe that there were, but there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So instead of doing a whole category, why don't in a coming year before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these, that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them based on the facts, instead of just in a large group. So large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just, I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because otherwise you undermine the justice system. And again, I emphasize, this also happened in a big way under President Trump, and you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more face than nation. Stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, Trump's pick for national security adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, who is the incoming White House National Security Adviser. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Morning. Margaret. Tough day for Army, but great day for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well as a Green Beret, I know you had a reason to be cheering there for Army, Sir. I want to ask you a number of topics, but before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department. And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and- and it's- it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is- is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced. We need to know who's behind it. But right now, I think law enforcement seems to be- the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low level, long loitering, could-be-dangerous drones? And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following pre-positioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore. And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles. We need to have an all of the above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Let- let me ask you about China. The President Elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been \"talking and discussing,\" as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping. CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back and forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing. I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So the outreach has been tremendous. President Trump is taking all calls, as you know. He believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head of state level. And those conversations- those conversations are ongoing, but they are, really, nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties. We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but as I've said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans. Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated. You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ\u00a0 I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are- we have been, over the years, trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber. We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense. The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point. And then finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is this sanctions?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: \u2014us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one, but taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off, is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar a Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself. He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n seems to be floating a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump, and I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style-",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings. President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll- we'll take a hard look at what that means. But until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no message was sent through Orb\u00e1n to Putin by Trump. Is that- that's what I understand you saying there.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to- yeah, I'm not going to get into specifics of back and forths. But, one is talking, of course, we're going to continue to talk, and the- President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check, in his interview with Time magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't- you know, just isn't a strategy. This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into. What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what's the framework for- for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45 minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to- that framework I just talked about. How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just- not just a pause? Those are all things that we're thinking through. And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO Secretary General came here to Mar a Lago, he's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in- whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East. During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014. President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. 1000s of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're importantly taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody. And you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term, and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained. So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration, and we'll see moving forward.",

      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, you are looking at a globe very much in crisis, but I want to start on the hot spot of Syria. USAID said the World Food Programme was able to reach 70,000 people in Syria over the last week, but you need supply lines to remain open. Is there a threat right now to your deliveries? And if so, where is that coming from?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, our deliveries so far have been very- very smooth, but we need more delivery options open, which is what this was alluding to. More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this- this month so far, but we need more. And- and more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking. We had- there's a lot of people, a lot of hunger at stake, a lot of malnutrition that was already pre-existing, that now- that now we need to handle as well. You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there, but now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get, not just more trucks, but more people in, so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you need Turkey to open up supply lines or surrounding countries? Is that right?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, correct. We need everybody around us, Turkey, all the countries surrounding us, to make sure that we can get in and get in smoothly, again, unfettered and, of course, in a safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you're trying to scale up to reach nearly 3 million people who need some help right now. The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "MCCAIN: Not really. We've- we've been able to, as- as you said, we've been able to move our goods, through, our food items, etc, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But- but I don't- I will never understate- underestimate the process with things that it could infringe us later on. So I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods again in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed. And that's the most important part that we need too, we need access, and we need the ability to feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now, if you want to know the truth. There's so much, there's so many- many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings. No one's paying any attention to it. Syria being one of them. And we need- we need, obviously, a great deal of funds in- in particular within Syria, but in other countries too. You're talking about Sudan, we're talking about Yemen, we're talking about Ethiopia and other places where- where people are desperate right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah. Countries are- are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing- choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. We- you know, we- I always send out the oral plea to be able to- to encourage people and encourage countries to be- to get involved and to stay involved. And I'm asking now, I'm asking on your show, worldwide, to please consider, once again, giving to Syria, because people in Syria will starve to death without it, and- and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations, and you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game, and you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide. Have you seen any change to that?",
      "MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now, and hunger- hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide, and it does affect national security. So it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S., as- as we just said, the most generous here, the president-elect has selected a rising star in the Republican Party, Elise Stefanik, to be the representative at the United Nations, and also a cabinet member. That indicates an important voice at the table. Congressman Stefanik- Congresswoman Stefanik called for a complete reassessment of U.S. funding for the United Nations. Are you concerned that you will see a negative impact on funding?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm not concerned, because when I came into this job, I knew that funding was not going to be at the level that it had been. So we've gone through a complete- complete reboot on not only scaling down our operations and making sure that we're more efficient, more effective, and- and making sure that our people in- we push everything to this- to the- to the field now, so that our people in the field can get the job done. We- this was something I came in knowing I was going to have to do, is scale down, make sure that- that we work better, more efficiently, more effectively, and make sure that we get food to the people that need it the most in a quick and safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We- right now, we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly, Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where- where famine does exist, as you know, it's been declared there. And we need- we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can- can access from that direction as well. It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in, but we need more. People are starving to death, and once again, it's- it's- I sound like a broken record, but we need to be able to get in in a safe and unfettered- unfettered manner, so that we can get the job done. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that because if people are insecure from a food- from- from a food reality, they're not going to behave well, and things- they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this. The countries that are affected right now, and the big ones that we- that we look to, are all affected because of conflict. It's- the food security issue is- is very directly caused by conflict within the arena that they're in. So it's very important that we pay attention to that particular issue as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Given the- the scale of the famine and the malnutrition in Sudan, is it food that you're trying to bring in, or is it more, you know, specialized medical assistance? How do you deal with the children, for example, who are being so hurt in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, yes, part of that is making sure that- that our folks from UNICEF, our folks from W.H.O. can get in because there are specialized and- specialized products that are needed for, especially the infants, that are so severely- severely malnourished. And it's our job to help not just get our stuff in, but get their stuff in as well, in any way that we can. We're a team player in all this, and we make sure that we- we access and talk to all of our partners within the field so that we can work together. Yes. I mean, these are these- these people, and these children especially, have been so deprived of nourishment for so long that they need highly-specialized items to be able- to be able to beat malnutrition and at least have some chance at life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's- what's going on. Listen- this- we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know- and of course, now we're into December. But so- the- the- the inability for us to not only to- to move our trucks and get it to where it needs to go, but the insecurity that's caused from it, the- the- the targeting of- of humanitarian aid workers and making sure that we can't move or that- or that they feel insecure. This whole- this whole issue of not being able to get in, is- is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire, and we need it now. We can't- there's- we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of- of crowds just crushing people, amassing at bakeries in Gaza. 90% of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is man-made.",
      "MCCAIN: It is man-made, you're- you're absolutely right. It is man-made and and- and more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just- not just do they need food, but we need access. And the targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job, and- and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. Children, especially, are starving to death. I mean, the height of malnutrition, the height of- of hunger within- within that region, is- is unbelievably horrible, and so we've seen it firsthand. And I- I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are- I'm calling for a cease-fire, and I want my aid, my fellow partners within this arena, to call for the same thing. We need a cease-fire. We need access, and we need it now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You used the word--",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 -- Again, remember, food security is national security, and that's what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running, if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the- the lawlessness. There is absolutely no- no law- law to be held, you know, to be even talked about there, because it doesn't exist. And so we need all of those kinds of things to be put into place so that we can work in a safe manner and get- get the food to where it's go- where it needs to go. Again, we've gotten two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of needs. You're looking for 17 billion is the number you are asking for. We wish you good luck feeding the world.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good to have you back with us.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No Western Power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelensky said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, so and we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support. Yesterday, we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the word about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already, and we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look we we see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions. So it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this axis of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kursk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in Modern Warfare, and they're learning in Ukraine- I mean, right there.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this and Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raised the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military Recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up this fight?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have, first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine, and they are volunteering, and women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces. With the recruitment, the last changes to the law on mobilization already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on, so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Korean to unprepared Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us, because every person matters for Ukrainians. Of course there are challenges, and we have the plan and we know how to do it, because again, this is our home we are defending. So when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country, but weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3000 Glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us.",
      "There's missiles for both Russian and North Korean missiles. I mean, it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone. But Donald Trump gave an interview to Time Magazine, and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons- missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, let me say, start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually, to provide us with lethal aid in the first place\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013back in 2017.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes. So right now, we have to do everything in order to stop Russia. And we know it's- it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50% that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea, just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could, they- we can stop them the more equipment we have, especially including the longer range equipment in order to be able to degrade the attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table, because, again, Ukraine wants peace. Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict, and we negotiated at the first sign- remember, in 2022 when Russians started negotiations, they, of course, did not negotiate peace. They negotiated the pause. As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be but we do know that Viktor Orban was at Mar-a-Lago this past week, and he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter, after Russia destroyed our- a lot of our energy infrastructure. And after you know, we are going through this difficult fights, both on the front line, but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Just this past week.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, at the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying, and we see they were not able to defend their body- terrorist body Assad, and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Sednaya Prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere. It reminded me isolation prison in Donetsk\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Which still is operational. So look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it anytime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",
      "With the bright moon on peak night, an observer in the U.S. may see around 15 Geminids an hour, Cooke said.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "The Geminid meteor shower is visible around the world and throughout the night sky. For optimal viewing conditions, head somewhere far away from city and street lights, then lie down flat on your back with your feet pointed south. Give your eyes half an hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "NASA advises bringing a sleeping bag or blanket to help with the cold while waiting for the Geminids.",

      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",

      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

During the trial, Momeni's lawyers\u00a0claimed that their client acted in self-defense, alleging that Lee lunged at Momeni with a knife in his hand while high on ketamine and cocaine. The defense\u00a0said Lee became erratic and aggressive after Momeni made a \"bad joke\"\u00a0at the expense of Lee's family.",

      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",

      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

    "title": "How TikTok could avoid being banned in the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:52:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The TikTok ban is set to go into effect next month barring a last-minute sale or Supreme Court action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok's fate in the U.S. appears to be hanging by a thread after a federal appeals court denied its plea to delay a law that will ban the widely popular app if it does not cut ties with its Chinese parent company ByteDance.",
      "The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 19, gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok. Absent a sale, the app will be cut off from app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay if a sale is in progress.",
      "According to experts, TikTok has several pathways for avoiding a ban, most notably intervention from the Supreme Court or the incoming Trump administration declining to enforce it. Other options, like a last-minute sale or Congress deciding to repeal the law, appear less likely.",
      "TikTok turns to the Supreme Court",
      "On Monday, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to temporarily pause the law, arguing the appeals court's decision upholding it was \"utterly antithetical to the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"If the Act is allowed to take effect in January 2025 \u2026 this Court will lose its ability to grant applicants meaningful relief,\" lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance wrote. \"Even a temporary shutdown of TikTok will cause permanent harm to applicants \u2014 a representative group of Americans who use TikTok to speak, associate, and listen \u2014 as well as the public at large.\"",
      "The Supreme Court could grant an injunction temporarily blocking the law while TikTok's appeal plays out, saving the app for the time being.",
      "The justices will also need to decide whether to hear the case once TikTok formally requests they do so. If they decline, the appeals court's ruling would be the final say on the matter, and the ban would go into effect, barring intervention by the president. If the high court takes the case, the injunction would almost certainly be in place \u2014 and thus the ban on hold \u2014 until the justices hear and decide the dispute. That process would likely take months.",
      "TikTok asked the justices to make a decision on its request for an injunction by Jan. 6 so that it can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "The company said a sale is not an option at this point, but a prolonged legal battle before the Supreme Court could buy time to explore a deal. The Chinese government is opposed to selling TikTok's algorithm, meaning a new buyer would be forced to rebuild it from scratch. The algorithm tailors video recommendations to each user and is made up of millions of lines of code.",
      "In its ruling earlier this month, the panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the U.S. government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk as long as the Chinese government can use it to collect data on its 170 million users in the U.S. and covertly manipulate the content those users see on the platform. The appeals court rejected TikTok's bid for temporary pause on the ban last week.",
      "Alan Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, expects the Supreme Court to take up the case, but said TikTok is likely to face similar skepticism over its claims that the law violates the First Amendment. Morrison said an argument centered on a constitutional provision that prohibits \"bills of attainder\" could be more persuasive. A bill of attainder is legislation that punishes or targets a specific party without first going to trial.",
      "\"The bill of attainder was a much stronger claim than the First Amendment,\" said Morrison, who teaches constitutional law. \"Congress has decided what the new standard of the law is. It's decided who the defendant is \u2014 TikTok \u2014 and it's essentially adjudicated their guilt \u2014 guilt in a civil sense, not in a criminal sense \u2014 which is the mark of a bill of attainder.\"",
      "During oral arguments before the appeals panel in September, Judge Douglas Ginsburg pushed back on the notion that the law singles out TikTok, although it and ByteDance were the only companies named in the legislation. Ginsburg said the law \"describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity.\" He noted that TikTok and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns and it's \"the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "\"Maybe the Supreme Court will think differently,\" Morrison said.",
      "Trump and app stores could refuse to enforce a ban",
      "Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, said the incoming Trump administration could play a role in whether TikTok is banned.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts, vowed this year to \"save\" it. On Monday, Trump touted TikTok as playing a role in helping him with the youth vote and winning the 2024 election. He told reporters that he would \"take a look at TikTok\" when asked how he planned to stop the ban.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said. The same day, Trump met with TikTok's CEO Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate, sources familiar with the meeting told CBS News.",
      "Kreps said Trump has several options once he takes office on Jan. 20, the day after the law goes into effect.",
      "\"If [Trump] wants to save TikTok, he could ask Congress to repeal the ban. I don't think that's going to happen. He could ask the [Justice Department] not to enforce the law and signal to Apple and Google that they wouldn't be prosecuted. I don't think that's going to happen either,\" Kreps said. Android and iPhone users depend on the Google Play and Apple App Store to download apps, giving the tech giants a role in carrying out the ban.",
      "\"But what I think could happen is, all of these compliance issues take resources, so he could just simply not provide the resources to enforce the ban,\" Kreps said. \"I think there are ways bureaucratically he could try to massage this so that he's not overturning the ban, but he's also not strictly enforcing it.\"",
      "Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law once he's in office, although that move requires the president to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "A provision in the law that gives the president the power to determine whether an app is no longer controlled by a foreign adversary presents another potential workaround, according to Erik Stallman, a clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. The law says the president determines when the divestiture requirements are met, although it stipulates that the determination has to happen through an interagency process.",
      "\"Trump can say that he's satisfied that this U.S.-based entity that they've set up is sufficiently distinct from ByteDance to no longer require a divestiture,\" Stallman said.",
      "During its back and forth with the U.S. government over the years, TikTok created a U.S.-based subsidiary, TikTok U.S. Data Security Inc., to limit ByteDance's access to user data. The move was meant to alleviate national security concerns about user data and the Chinese government's access. It also gave responsibility to Oracle, a U.S. company, to store and protect U.S. user data. Lawmakers, however, viewed those protections as insufficient, and passed the law requiring its sale anyway.",
      "Even if the law isn't enforced by the Trump administration, Apple and Google could decide that it's not worth the risk to host TikTok in their app stores. Both companies are already involved in litigation with the Justice Department involving other matters. The TikTok legislation imposes hefty fines on companies found to be in violation, and Trump or his eventual successor could change their minds on enforcement.",
      "\"I think they want to be above board on the things that they have some clear-cut control over and this would be one of them,\" Kreps said of Apple and Google.",
      "Google declined to comment on its plans. Apple did not return a request for comment.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Apple and Google telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19. Though TikTok won't disappear from users' phones, app updates would no longer be available and those who don't already have TikTok would not be able to download it.",
      "Kreps expects TikTok users to migrate to other apps like Instagram and YouTube in the coming weeks if they haven't already. TikTok estimated that even a one-month shutdown would result in the platform losing a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "\"Every next step where they're blocked makes this more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Kreps said. \"The more people start to migrate, the more this ban has its intended effect, which is to move people elsewhere. But also as people move elsewhere, the impact of a ban actually is mitigated also.\"",

      "The top fundraising campaign on crowdfunding platform GoFundMe in 2024 reflects what has been a major pain point for millions of Americans: inflation.",
      "The company's annual giving\u00a0report shows that the number of fundraisers launched this year for people raising money to cover the cost of rent, food and other basic living expenses quadrupled compared to 2023. The proliferation of such campaigns reflects \"the way people have been struggling with prices that have risen over the past few years,\" GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the platform often mirrors societal needs, filling in the gaps where public programs have failed to cover Americans' essential costs.",
      "Other popular GoFundMe campaigns this year point to something that many consumers may not have needed so much as desperately wanted. For example, Taylor Swift fans flocked to the platform, with tens of thousands of \"Swifties\" raising and donating money to help buy tickets to the singer's Eras Tour shows, and in one case even funding a wedding so that a fan could avoid having to sell a guitar signed by Swift.",
      "The fastest growing category of fundraisers this year were tied to the 2024 Summer Olympics\u00a0in Paris, with a number of athletes launching campaigns to help defray travel and training expenses, or to fly their families overseas to see them compete.",
      "Vermont was ranked the most generous state in the U.S., and Ireland the most charitable country by donors per capita, according to GoFundMe. \"Vermont is famously community-oriented, it's a small state and a tight-knit state,\" Cadogan said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders have yet to unveil their plan to keep the government funded through the spring, prompting concerns about thwarting a shutdown before a Friday night deadline.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly said that the stopgap funding measure's release was imminent in recent days, said Tuesday morning that he expected to the text of what's known as a continuing resolution would be made public by the end of the day. The bill would maintain current funding levels until March 14, giving lawmakers more time to reach agreement on new spending bills when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate.",
      "\"The CR is coming together, bipartisan work is ongoing,\" Johnson said. \"We're almost there.\"",
      "The speaker said lawmakers have been \"working around the clock to get the CR done,\" noting that it was intended to be \"a very simple, very clean\" stopgap funding measure to get the party into the new year. But the Louisiana Republican said a \"couple of intervening things\" have occurred, citing the devastation caused by hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year. Johnson said the stopgap measure includes disaster relief that is \"critically important,\" and provides aid to farmers.",
      "\"What would have been a very skinny, very simple clean CR, these other pieces have been added to it,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johnson noted that House Republicans are aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline in the continuing resolution.",
      "On the timing of the measure to keep the government funded this week, the speaker said he believes in adhering to rule that gives members 72 hours to review legislation before it's brought to the floor, which would push a vote on the stopgap measure until Friday. And he said House Republican leadership is committed to passing the continuing resolution through the regular process, including by going through the House Rules Committee, where it's almost certain to face opposition from GOP hardliners that could further slow the path to passage.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers on the party's right flank have already expressed opposition to the stopgap measure. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican who sits on the Rules Committee, told reporters after the House GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning that \"this is not the process that we signed up for,\" saying lawmakers are supposed to be able to amend and debate key legislation on the House floor.",
      "\"We get this negotiated crap and we're forced to eat this crap sandwich,\" Roy said. \"Why? Because freaking Christmas is right around the corner. It's the same dang thing every year \u2014 legislate by crisis, legislate by calendar, not legislate because it's the right thing to do.\"",
      "Johnson has previously expressed distaste for large end-of-year funding measures known as omnibuses, and pledged to avoid the practice of pushing through spending before the holiday recess. He defended the continuing resolution Tuesday, saying \"it is not an omnibus\" and arguing that it will put the party in a position to \"put our fingerprints on what those final spending bills are\" in the new year.",
      "The frustration comes as Johnson faces a referendum on his job performance in a matter of weeks, with the chamber set to vote to elect a speaker in the new year.",
      "\"Everybody knows we have difficult circumstances,\" Johnson said, when asked about how the funding fight could weigh on the speaker vote. \"We're doing the very best we can under those circumstances.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Republicans wants to extend 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and could let ACA subsidies lapse to help pay the tab, according to analysts.",
    "story": [
      "The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, remains popular with the public, garnering the approval of 54% of U.S. adults, according to a recently released Gallup poll. But experts say that may not insulate the federal health insurance program from change as President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans look to renew $4 trillion in expiring tax cuts.",
      "Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u00a0(TCJA), a signature law passed during Trump's first term, are due to sunset at the end of 2025. Republican leaders are now strategizing on how to extend the cuts, while the president-elect has also pledged to slash corporate taxes and eliminate taxes on workers' tips and overtime pay.",
      "But renewing the TCJA tax breaks alone without reducing federal spending would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation's deficit through 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group focused on reducing the nation's debt.",
      "Trump has already taken two of the biggest government programs \u2014 Social Security and Medicare \u2014 off the table for potential cuts. Reduced defense spending is also viewed as unlikely, meaning nearly half of federal spending would be protected, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation,)\u00a0said\u00a0in a recent JAMA article.",
      "That leaves \"Medicaid, which is the next largest source of federal spending, and the ACA as prime targets for spending cuts. The math is inescapable,\" Levitt stated.",
      "Will Trump repeal the ACA?",
      "By contrast, an outright repeal of the ACA is unlikely. While Trump has continued to criticize the health care expansion measure, he has retreated from his previous vows to axe the ACA entirely.",
      "\"President Trump will deliver on his pledge to make his highly successful tax cuts permanent and ease the financial burden on families across the country. He will also end the drain on our health care system so that our country can continue to care for Americans who rely on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security,\" \u00a0Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News.",
      "Support for the ACA hit a record\u00a055%\u00a0in 2017, the first time a majority of Americans approved of the health care law since Gallup started asking about it in 2012. That high watermark came a month after failed efforts by then-President Trump and the GOP to repeal and replace the law.",
      "\"The Affordable Care Act is still politically divisive, but overall more popular with the public than ever,\" Levitt told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's unlikely Republicans will try to repeal the ACA again, but cuts to the ACA and Medicaid are quite possible if Republicans are looking to pay for tax cuts.\"",
      "Brad Ellis, senior director at Fitch Ratings, noted that Trump and Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in changing how the ACA operates, including introducing high-risk participant pools and possibly reducing subsidies for public exchange business. Such changes could hurt enrollment, he said in a recent report.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump said he had \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA.",
      "\"Obamacare stinks,\" Trump recently told NBC News' \"Meet the Press. \"If we come up with a better answer, I would present that answer to Democrats and to everybody else and I'd do something about it.\"",
      "Big cuts without lifting a finger",
      "Republicans can make big cuts to the ACA simply by standing pat. That's because enhanced ACA premium subsidies, which were enacted after President Biden was elected and the Democrats took control of Congress, are scheduled to lapse along with the 2017 tax cuts at the end of 2025. The drop in financial aid ACA enrollees would increase out-of-pocket premiums by an average of $705 a year, or 79%, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projects that letting the additional ACA subsidies expire would reduce the federal deficit by $335 billion over a decade, relative to extending them permanently.",
      "Enrollment in the ACA nearly doubled to a record 21 million after the enhanced subsidies went into effect. The CBO estimates that 6.9 million fewer people would be enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans without the subsidies, and 3.4 million more would be uninsured.",
      "The impact would be felt nationwide, but particularly in Southern states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the ACA, according to Levitt, who noted that the five states with the fastest growth in ACA enrollment since 2020 are Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.",
      "\"Health care was not a big topic during the campaign, so I can imagine that voters could be surprised to see cuts to Medicaid and the ACA that they didn't hear about during the campaign,\" Levitt said. \"As frustrated as people are with the current state of health insurance, disrupting the status quo makes them nervous.\"",
      "Medicaid a target for cuts?",
      "Medicaid accounts for more than $600 billion a year in federal spending and covers 81 million people, according to KFF.",
      "\"There are indications that support for Medicaid will decrease under the new administration, suggesting lower enrollment and revenue headwinds for this program,\" stated Fitch's Ellis.",
      "Trump was silent on Medicaid during the 2024 campaign, but his budget proposals during his first administration included a\u00a0plan to cap federal spending on Medicaid. The Project 2025 plan prepared by the Heritage Foundation and a coalition of conservative groups, is recommending changes to Medicaid including a limit on federal spending.",
      "\"The centerpiece of several prominent plans \u2014 Project 2025, the Republican Study Committee fiscal year 2025 (RSC) budget and the fiscal year 2025 House GOP budget resolution \u2014 is to cap and deeply cut federal Medicaid funding,\" Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's Center for Children and Families, noted in September.",
      "Trump sought distance himself from Project 2025 in the months leading up to the election, criticizing some of its policy proposal as \"abysmal.\"",
      "But Levitt said the ACA and Medicaid could still end up facing cuts as the Republicans, who will control the White House and both houses of Congress, hash out their fiscal plans after President-elect Trump assumes office.",
      "\"So much depends on whether there is pressure to pay for tax cuts with spending reductions. If Republicans are willing to cut taxes and increase the deficit, we may not see big cuts to the ACA and Medicaid,\" said Levitt. \"There are Republicans who may insist on spending cuts to offset tax cuts. If that's the case, the ACA and Medicaid are very likely to be on the chopping block.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's criminal conviction in state court remains on the books Monday, after a New York judge rejected an effort by Trump to have the case tossed based on a landmark Supreme Court ruling.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan found that a July Supreme Court ruling granting Trump presidential immunity for official acts did not preclude a jury from finding him guilty after a criminal trial this spring.",
      "Merchan wrote that evidence shown at trial pertained \"entirely to unofficial conduct,\" beyond the scope of the Supreme Court's ruling, which he described as narrow.",
      "\"If error occurred regarding the introduction of the challenged evidence, such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said at the time he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Since then, Trump filed another motion to dismiss the case, arguing that his forthcoming return to the White House required it.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have fought that effort, saying there's no law that requires dismissing a state case after conviction because the defendant was elected to the presidency.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "A unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts. The nation's highest court said in that decision that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and the indictment thrown out. They argued that his trial included testimony from former White House staff that should have been barred.",
      "Bragg's office said in opposing the motion to dismiss that the testimony called into question was, \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence in the case.",
      "Merchan wrote in his ruling that Trump's lawyers failed to object during the trial to testimony it considered improperly admitted.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies in authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "\"Is a President's in-office conduct to conceal payments to an adult film actress to keep information from the public eye relating to an encounter that occurred prior to his Presidency official or unofficial?\" Merchan asked at one point in his ruling. He concluded they were unofficial acts, but later added, even if they hadn't been, \"use of these acts as evidence of the decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger\" to the presidency.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denies Daniels' story. Trump has promised to appeal the conviction. He is separately able to appeal Merchan's ruling on presidential immunity.",

    "story": [
      "Rosie Clayburn is a descendant of the Yurok Tribe, which had its territory \u2014 called 'O Rew in the Yurok language \u2014 ripped from them nearly two centuries ago.",
      "\"As the natural world became completely decimated, so did the Yurok people,\" she said.",
      "That decimation started when miners rushed in for gold, killing and displacing tens of thousands of Native Americans in California and ravaging the redwood trees for lumber.",
      "\"Everything was extracted that was marketable,\" Clayburn said. \"We've always had this really intricate relationship with the landscape. We've hunted, we've fished, we've gathered. And those are all management tools. Everything that we do has been in balance with the natural world.\"",
      "Now, generations later, 125 acres bordering Redwood National and State Parks will be handed back to the Yuroks.",
      "The nonprofit Save the Redwoods League purchased the land in 2013 from an old timber mill, with the original goal of giving it to the National Park Service.",
      "\"As we continued conversations about the transfer of this land to the National Park Service, we began to realize that perhaps a better alternative would be to transfer the land back to the Yurok Tribe,\" said Save the Redwoods League's Paul Ringgold. \"No one knows this land better. They've been stewarding this land since time and memorial\"",
      "Ringgold said that stewardship includes controlled burns to clear dead vegetation \u2014 a native practice once outlawed, but now recognized as essential in preventing catastrophic wildfires.",
      "\"Indigenous populations have been using fire as a management tool,\" he said. \"We'd like to see that kind of practice return.\"",
      "Redwoods serve as some of the largest stores of carbon on the planet. A single tree can capture up to 250 tons in its lifetime, the equivalent of removing nearly 200 cars from the road for an entire year.",
      "But between logging and fires, 95% of California's redwoods have been destroyed. Over the past decade, the Yurok have been helping restore the land.",
      "Another forgotten jewel of the ecosystem is salmon. The fish were once so plentiful, they were eaten with most meals. The Yurok word for salmon even translates to \"that which we eat.\" But the salmon population has dwindled to about one-quarter of what it was 20 years ago, according to a coalition of state and federal agencies.",
      "The tribe is working to bolster the fish's population by building a stream channel, two connected ponds and about 20 acres of floodplain.",
      "\"You have salmon who provide for humans, but they also provide for other animals,\" Clayburn said. \"And then when they spawn and die, they put nutrients back in the ground. And so, everything just has this, this balance and this reciprocal way.\"",
      "That balance is returning. There's been a rebound in the salmon population and the Yuroks also recently reintroduced the California condor \u2014 a scavenger that's important to the ecosystem \u2014  back into the wild for the first time this century.",
      "\"It tells us that our land's healing and that our people are gonna heal,\" Clayburn said.",
      "The Yuroks will take full control of 'O Rew in 2026 and, in a first-of-its-kind partnership, receive help managing it from the Save the Redwoods League, California State Parks and The National Park Service.",
      "\"We understand some of the mistakes we made as a federal government, and it's a chance to begin that healing with the native tribes all across the United States,\" said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams.",
      "For Sams, the first Native American to lead the agency, the partnership is personal.",
      "\"We've been writing our histories separately. There's been the native history and then the American history. This is a chance when we're doing co-stewardship and co-management to write history together,\" he said.",
      "Of the 431 parks managed by the National Park Service, 109 of them now have formal co-stewardship agreements with indigenous tribes, with 43 more on the way.",
      "In addition to restoration work, plans for 'O Rew include the creation of new trails, the construction of a traditional Yurok village and a state-of-the-art visitor center. The visitor center will display Yurok artifacts and highlight the tribe's history and culture, with the goal of educating new visitors on the land's history and significance from the perspective of those who have lived on it the longest.",

    "title": "Ukraine claims blast that killed head of Russia's chemical weapons unit",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:38:45 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of Russia's chemical and biological forces, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, was killed in a Moscow bomb blast claimed by Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the Russian military's biological and chemical weapons unit, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, was killed along with his deputy early Tuesday in an explosion in Moscow, Russia's Investigative Committee said. Ukrainian security sources told CBS News the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) killed Kirillov in a special operation. The claim couldn't be independently verified, but Russian officials quickly vowed to take revenge against Ukraine's leaders.",
      "The sources said a scooter with explosives was detonated near Kirillov and his assistant outside an apartment building in the Russian capital. Video circulating online appeared to show the two men exiting a building right before an electric scooter parked near the entrance blew up.",
      "\"Kirillov was a war criminal and an absolutely legitimate target, since he gave orders to use prohibited chemical weapons against the Ukrainian military,\" an informed source in the SBU asserted to CBS News. \"Such an inglorious end awaits everyone who kills Ukrainians. Retribution for war crimes is inevitable.\"",
      "The deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said Ukraine's leaders would face imminent revenge for the killing, Russia's RIA news agency reported.",
      "The bomb was triggered remotely and had the power equivalent to roughly 300 grams of TNT, Russian state news agency Tass reported, citing unnamed sources in the emergency services.",
      "\"Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,\" said Svetlana Petrenko, a spokesperson for Russia's national Investigative Committee, in a statement. \"Investigative and search activities are being carried out to establish all the circumstances around this crime.\"",
      "She also said the Kremlin was treating it as a terrorist attack.",
      "Kirillov and the unit he headed have been sanctioned by several countries, including the U.K., Canada and the U.S., for the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine's SBU has said it recorded more than 4,800 occasions when Russia used chemical weapons on the battlefield since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022. In May, the U.S. State Department announced sanctions against Kirillov's unit, saying the U.S. had recorded the use of chloropicrin, a poison gas first deployed in World War I, against Ukrainian troops.",
      "Kirillov, who had been in his post since April 2017, was also accused by the U.S. government of helping to spread disinformation about biological weapons and research.",
      "In March 2023, about a year into Russia's full-scale invasion, the U.S. State Department said Kirillov had \"significantly increased his media engagement\" to issue repeated, baseless claims that the U.S. government had been involved in creating both the mpox virus and COVID-19, and that the U.S. \"is developing biological weapons able to selectively target ethnic groups.\"",
      "\"The U.S. Government is concerned that this false narrative may be a prelude for a false-flag operation, where Russia itself uses biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and then attempts to blame it on Ukraine and/or the United States,\" the State Department said at the time.",
      "Russia has denied using any chemical weapons in Ukraine and, in turn, has accused Kyiv of using toxic agents in combat.",
      "Kirillov was sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court on Dec. 16 for the use of banned chemical weapons in Ukraine during Russia's military operation in Ukraine that started in Feb. 2022.",
      "Almost three years into Russia's ongoing war, Russian troops have made small but steady advances, adding to the nearly one-fifth of Ukraine they already control.",
      "Since Russia invaded, several prominent figures have been killed in targeted attacks believed to have been carried out by Ukraine.",
      "Darya Dugina, a commentator on Russian TV channels and the daughter of Kremlin-linked nationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin, died in a 2022 car bombing that investigators suspected was aimed at her father.",
      "Vladlen Tatarsky, a popular military blogger, died in April 2023, when a statuette given to him at a party in St. Petersburg exploded. A Russian woman, who said she presented the figurine on orders of a contact in Ukraine, was convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison.",
      "In December 2023, Illia Kiva, a former pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia, was shot and killed near Moscow. The Ukrainian military intelligence lauded the killing, warning that other \"traitors of Ukraine\" would share the same fate.",
      "On Dec. 9, a bomb planted under a car in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk killed Sergei Yevsyukov, the former head of the Olenivka Prison where dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war died in a missile strike in July 2022. One other person was injured in the blast. Russian authorities said they detained a suspect in the attack.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that the Russian military unit previously headed by Kirillov does not control the country's nuclear weapons, as previously stated, but only its biological and chemical weapons.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers determined that dozens of men, women and children were violently killed and cannibalized in Bronze Age-era England.",
    "story": [
      "New research suggests that dozens of Bronze-Age era Britons were killed in an attack unlike any previous known to archaelogists studying that time period and location.",
      "The research on human remains from Charterhouse Warren in southwest England, conducted by a team of researchers from multiple institutions including Oxford University, was published in Antiquity, a journal of world archaeology. It found that at least 37 Bronze Age-era men, women and children were \"killed and butchered\" and then cannibalized, with their bodies then thrown down a nearly 50-foot deep natural shaft. While archaeologists have found the remains of Bronze Age and later Britons who died violently, those incidents were largely isolated. Mass graves from this era have also been found, but the remains were laid to rest respectfully, unlike those studied.",
      "Researchers first became aware of the shaft in the 1970s. Two excavations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. The human remains, as well as some artifacts including a flint dagger, were found at multiple spots in the shaft during these digs. More than 3,000 individual human bones and bone fragments have been recovered overall. Those bones were used to estimate that at least 37 individual sets of remains were in the shaft. Different bone lengths show that the people killed were both male and female, and ranged in age from infants to grown adults. Ongoing research is working to determine how the people were related to each other.",
      "The way the remains were disposed of made the detailed examination possible, the researchers said. The shaft helped preserve the bones and keep them grouped together.",
      "The bones \"display clear evidence of blunt force trauma,\" according to researchers, suggesting that many of the people in the shaft \"suffered a violent death.\" Other injuries, including removal of the scalp and severed muscles in the jaw suggesting removal of the tongue or lower jaw, also likely occurred, evidenced by marks on the bones, the researchers said. Some of the victims may have been beheaded or dismembered.",
      "It's possible that the victims were held captive or ambushed, because of the severity of the injuries, the researchers said. It's not clear who could have carried out the attacks.",
      "There is also evidence that the bodies were cannibalized, the researchers said, including human teethmarks on the bones and indicators that marrow, the soft tissue inside bones, was removed. The researchers said the cannibalism was likely conducted \"within a context of a violent conflict, in which individuals are dehumanized and treated as animals.\"",
      "\"Some 37 men, women and children\u2014and possibly many more\u2014were killed at close quarters with blunt instruments and then systematically dismembered and defleshed, their long bones fractured in a way that can only be described as butchery,\" the researchers said.",
      "Later in the publication, the researchers referred to the scene as a \"massacre,\" and suggested it may have even been a \"political statement\" of violence so brazen it would have \"resonated across the wider region and over time.\" However, it's not clear what could have led to the violence: \"Neither climate change, ethnic conflict nor competition over material resources seem to offer convincing explanations,\" according to the researchers, leaving the only likely option that the violence broke out as part of a pattern of revenge or violence between communities.",
      "\"At this stage, our investigation has raised as many questions as it has answered,\" the researchers said. \"Work is ongoing to shed more light on this decidedly dark episode in British prehistory.\"",

The suspect, a man from Vancouver, British Columbia, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder after advanced DNA testing helped authorities link him to the crime.",
      "Lawrence Diehl, now 73, is accused of killing 22-year-old Christopher Smith on April 12, 1996,\u00a0according to\u00a0Ottawa Police. Smith was stabbed to death on the Portage Bridge, which connects Ottawa, the Canadian capital, to Gatineau in the neighboring province of Quebec.",

      "Multiple law enforcement agencies from across Canada worked since 2020 to solve Smith's cold case, including the national police force. Diel was identified through investigative genetic genealogy, where scientists and investigators use a combination of genetic testing and genealogy research to build a family tree for the individual whose sample is being evaluated.",
      "In Smith's case, scientists used genome sequencing to build a DNA profile for the murder suspect, according to\u00a0Othram Inc., a labratory that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy to assist law enforcement.

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the coast of Vanuatu on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction in the South Pacific island nation and reportedly killing at least six people. Casualties were arriving at hospitals and among the buildings seriously damaged in the capital of Port Vila was one that houses the U.S. embassy.",
      "A tsunami warning was called off less than two hours after the quake. With communications still down hours later and official information scarce, witness accounts of casualties began to surface on social media and through patchy phone calls.",
      "Katie Greenwood, the head of the International Federation of the Red Cross' Pacific branch, said in a social media post that at least six people had been confirmed dead and many more injured.",
      "The temblor hit just before 1 p.m. at a depth of 35 miles and was centered 18 miles west of Port Vila, the largest city in Vanuatu \u2014 a group of 80 islands that's home to about 330,000 people. It was followed by a magnitude 5.5 aftershock near the same location, with tremors continuing throughout the afternoon and evening.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear how much damage was caused as phone lines and government websites remained down, but Greenwood of the IFRC said multiple buildings had collapsed and the hospital in the capital was damaged.",
      "Doctors were working \"as fast as they could\" at a triage center outside the emergency ward, journalist Dan McGarry told The Associated Press, adding that the nation wasn't well equipped to deal with a mass casualty event. Video shared by the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation showed crowds outside the hospital.",
      "In the first official information published by Vanuatu's government, the Geohazards Department said on social media that its monitoring systems remained offline due to power outages. Residents were urged to stay away from coastlines for at least 24 hours, and until tsunami and earthquake monitoring systems were operational once again.",
      "A video posted on social media appeared to show crumpled buildings in Port Vila, including one that had collapsed onto its lower floors and cars parked on the street below. Amanda Laithwaite said her husband was among a group of rescuers attempting to shift the roof of the three-story building because they believed people were trapped inside, but their progress was slow without specialist machinery.",
      "A building housing a number of diplomatic missions in Port Vila, including those of the U.S., Britain, France and New Zealand, was significantly damaged, several of its tenants said, but the U.S. Embassy said in a message posted on its Facebook page that all staff were safe, though the building was closed until further notice.",
      "The U.S. mission only opened in July, as part of a wider push by the U.S. to expand its Pacific presence to counter China's burgeoning influence on governments in the region.",
      "A video posted on social media showed the building with some damage, including buckled windows and debris that had crumbled from walls to the ground.",
      "The French news agency AFP said its photos showed the ground floor of the diplomatic building completely flattened. The bottom floor \"no longer exists,\" Vanuatu resident Michael Thompson told AFP by satellite phone after posting images of the destruction on social media. \"It is just completely flat. The top three floors are still holding but they have dropped.\"",
      "\"There's people in the buildings in town. There were bodies there when we walked past,\" Thompson said. The quake also knocked down at least two bridges and toppled other buildings, he said.",
      "McGarry, the journalist, said a \"massive landslide\" at the international shipping terminal was likely to impede the country's recovery. The airport's runway was also damaged, he said.",
      "Vanuatu's position on a subduction zone \u2014 where the Indo-Australia tectonic plate moves beneath the Pacific Plate \u2014 means earthquakes of magnitudes greater than 6 aren't uncommon, and the country's buildings are intended to withstand quake damage.",
      "\"I think it could have been worse,\" McGarry said. But this was the most serious he had experienced during 21 years in Vanuatu, \"by a long shot,\" he said.",
      "Port Vila's airport couldn't be contacted Tuesday, but flight tracking sites suggested all flights were grounded. Some airlines in Australia and the Pacific said they had cancelled or paused flights scheduled for Wednesday and were awaiting news of the airport's status.",

    "summary": "The USS Savannah docked just miles away from a Chinese-renovated naval base.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Navy warship arrived Monday in Cambodia, the first such visit in eight years to a nation that is a close ally of China in Southeast Asia. Cambodia's government has suggested the port call reflects an upgrade in often-strained relations.",
      "The USS Savannah docked at the port of Sihanoukville on the Gulf of Thailand for a five-day visit. The Savannah, classed as a Littoral Combat Ship, carries a crew of 103.",
      "\"It's great to be back, returning U.S. presence to here after eight years,\" the ship's commanding officer, Daniel A. Sledz, said in brief remarks to reporters. He was given a bouquet of flowers by a Cambodian officer and shook hands with a line of her colleagues.",
      "The United States for many years has had rocky relations with Cambodia, criticizing its government for political repression and human rights violations. There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked.",
      "Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations.",
      "Cambodia's Ministry of National Defense said last week that the visit was scheduled after a U.S. request for a port call, and would \"strengthen and expand the bonds of friendship as well as promote bilateral cooperation\" between the two nations.",
      "Two days before that, Cambodia's foreign ministry noted \"positive momentum of bilateral ties and cooperation\" and \"the reinvigoration of military-to-military cooperation\" between Cambodia and the U.S.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visited Cambodia in early June, where he held talks with Prime Minister Hun Manet and other senior officials. He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department said at the time that Austin's discussions concerned \"opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security,\" and other matters.",
      "But Washington remains concerned that the upgrading of Cambodia's Ream Naval Base near Sihanoukville will serve Beijing's strategic interests in the region.",
      "The U.S. and others suggest China's navy is establishing a permanent base at Ream, which would give it easier access to the Malacca Strait, a critical shipping route between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.",
      "Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.",
      "Cambodia's government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion.",
      "Washington has said the Ream base could give Beijing a key strategic position in the Gulf of Thailand near the disputed South China Sea, which China claims almost in its entirety.",
      "Chinese warships first docked at the 1,190-foot pier in December last year. Two berthed at Sihanoukville port in May as part of Beijing's biggest joint military drills with Cambodia.",
      "The Chinese military unveiled machine gun-equipped \"robodogs\" this year at the annual joint exercises, known as the \"Golden Dragon\" drills.",
      "Cambodia's defense ministry said 27 U.S. navy vessels have visited the nation since 2007, although the USS Savannah's visit was the first docking in eight years.",
      "On Monday, Beijing responded to the U.S. warship's visit to Sihanoukville saying \"such exchanges and collaborations in security and defense should contribute to promoting regional peace and stability, rather than the opposite.\"",
      "In September, Cambodia's Defense Ministry said that China is giving its navy two warships of the type it has had docked there for months. China is set to hand over two newly built Type 56 corvettes - smaller vessels typically used for coastal patrols - next year at the earliest, after Cambodia requested China's support.",
      "Cambodia's defense ministry said the Savannah's port call will include \"a working meeting with the commander of the Ream Naval Base,\" as well as meetings with provincial officials and \"a friendship sports competition between the crews of the U.S. Navy and the Cambodian Navy.\"",
      "Cambodian Navy Capt. Mean Savoeun, deputy commander of the Ream Naval Base, was among those dockside welcoming the Savannah to Sihanoukville. He said he was happy to see the good relationship between Cambodia and the U.S., especially their navies, and believed the visit will bring closer diplomatic cooperation.",
      "The Littoral Combat Ship USS Savannah (LCS 28) was commissioned in 2022 and is the sixth ship named in honor of the city of Savannah, according to the U.S. Navy.",
      "\"The LCS is a fast, agile, mission-focused platform designed to operate in near-shore environments while capable of open-ocean tasking,\" the Navy says. \"The LCS can support forward presence, maritime security, sea control, and deterrence.",

    "summary": "Weapons of war accumulated by the toppled Assad regime over half of a century are being systemically obliterated by massive Israeli airstrikes.",
    "story": [
      "Damascus\u00a0\u2014 A CBS News team drove through a Syrian military airbase on the outskirts of capital city Damascus Monday, and the devastation caused by Israeli air strikes was abundantly clear. Israel has said it's determined to destroy weapons and other military hardware that ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his father spent half of a century accumulating, before it can fall into the hands of extremists.",
      "The Israeli military has pounded Syrian military infrastructure relentlessly since Assad fled to Russia earlier this month \u2014 forced out by a shock rebel offensive after a decade of civil war that had, until about two weeks ago, largely ground to an apparent stalemate.",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "The damage inflicted on Assad's old war machine has been staggering. One strike overnight in the coastal city of Tartus, for instance, was so massive that the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group quoted a scientist in Turkey as saying it had registered on the Richter scale as the equivalent of a category-3 earthquake.",
      "Until Moscow's ally Assad fled from Syria, Russia maintained its only major naval base outside of Russian territory in Tartus. Satellite imagery (below) showed most of the Russian ships disappearing from the Tartus port quickly after Assad fell, but the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that it was still figuring out what to do about its military hardware and personnel in the country, in talks with the country's new de-facto rebel rulers.",
      "Israel's military, meanwhile, says it has laid waste to most of Assad's heavy weapons and air defenses. In a statement on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that in recent days its fighter jets had \"inflicted severe damage on Syria's most strategic weapons: fighter jets and helicopters, Scud missiles, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea precision-guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, radars, rockets, and more.\"",
      "The IDF said its strikes had destroyed \"over 90% of the identified strategic surface-to-air missiles\" of the ousted regime.",
      "The lightning takeover of Syria one week ago by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or HTS, has also seen Israeli forces carry out a land incursion that stretches past the occupied Golan Heights region into a previously demilitarized buffer zone inside Syria.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's new de-facto leader, has criticized what he described as Israel's \"uncalculated military adventures,\" and said he and his group \u2014 which, before publicly distancing itself from extremist ideology was an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 was more interested in state-building than opening another conflict with Israel.",
      "The targeting of Syria's military sites has also revealed deep neglect by Assad. Years of corruption and a decade of civil war had hollowed out the nation's armed forces, contributing to his regime's collapse. Much of the hardware left behind by his forces when they surrendered to the rebels or simply shed their uniforms and ran away is old and clearly lacking maintenance.",
      "Assad's office issued the first statement attributed to the deposed leader since he was forced to flee from his country, meanwhile. In it, he claims he never considered resigning nor fleeing, but that he took shelter in the Russian-run air base at Hmeimim as the rebels closed in, and when that facility came under a sustained drone attack, he says an evacuation was ordered on Dec. 8, the day after the HTS rebels took the capital Damascus.",
      "He said he eventually left for Russia as there was nothing else he could do in Syria, lamenting the country's fall \"into the hands of terrorism.\"",
      "The statement was posted to the Syrian Presidency's official channel on the Telegram messaging app, with a note saying it had been posted after several unsuccessful attempts to release it through Arabic and international media outlets. The statement was deleted relatively quickly from the Telegram channel, however, without any explanation, before reappearing there and on the presidency's Facebook page.",
      "While the wider international community is still trying to figure out how to deal with HTS, which has said it will respect Syrians all of religions and appears determined to be viewed as a secular interim administration \u2014 though it has not said what will come next for the country after a three-month transitional period \u2014 Israel and the U.S. have remained focused largely on securing Assad's stockpiled weapons.",
      "For Israel, that has meant the most ferocious airstrikes carried out in Syria in years, and they continued on Monday, just over a week after Assad's sudden departure.",
      "Whoever does end up in control of Syria will inherit a military infrastructure largely in tatters. Judging by the IDF's statement on Monday, claiming its strikes amounted to \"a significant achievement for the Israeli Air Force's superiority in the region,\" that could be exactly as intended.",

      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Sudan's Rapid Support Forces, one side in a civil war that's torn the African nation apart for more than a year and created one of the worst humanitarian crises on the planet, are accused of raping scores of women and girls and using some as sex slaves in a new report by Human Rights Watch. The New York-based rights group says the paramilitary forces' use of sexual violence in the country's South Kordofan state since September 2023 constitutes war crimes and possible crimes against humanity.",
      "HRW lays out the findings of an investigation based on the cases of almost 80 women and girls in a report published Monday, detailing horrific new allegations of abuse in Sudan, where both sides in the civil war had already been accused of war crimes.",
      "Researchers gathered evidence on 79 women and girls between the ages of 7 and 50 whom HRW says were raped, with most incidents occurring at an RSF military base in Dibeibat, near the town of Habila in South Kordofan.",
      "Survivors and witnesses told the group that the men who carried out the attacks were all uniformed RSF forces or members of allied militias.",
      "\"Survivors described being gang raped in front of their families and over prolonged periods of time, including while being held as sex slaves,\" said HRW Associate Crisis and Conflict Director Belkis Wille, who conducted many of the interviews with the survivors.",
      "Ezzaddean Elsafi, a senior RSF adviser, denied the accusations in the HRW report to CBS News, claiming \"people wearing RSF uniforms\" behind the alleged attacks were impersonators, not actual RSF forces.",
      "\"RSF takes this very seriously and will investigate.  We are highly sensitive to sexual violence against women and the perpetrators will be held accountable,\" said Elsafi, denying that the group even has a significant presence in South Kordofan, though acknowledging it has forces \"in the Debibat area,\" near the boarder with North Kordofan state.",
      "\"This is absolutely disinformation,\" he said of the HRW report.",
      "HRW said it had shared a summary of its investigation's findings with the RSF's overall commander, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, but had not received a response.",
      "Wille has spent years documenting sexual violence in conflicts around the world, including by ISIS militants against Yazidi women in Iraq, but she told CBS News, \"What is really astonishing to me after meeting these women and girls is the scope and scale\" of the crimes in Sudan.",
      "CBS News has seen video of the full interview HRW conducted with an 18-year-old woman whom the group identified as Hania. She said she was pregnant in February when RSF fighters burst into her home in Habila and grabbed her, her 17-year-old neighbor and 16 other girls she knew from her neighborhood. She said they were taken in 10 vehicles to the military base in Dibeibat.",
      "When they arrived, Hania said she recognized more than 30 other girls from her town already there, with about 100 fighters holding them captive.",
      "She said when she tried to resist being raped, one of the militants \"started beating me with a metal whip.\" Over the next three months, she said \"the fighters came in groups of three every morning to take some girls to rape them, and then in the evening another group of three would come and take another set of girls to rape them.\"",
      "Hania said the RSF men held her and the other women and girls in a type of animal pen constructed with wire and tree branches, where they were chained up in groups of ten.",
      "\"What was clear from these cases is that in areas with RSF with control, absolutely nowhere is safe \u2013 not if you flee, or even in your home. Woman and girls are at risk of being raped no matter where,\" Wille told CBS News.",
      "Another woman, Hasina, 35, told HRW that six uniformed RSF men shot and killed her husband and stole all their cattle and money. She said the cows were her family's investment so, with them and her money stolen, she felt she had no means to flee like many of her neighbors had done, and she and her six young children, some just babies, had no choice but to stay in their home.",
      "The RSF fighters returned three days later, she said, and \"all three men raped me, and left.\"",
      "Later that evening, \"three more came back and raped me again and told me to stay in my house.\"",
      "She said she was gang-raped almost every day for the next month before she fled.",
      "HRW met Hasina at Camp Al-Hailu, a makeshift facility with little to no resources for internally displaced civilians in South Kordofan.",
      "\"She really is barely able to wake up and keep going because of what she lived through. Her kids are now in a camp with little food and looked very malnourished when I saw them. \u2026 She is struggling to function as a mother,\" said Wille, adding that women living in tents next to Hasina were helping to care for her kids.",
      "Wille said there was no psychological support for traumatized women in the camp or across much of the country.",
      "\"When I brought up the question of justice and accountability to these women, all of them looked blankly at me, as justice is a meaningless concept to them,\" she said. \"The scale with which it happens here means it's become normalized behavior by the RSF. None of these women have ever heard of a soldier or fighter ever being held accountable.\"",
      "Hania and a friend who was also pregnant managed to escape from their captors. They were interviewed by HRW in the Nuba mountains. They said 49 girls were still being held at the base and she'd heard of girls being held at two other RSF bases, as well.",
      "\"We have no way of finding out more about these women, as access is very difficult and dangerous, and in these areas there is no electricity, no cellphone networks, so no information comes out. There is an absolute silence on these abuses,\" said Wille. \"We will likely never know what happened to these women and girls.\"",
      "The International Rescue Committee charity says the humanitarian crisis driven by Sudan's civil war has been the biggest ever recorded for the second year in a row in 2024, with more than 30 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It's estimated that roughly half of Sudan's 50 million people are suffering from severe hunger.",

      "French authorities said entire neighborhoods \u2014 many of which consisted of poorly constructed slum-settlements \u2014 had been flattened, and public infrastructure including airports and hospitals was badly damaged, the AP reported. Damage to the airport control tower meant only military aircraft could land in Mayotte, complicating the rescue response. Electricity has also reportedly been knocked out across the archipelago.",

Mayotte is regarded as the poorest territory that falls under the sovereignty of any European Union nation, however it still draws a significant number of economic migrants from nearby nations that are even poorer, due largely to the French state welfare system being implemented there.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office said Monday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and didn't appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had denied the charge.",
      "The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.",
      "The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.",
      "An attorney for Dawson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.",
      "The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon \u2014 who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday \u2014 said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis, the organization confirmed when he was arrested. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, an idyllic South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people."

    "summary": "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands.",
    "story": [
      "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte from Cyclone Chido is \"several hundred\" and may run into the thousands, the island's top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday.",
      "France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction.",
      "\"I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we'll get close to a thousand. Even thousands ... given the violence of this event,\" Mayotte Prefect Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere.",
      "He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years.",
      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte, in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, is France's poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \"this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\" he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone's path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \"thoughts\" were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \"will be high,\" while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \"help the population and prevent potential looting.\"",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\"Mayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\" he said.",
      "Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding.",
      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

Walter Braga Netto, a former member of President Jair Bolsonaro's government and his 2022 running mate, in connection with investigations into an alleged coup plot. Lula has largely avoided commenting on the case because of ongoing investigations.",

      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",

      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",

For many, it\u2019s also a time to indulge in shopping. And why not? This is when you find the best deals on your favorite products, whether it\u2019s a new electronic gadget or a household essential.",
      "However, the holiday season also comes with an increased risk of mobile fraud while shopping online. Scammers often target online shoppers in more ways than you might imagine. Fortunately, with some awareness and precautions, you can protect yourself. Below, I\u2019ll discuss the rise in mobile shopping scams and how you can stay safe.",

      "The rise in mobile fraud",
      "According to\u00a0Appdome's latest U.S. Consumer Survey, 60.6% of Americans say fraud is their biggest concern. More than 40% of global consumers reported that they or someone close to them had been directly affected by mobile fraud, malware or a cyberattack. With mobile apps now being the main way people interact with brands, skepticism among users is growing. In fact, 24% of consumers believe developers don\u2019t care about app security, a massive jump of 258% since 2021.",
      "Social engineering has become a major worry, as people are becoming more aware of the many ways mobile fraud can happen. This includes things like location spoofing, scams that manipulate users and account takeovers. Almost half of the survey respondents this year said they or someone they know personally had dealt with fraud, scams or similar issues.",
      "Such scams also affect your online shopping experience. I spoke with Tom Tovar, CEO of Appdome, regarding what consumers need to know when they are shopping on their mobile devices this holiday season.",
      "\"Consumers should be aware of phishing, smishing and vishing scams, which exploit fake emails, deceptive SMS messages and fraudulent phone calls to steal sensitive information. More sophisticated threats include FaceID bypass attacks, such as those carried out by the GoldPickaxe malware, which uses AI-enhanced techniques to bypass biometric authentication,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "\"Other significant risks include banking trojans, which infiltrate apps to steal login credentials or financial data, and accessibility malware, which exploits device accessibility features to take control of mobile interactions. The rise of these sophisticated threats highlights the need for robust in-app security.\"",

      "This might seem obvious, but sticking to trusted apps can help keep you safe while shopping. By trusted apps, I mean platforms like Amazon, eBay and Walmart.",
      "\"With the growing sophistication of mobile threats, it\u2019s becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to identify risks independently. Threats like phishing, accessibility malware and banking trojans are designed to mimic legitimate functions, making them nearly impossible to detect at a glance. Instead of relying solely on spotting issues, consumers should look for apps that clearly communicate their commitment to security through visible privacy policies, transparent security practices and updates addressing new threats. Choosing apps from trusted sources and reading user reviews can also provide reassurance,\"\u00a0Tovar said.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "When shopping on your phone, be cautious of\u00a0phishing, smishing and\u00a0vishing scams, as they are common tactics used to steal your personal and financial information. Phishing involves fake emails that look like they are from trusted retailers, tricking you into sharing sensitive details like passwords or payment information. Smishing is a similar tactic but delivered through text messages, often containing links to fake websites or malicious downloads.",
      "Vishing, on the other hand, involves scammers making phone calls pretending to be customer service representatives from well-known brands, attempting to gain access to your private information. Always verify the authenticity of emails, texts or calls before clicking links or sharing details to ensure a safe shopping experience.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "When shopping online on your phone, it's important to be careful about the permissions you give to apps. A lot of apps may ask for access to things like your camera, contacts or location, even if it's not necessary for the shopping experience. Always think twice before granting these permissions.",
      "\"These permissions are often abused by malware to collect sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. Before granting permissions, consider whether they align with the app\u2019s purpose. Developers can mitigate these risks by incorporating protections from Appdome\u2019s anti-fraud offering, which protects against the many abuse methods used by malicious actors to abuse mobile app permissions,\" Tovar said.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Protecting financial information is crucial, especially when shopping online. It's important to use secure websites, indicated by \"https\" in the URL, and avoid saving payment details in apps or on websites unless they are trustworthy.",
      "While consumers should stay vigilant \u2013 by using trusted apps, downloading only from official app stores and monitoring for suspicious activity \u2013 there\u2019s only so much they can do, Tovar said.",
      "\"The sophistication of modern threats often makes it impossible for users to identify or prevent all risks on their own,\" he said. \"Consumers have a better chance of keeping their personal information secure by choosing brands that prioritize security and back it up with tangible actions, such as automating robust protections and delivering proactive, built-in security measures.\"",

      "The holiday season is a prime time for shopping and, unfortunately, for scams. As mobile shopping continues to grow, threats like AI-driven scams and advanced malware are expected to increase.

      "The holiday season is a time filled with joy, festivities and cherished moments with family and friends. However, amidst the hustle and bustle of shopping, cooking and celebrating, it's easy to overlook a lurking danger: scams. Scammers thrive during this busy time, preying on our excitement and stress to trick us into revealing personal information or losing money.

      "1) Package delivery scam",
      "With the holiday season in full swing, the end-of-year sales have begun, and you probably have already started your holiday shopping and are expecting packages coming via different types of delivery services like FedEx, UPS or USPS. So, if you receive a text that mentions a package delivery, you may be likely to easily fall for a scam. I was expecting a package recently and received this text out of the blue (see image).",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Even though the text says the sender is not in my contact list and that it may be junk, I almost clicked the link because I was so focused on the fact that there may have been a typo in my delivery address. But once I looked a little closer, there were a few red flags in this text message that tipped me off to it being a scam.",
      "First, the link does not lead you to usps.com. It's a fake link that scammers hope you won't notice.\u00a0Notice it is uspsts.top and not\u00a0usps.com. This is a common scam going around called typosquatting wherein a scammer uses a domain that looks close to a real website. Next, the text says \"pls,\" which is lingo for \"please\" that you likely wouldn't see in correspondence from the USPS. Scammers often make typos or use poor grammar when communicating, so always double-check.Scammers are sending emails, texts and even occasionally there could be a phone call that is regarding an issue with package delivery. It may be something like this text I received that has a link where they'll end up asking for information, or you may be asked to pay a \"shipping fee\" to get your package.Be sure to always have strong\u00a0antivirus software running on your devices to prevent any disasters from happening if you were to click on a malicious link.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

You most likely received an email regarding your package, and if you go to that email to get your order number, you should be able to look up the status of your order directly on any website.",

      "8 PHISHING EMAIL SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS HOLIDAY SEASON",
      "2) Charity scams",
      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "3)\u00a0Social media gift exchange scam",
      "The\u00a0Better Business Bureau is warning about a gift exchange scam with a new twist, which has been occurring during recent holiday seasons. It's an online version of the popular \"Secret Santa\" gift exchange. However, the BBB says these social media-driven gift exchanges are actually pyramid schemes, and you will most likely be disappointed if you participate.",
      "In the past few years, variations of the gift exchange have popped up, with someone asking you to select a random person and send them a gift to pay it forward. Another asks you to exchange bottles of wine with someone else, and while it seems fun and light-hearted, you don't know who is on the receiving end.",
      "It may sound nice to send a holiday gift to a stranger in turn for receiving multiple gifts yourself, but you're never going to receive many (if any) gifts at all.\u00a0Don't participate in gift exchanges with anyone you don't know, or you won't be able to guarantee you'll actually be gifting someone who isn't a scammer.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",
      "Illustration of a gift card (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE BEST WAY TO BUY GIFT CARDS EVER",
      "5) Home Depot email confirmation scam",
      "Scammers are capitalizing on the festive spirit with a deceptive email campaign targeting people at this time of year.\u00a0This scam involves a deceptive email that appears to be from Home Depot with such wording as \"Confirmation needed: please confirm receipt.\" The email body typically contains enticing text like \"Congratulations! The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",
      "Fake Home Depot winning email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6) Fake online shopping sites scam",
      "One of the most common scams during the holiday season is the fake online shopping site scam. Scammers create websites that look like legitimate online stores but are actually designed to steal your personal and financial information. They may offer products at very low prices or claim to have limited-time deals or exclusive items. They may also send you\u00a0phishing emails or text messages with links to these fake sites.",
      "A woman shopping on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The website address does not match the name of the store or brand.The website has poor design and/or spelling and grammar errors.The website does not have a secure connection\u00a0(https) or a padlock icon in the address bar.The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",

      "The website asks for too much personal information, such as your Social Security number or bank account details.",
      "The website does not have a clear return policy, contact information or customer reviews.",
      "How to avoid falling victim to this scam",
      "By following a few simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling prey to online scams and ensure a safer shopping experience.",
      "1) Shop only from trusted and reputable online stores that you know and have used before.",
      "2) Check the website address carefully and look for any red flags.",
      "3) Do some research on the online store before making a purchase. Read customer reviews, look for ratings or search for complaints online.",
      "4) Use a credit card or a secure payment service like PayPal when shopping online. Do not use debit cards, wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "5) Keep track of your online purchases and monitor your bank statements for any unauthorized charges.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus protection software. An effective antivirus software is a must-have. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links on fake websites or in phishing emails and text messages is to have\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices.\u00a0It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0See my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service. Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "I've been scammed! What to do next?",
      "Below are some next steps if you find you or your loved one is a victim of identity theft.",
      "1) If you can regain control of your accounts, change your passwords and inform the account provider",
      "2) Look through bank statements and checking account transactions to see where outlier activity started",
      "3)\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4)\u00a0Report any breaches to official government agencies like the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "5) Get the professional advice of a lawyer",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theftIf being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "Before speaking to law enforcement, especially when you are dealing with criminal identity theft",
      "If being a victim of criminal identity theft leaves you unable to secure employment or housing",
      "6)\u00a0Alert all three major credit bureaus and possibly place a fraud alert on your credit report.",
      "7) Run your own background check or request a copy of one if that is how you discovered your information has been used by a criminal.",
      "If you are a victim of identity theft, the most important thing to do is to take immediate action to mitigate the damage and prevent further harm.",

      "Holiday decoration theft has become an increasingly frustrating issue for many homeowners. Karen from Los Angeles shared her experience with us in an email, stating,",
      "\"We have criminals who visit our neighborhood to not only steal mail and packages but also holiday decorations. I made a Christmas decoration for our mailbox, which was promptly stolen.\"",
      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Smart solutions for festive security",
      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

      "Apple AirTags: An alternative approach",
      "For those considering a switch to\u00a0Apple, AirTags present another viable option. Karen asked if she would have problems tracking her decorations with an Apple AirTag. While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",

      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

      "Battery performance in winter conditions",
      "According to Harbinger, all battery-powered vehicles face challenges in cold weather due to two main factors: reduced battery performance and increased energy consumption for cabin heating. At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

    "story": [
      "The \"CyberGuy\" addresses potential blockchain scams.",
      "Blockchain scams are increasingly prevalent, and it\u2019s essential to understand what they are and how to recognize them before they take a toll on your finances.",
      "For instance, John from Sunset Beach, North Carolina, recently reached out with a pressing question about some suspicious messages he\u2019s been receiving in his inbox.",

These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",
      "A man holding cryptocurrency coins (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",

    "story": [
      "Retired FBI profiler Candice Delong joins \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom\u2019 to explain possible motives for alleged CEO killer Luigi Mangione.",
      "The former Ivy League computer scientist-turned-suspected corporate assassin likely won't face federal charges, preventing any risk of the death penalty since New York doesn't have one, experts say.",
      "Murder is typically not a crime that falls under federal jurisdiction, except under specific circumstances. Hiring a hitman who crosses state lines to commit a murder-for-hire is a federal crime, but crossing state lines yourself to commit one is not.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, faces a second-degree murder charge in New York state in connection with the ambush shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was gunned down by a masked assassin outside a Manhattan Hilton hotel on Dec. 4. New York's murder laws are broken down differently than most other states, and first-degree charges in the Empire State are typically reserved for special cases, including against the slaying of a member of law enforcement or mass murders.",
      "\"It's possible, but not likely, that Mangione is charged federally,\" said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who now runs a private practice in Los Angeles. \"The case has gotten a lot of attention, and there is no knowing what Trump's Department of Justice will do, but a federal prosecution requires a federal jurisdictional hook, like the commission of another federal crime or a substantial nexus to interstate commerce.\"",

      "The feds usually step in because they see a need to secure a stricter punishment or because they can bring more resources to the job than a local department, according to Nicole Parker, a former FBI agent. But the NYPD is well-equipped and has already built a strong case, she said.",

      "\"New York outlawed the death penalty 20 years ago, so capital punishment is not an option there,\" Rahmani said. \"But even if Mangione is charged federally, the only aggravating factor to support the death penalty is that the murder involved substantial planning and premeditation.\"",
      "Capital punishment is typically reserved for the worst of the worst criminal cases. Even if New York had a death penalty, other aggravators such as additional victims, the defendant's criminal history or that the murder took place during the commission of another felony don't exist in this case, he said.",

      "On top of that, it's rare for the federal government to seek the death penalty, but it does happen in cases of extreme violence, such as in the Boston Marathon bombing, which killed three and wounded hundreds. Prosecutors can use it as leverage to get a confession.",
      "Sending bombs through the mail, like the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, is also a federal crime. He killed himself in prison last year while serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.",
      "Justice Department records show the federal government has executed 16 people since 2001, beginning with the deaths of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and, eight days later, American drug trafficker Juan Raul Garza, who had two men killed and executed a third himself.",

      "Following Bashar al-Assad's fall from power, a new government is taking shape in Syria that has many wondering if it will moderate its Islamist stance or, as some have predicted, function like the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
      "The\u00a0U.S.-designated terrorist group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) had been ruling the Idlib Governate in northwest Syria and set up its own regime known as the Syrian Salvation Government and said it had shed its global Jihadist aims for a focus on local governance. In Idlib, HTS created a bureaucratic system and various ministries to administer some public services, including public safety.",
      "\"By all accounts, it has ruled with an iron fist there,\" Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Fox News Digital.",
      "At its height, HTS ruled over approximately 2 million people in Idlib Province. Its leader, Mohammed al-Golani attempted to rebrand HTS and distance the group from the global jihadist elements of al Qaeda and instead focused on local issues in Idlib.",

      "Questions still remain about how al-Golani would rule all of Syria. Some Syria watchers who monitored the groups record in Idlib caution that HTS was no democratic regime.",
      "Hall, an expert on Syria, said that HTS exhibited mixed behavior in Idlib, including kicking out Christians, although Hall noted that she knows personally of religious minorities, including Alawites, who did live peacefully in Idlib.",
      "Other aspects of their rule in Idlib are more troubling.",

      "\"In terms of their iron fist, HTS tried to do away with dissent when there were protests against them. It was reported that they had killed a famous political activist, Raed Fares. There were also recent protests in Idlib over people who have died in detention under HTS custody,\" Hall said.",
      "HTS was less than tolerant and known for suppressing political dissent. Hall also noted she personally knows of people who were \"beat up\" by HTS fighters.",
      "Golani did oversee a de-emphasis on strict interpretations of Islam and limited the power of the feared morality police that monitored women\u2019s public wardrobe. The problem now, according to Hall, is not necessarily HTS\u2019 previous record of governance in Idlib, but the power vacuum that is left with Assad ousted.",

      "\"Everyone is going to be grabbing for power and influence,\" Hall said, adding that the U.S. and the West need to mitigate risk and insure a more stable and peaceful future for Syria and deal with the vulnerabilities of each potential governing group.",
      "Tammy Palacios, program manager of the Priority Sustainable Counterterrorism program at the New Lines Institute and who closely monitors Syria, noted that although al-Golani made significant efforts to disconnect from his Jihadist past, moderation at other levels of HTS remains less clear.",
      "HTS security forces were known to \"arrest, judge, torture, detain, and kill individuals as a form of sharia law enforcement\" exercising control in Idlib. Elements of the HTS administration in Idlib also educated and influenced the population in accordance with a hardline interpretation of Sharia law.",

      "Since toppling the Assad dynasty, HTS set up a transitional government, called the Syrian Salvation Government, and named an interim prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir. HTS leader al-Golani and the interim prime minister met with the former prime minister of Syria during the final months of the Assad regime, Muhammad Ghazi Al-Jalali, who decided to remain in his home in Damascus when the government fell.",
      "During their lightning two-week advance to conquer Syria, HTS promised to protect the rights of all Syrians, regardless of faith or ethnicity, and also promised to protect Shia religious sites. When the rebels finally entered Damascus and Assad fled, al-Golani ordered his fighters not to attack government ministries and, along with Jalali, ensured that the day-to-day work of the government would continue.",

      "Al-Golani, who has a $10 million bounty on his head from the U.S., seeks to present a toned-down version of the radical Islamism that has defined his years of fighting in Syria and in Iraq against American troops. Al-Golani was detained by the U.S. military in the first decade of this century. When the Syrian uprising against Assad broke out, al-Golani built a new organization called Jabhat al-Nusra.",
      "He also had once pledged allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, but he officially broke ties with the group in 2016, and Nusra became HTS in 2017. Many observers of HTS at the time critiqued the break as cosmetic, but al-Qaeda actually condemned the creation of HTS, creating further divides between the groups.",

      "While HTS governed Idlib in northeast Syria, the group targeted rival Islamist groups, including Ahrar Al-Sham, Hurras Al-Din and other Jihadist groups tied to al Qaeda and ISIS. Much like U.S. negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan, combating terrorism and ensuring that Syria does not become a safe haven for terrorists will be a prerequisite for any recognition by the U.S. and other allies.",
      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Saturday that the U.S. has had direct contact with HTS since it overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad. HTS has already said it would cooperate with the U.S. in the search for Austin Tice, the American journalist missing in Syria since 2012 and who was believed to be held captive by the Assad regime. The initial contact with the rebel group and their promise to work with the U.S. to bring Tice home could further legitimize the group as it looks to consolidate its control over post-Assad Syria.",

      "The U.S. and U.K. are considering whether to remove HTS off its foreign terrorist list, which will be important if HTS consolidates its rule over Syria. Hall says that HTS must establish a checklist to implement in order to get itself removed from the terrorist designation list.",

      "Previous international agreements under U.N. Resolution 1559, signed in 2004, and Resolution 1701, signed in 2006, called for the disarmament and dissolution of all militia groups and for the deployment of U.N. and Lebanese forces to the south of the country to stop Hezbollah from gaining a hold in the areas bordering Israel. Both resolutions failed to be realized.",

      "NBC News spent months documenting the use of unclaimed bodies in medical research, submitting public records requests to dozens of state agencies, county coroners and medical schools. The records offer glimpses of where and how this is occurring.",
      "Since 2020, a community college in North Carolina has received 43 unclaimed bodies from local welfare agencies and medical examiners to teach embalming to funeral services students. In Pennsylvania, a state body-donation program that distributes human remains to medical schools said that it had received 58 unclaimed bodies from county coroners, medical examiners, hospitals and other facilities since 2019. Louisiana State University provided records on a single 2023 case in which an unclaimed car wreck victim was sent to the school\u2019s forensic department for study; a university spokesperson said the lab prioritizes \u201cethical practices and respect for the dignity of individuals.\u201d",
      "But in many states where it is legal to use unclaimed bodies for medical research, officials told NBC News that they did not have records of any such cases or denied requests for detailed information. That included Pennsylvania, where an official said the body-donation program could not share how the 58 unclaimed bodies were used. In Illinois, a 2018 law requires record-keeping of the unclaimed bodies provided to medical institutions, but a spokesperson for the state agency responsible for the task said it is not doing it because no one allocated any money for the effort.",
      "\u201cThere could be a lot more happening that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Joy Balta, an anatomy professor at Point Loma Nazarene University in California. He wants to see more regulation of the body donation industry and has written guidelines that call for donation programs to stop using unclaimed bodies. Otherwise, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to know about it.\u201d",
      "The most extensive use of the unclaimed dead that reporters found was at a Fort Worth-based medical school, the University of North Texas Health Science Center. NBC News reported this year that the center collected thousands of unclaimed bodies from county medical examiners and leased some out to private companies and the Army, often without consent from any next of kin. The center halted the use of unclaimed bodies in response to NBC News\u2019 reporting, citing failures of \u201crespect, care and professionalism.\u201d",
      "In the absence of regulations, many coroners, hospitals or nursing homes are left to decide for themselves what to do when people die without a relative available to arrange a funeral. For some, the easiest \u2014 and cheapest \u2014 solution is to donate the body to a medical school or a body dealer, even if there is no indication that is what the person or their next of kin wanted.Marinelli\u2019s journey from a public hospital to a for-profit body broker demonstrates the peril of this choice: Health care workers and local authorities often lack the time and expertise to find people\u2019s relatives, NBC News has found, and when they fail to do so, families are denied the chance to decide what happens to their loved one\u2019s remains.",
      "Once she learned of her father\u2019s death, Wandel began to seek answers, growing angrier at each step.",
      "\u201cIf they could do this to a veteran Army officer, a guy with a house, a guy with a dog, a guy with family,\u201d she said, \u201cimagine what could happen to really vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "Wandel acknowledges that her father was a difficult man.",
      "Marinelli grew up in New Jersey, joined the Army, attended law school and served several years as a military lawyer during the Vietnam War. He told his daughter that an assignment representing a soldier who had fired on his own unit nearly broke him, and sparked a drinking habit that developed into alcoholism. He went on to work at the Justice Department\u2019s tax division, but lost his job and went into private practice, Wandel said.",
      "Marinelli\u2019s wife, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, also suffered from addiction, and from mental illness, Wandel said. They separated but did not divorce. Neither was able to properly care for Wandel, their only child, so she spent much of her childhood in foster care but stayed in touch with her parents.",
      "For years, Marinelli tried to clean up and get his daughter back but couldn\u2019t make it stick, Wandel said. Still, he taught her to swim, ride a bike and drive. He took her to folk and bluegrass concerts. He attended her graduations from high school, college and law school, and walked her down the aisle at her wedding.",
      "In 2009, after Wandel\u2019s mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer, she returned to her and slept by her bedside until she died. She and her father later fought over his refusal to help administer her mother\u2019s affairs, Wandel said, and, in 2011, they stopped talking.",
      "Caring for her mother inspired Wandel to volunteer at a hospice. \u201cI found the idea of people dying without dignity or without somebody there to listen to them and hold their hand really offensive,\u201d she said.",
      "If she had known her father was dying, she said, \u201cI would have been there.\u201d"

      "Prosecutors filed another murder charge Tuesday against the accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, bringing the number of alleged victims to seven \u2014 all women who were slain near New York City.",
      "A hair linked to the wife or daughter of suspect Rex Heuermann was found near the left wrist of 24-year-old victim Valerie Mack, according to court documents.",
      "Heuermann's daughter would have been 4 at the time of Mack's killing and his now-estranged wife is not considered a suspect in any of these slayings.",
      "Mack worked as an escort before her skeletal remains were found in 2000 and 2011, taking years for her to be identified.",
      "Mack's killer severed her right leg, which had a tattoo of her son's name on it, prosecutors said.",
      "Notes found on the suspect's computer, which prosecutors have called his \"planning document,\"  called \"for the removal of identifying marks on the victim's body,\" such as tattoos, \"prior to packaging the body for transportation.\"",
      "Investigators believe the killer cut off \"Mack's lower right leg at mid-calf to inhibit and/or delay the identification of Ms. Mack's tattoo and therefore, Ms. Mack,\"  prosecutors said in court documents.",
      "Many of the victims were sex workers who allegedly met Heuermann after advertising their services.",
      "\"The lives of these women matter,\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters in Riverhead.",
      "\"We as investigators, we understand that. Obviously no one understands it more than the families. So again, we\u2019re just delighted and honored and privileged to be able to work with these families.\"",
      "Heuermann, 61, spoke briefly in court Tuesday and denied involvement in the women\u2019s slayings and the dumping of her  remains, which were found along the southern shore of Long Island.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I am not guilty of any of these charges,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside court, defense lawyer Michael Brown said he'll attack the company doing DNA testing for investigators.",
      "The defense is also considering whether to ask for the trial to be moved out of Suffolk County or to have the seven murder charges broken into separate cases.",
      "\"I know he\u2019s extremely frustrated, he has said from day one he is not responsible for these murders,\" Brown told reporters. \"He wants his day in court.\"",
      "Investigators are still working on other nearby, unsolved murders to see if they could be linked to Heuermann, officials said.",
      "No one has yet been arrested in the slaying of Karen Vergata, 34, who had previously been dubbed \u201cJane Doe Seven.\u201d Sets of her remains were found in 1996 and 2011.",
      "Police are still looking for the killer of a victim dubbed \"Asian Doe.\" The person, whose body was found in 2011,  has been described by authorities as a \u201cbiological male\u201d of Chinese descent who was wearing women\u2019s clothes when the remains were discovered.",
      "There\u2019s no telling how many possible victims could be out there, and an \u201carmy\u201d of investigators is pursuing numerous cold cases in the area, according to Tierney.",
      "The prosecutor spoke to reporters with loved ones of several victims standing behind him.",
      "\"Let's be clear, none of the victims deserve to die,\" said attorney Gloria Allred, representing the families of several victims. \"They were all innocent and they were just trying to earn some funds to support themselves and their families. They were and they are loved and they are missed every day.\"",
      "Mack's loved ones have been kept in the loop on the probe, officials said, leading to Heuermann being charged.",
      "\"They are very grateful,\" Tierney said. \"They are very grateful for the small bit of closure that the task force has been able to provide.\"",
      "The charge connected to Mack comes after Heuermann was accused by Suffolk County prosecutors of murdering Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, Amber Costello, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Sandra Costilla and Jessica Taylor.",
      "Costilla was killed in 1993, Taylor in 2003, Brainard-Barnes in 2007, Barthelemy in 2009 and  Costello and Waterman in 2010, officials said.",
      "Heuermann, a New York City architect, was arrested in July 2023  and initially indicted in connection with the slayings of Barthelemy, Waterman and Costello."

      "Two men have been charged in Boston federal court in connection with a fatal drone strike in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members and injured dozens earlier this year.",
      "Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, 42, a dual U.S.-Iranian national of Natick, Massachusetts, and Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, also known as\u00a0Mohammad Abedini, 38, of Iran, were charged with violating U.S. export laws by conspiring to export electronic components to Iran, prosecutors in Massachusetts announced Monday.",
      "Abedini was further charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization \u2014 the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).",
      "The men allegedly conspired to evade U.S. sanctions and supply the Iranian government with a type of drone navigation technology used in the Jan. 28 drone attack at the Tower 22 base in Jordan, a U.S. military outpost, prosecutors said.",
      "Analysis of the drone recovered from the attack site showed that the drone was an Iranian Shahed UAV, and the navigation system used in the drone was the Sepehr Navigation System, which was manufactured by Abedini\u2019s company, prosecutors said in a news release.",
      "The drone, launched by IRGC-backed militants, made impact near a shelter where some troops were sleeping and killed three U.S. service members. More than 40 people were also injured.",
      "According to prosecutors, Abedini is the founder and managing director of an Iranian company, San\u2019at Danesh Rahpooyan Aflak Co., or SDRA, which manufactures navigation modules used in the IRGC\u2019s military drone program.",
      "SDRA\u2019s main business is selling the navigation system to the IRGC, which are then used in unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as cruise and ballistic missiles.",
      "Sadeghi, on the other hand, is employed by a Massachusetts-based \u201cmicroelectronics manufacturer\u201d and is one of the founders of a Massachusetts-based technology company that specializes in \u201cwearable sensors that provide kinetic monitoring for fitness applications.\u201d He had received funding from the Iranian government for the company he helped found.",
      "The two men allegedly conspired to procure goods and technology from Sadeghi\u2019s place of work and exported them and supplied them to Iran to Abedini\u2019s Iranian company SDRA.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that \u201csince in or around 2016, on multiple occasions, Sadeghi has helped Abedini procure U.S. export-controlled electronic components for Abedini\u2019s use in Iran.\u201d",
      "Because the U.S. has laws restricting exports\u00a0to Iran, Abedini allegedly established a Switzerland front company for SDRA called Illumove SA.",
      "While both men are charged for violating U.S. export laws, Abedini is further charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, the IRGC Aerospace Force, which is the strategic missile, air and space force within the IRGC.",
      "\u201cSince at least in or about 2014, SDRA has had multiple projects with the IRGC Aerospace Force, including projects for guided rockets and integrated navigation systems. As alleged, between 2021 and 2022, approximately 99% of SDRA\u2019s sales of the Sepehr Navigation System, which are used in IRGC one-way attack drones, were to the IRGC\u2019s Aerospace Force,\u201d the news release said.",
      "Sadeghi was arrested Monday and is being held pending a detention hearing set for Dec. 27. Abedini was also arrested Monday in Italy at the request of the United States.",
      "NBC News has reached out to a public defender listed for Sadeghi. Abedini has not retained legal representation in the U.S. yet. It's not clear when he'll be brought to the U.S. to face charges.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland said the arrests demonstrate \u201cthat the Justice Department will hold accountable those who enable the Iranian regime to continue to target and kill Americans and undermine the national security of the United States.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly on Tuesday defeated New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the race to be the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, as rank-and-file lawmakers favored a more senior member of the party\u2019s caucus to take on the second Trump administration rather than a young progressive star.",
      "In a closed-door Democratic caucus meeting, the secret-ballot vote was 131 to 84, according to a lawmaker in the room.",
      "After the vote, Connolly told reporters the most \u201ccapable\u201d candidate won.",
      "\u201cAgain, I think my colleagues were measuring their votes by who\u2019s got experience, who\u2019s seasoned, who can be trusted, who\u2019s capable, and who\u2019s got a record of productivity. I think that prevailed,\u201d he said.",
      "Connolly said he\u2019s \u201cready\u201d to take on a Trump administration despite his recent health issues. President-elect Donald Trump, Connolly added, may feel more \"emboldened\" but that could make him more \"reckless.\"",
      "\"There is a law in this land, and we\u2019re going to make sure it\u2019s enforced,\u201d Connolly said.",
      "On the social media site Bluesky, Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Tuesday: \"Tried my best. Sorry I couldn\u2019t pull it through everyone \u2014 we live to fight another day.\"",
      "The vote came a day after the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which is closely aligned with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., backed Connolly over Ocasio-Cortez in a 34 to 27 vote, according to a source.",
      "The position opened up after the top Democrat on Oversight, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., challenged Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., for a similar post on the Judiciary Committee, prompting Nadler to bow out.",
      "The full Democratic caucus also ratified other steering panel recommendations on Tuesday. Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota was elected to be the top Democrat on the Agriculture Committee, beating Rep. Jim Costa of California, the second-most senior member of the panel. A day earlier in the steering committee, she secured 34 votes and beat out her two rivals on the first ballot\u2014 Costa got 22 votes, and Rep. David Scott of Georgia, who has held the top agriculture job since 2021, got just five.",
      "For the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, the steering committee recommended Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., over the more junior Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M. The vote was 44 to 17. Stansbury then dropped out of the race, and the full caucus elected Huffman to the post on Tuesday.",
      "The races for committee ranking member posts had been seen as a litmus test about the future of seniority in the Democratic Party as younger lawmakers clamored for new blood and generational change in the leadership.",
      "But this week\u2019s results yielded a mixed bag on that question.",
      "Connolly, 74, is a senior member of the Oversight Committee and was first elected to Congress in 2008. Even though he announced last month he had been diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus, he beat back a challenge from Ocasio-Cortez, 35, the progressive hero who was first elected in 2018.",
      "The more senior Democrat also won the steering committee\u2019s endorsement in the Natural Resources race. Huffman, 60, who was elected in 2012 and would be the second most senior Democrat on the committee next year, bested Stansbury, 45, a relatively junior member of the committee who won a special election in 2021.",
      "With Huffman\u2019s ascension to ranking member, Natural Resources will have a younger Democratic leader than in the past. Earlier, Huffman launched a surprise challenge to Rep. Raul Grijalva, of Arizona, 76, who was elected to Congress in 2002 and had been the committee\u2019s top Democrat since 2015.",
      "But in the Agriculture race, the younger insurgent prevailed. Craig, 52, a Democratic \u201cFrontliner\u201d and one of the panel\u2019s least senior members, knocked off the incumbent, Scott, 79, who was first elected in 1982 and had been suffering from health issues for years, and another senior member, Costa, 72, a third-generation farmer who was next in line in seniority after Scott.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to help us win back rural Americans and with them a strong Democratic majority,\u201d Craig said after the vote.",
      "At the same time, a number of senior Democrats who lead other committees didn't face any challenges and will keep their coveted jobs in the next Congress.",
      "Rep. Maxine Waters of California, 86, won another two years as top Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, while Rep. Greg Meeks of New York, 71, will stay on as top Democrat of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, 76, will remain ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York, 71, will keep her job as top Democrat on the Small Business Committee.",
      "While Democrats will remain in the minority in the new Congress that begins in January, the party committee leaders would wield enormous oversight power should Democrats retake control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump is suing Ann Selzer, her polling firm, The Des Moines Register and the newspaper's parent company, Gannett, accusing them of consumer fraud, according to a copy of the filing reviewed by NBC News.",
      "The suit, filed Monday night in Polk County, Iowa, says it seeks \u201caccountability for brazen election interference\u201d over a Nov. 2 poll that showed Kamala Harris up 3 percentage points in Iowa.",
      "Trump ultimately won the state by double digits, a difference that his lawyers argue in the suit constitutes \u201celection-interfering fiction.\u201d The president-elect is making the claim under the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act, which prohibits deceptive advertising.",
      "\"I\u2019m doing this because I feel I have an obligation to. I\u2019m going to be bringing one against the people in Iowa, their newspaper, which had a very, very good pollster who got me right all the time, and then just before the election, she said I was going to lose by 3 or 4  points,\" Trump said in discussing the suit on Monday.",
      "Selzer announced after the election that she would stop polling political contests and move into other ventures.",
      "When the Des Moines Register published the Selzer poll, Trump had been widely expected to win the state. The survey of 808 likely Iowa voters found Vice President Kamala Harris with 47% support compared to Trump with 44%.",
      "\u201cDefendants and their cohorts in the Democrat Party hoped that the Harris Poll would create a false narrative of inevitability for Harris in the final week of the 2024 Presidential Election,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "Shortly before the poll's release, a possible leak predicted its findings, ultimately prompting an internal probe.",
      "A spokesperson for the Des Moines Register said the newspaper stands by its reporting.",
      "\u201cWe have acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll did not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump\u2019s Election Day victory in Iowa by releasing the poll\u2019s full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unweighted data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer,\" the spokesperson, Lark-Marie Anton, said. \"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe this lawsuit is without merit.\u201d",
      "Selzer declined to comment.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest front in Trump\u2019s campaign against coverage by the media and analysts that he claims are biased. Trump secured a $15 million payout from ABC News, plus the payment of his lawyer\u2019s fees, totaling $1 million, in a defamation case over the weekend. Trump is also pursuing legal action against the Pulitzer Prize Board after it awarded prizes for stories about Russia and his 2016 campaign.",
      "Media law experts were skeptical the suit could achieve its aims in court but said it could have a chilling effect on the press.",
      "\u201cThe odds of success here are slim to\u00a0none, but winning in court is not likely the real goal of this lawsuit,\" said Clay Calvert, a media law expert and professor at the University of Florida's Levin College of Law. \"The true motivation is to intimidate the press and journalists.\u00a0I unfortunately suspect this lawsuit is just a harbinger of things to come.\u201d",
      "The suit states that \u201cMillions of Americans, including Plaintiff, residents of Iowa, and Iowans who contributed to President Trump\u2019s Campaign and its affiliated entities (the \u201cTrump 2024 Campaign\u201d), were deceived by the doctored Harris Poll\u201d and that the \u201cpolling \u2018miss\u2019 was not an astonishing coincidence \u2014 it was intentional.\u201d",
      "It attacks Selzer\u2019s reputation as a standard-bearing pollster, alleging that the polling miss showing Harris with a lead in Iowa that never materialized was intended to sway the race. The suit\u00a0argues a pattern by Selzer of attempting to influence political races in favor of Democrats and that her large platform offers \"a significant and impactful opportunity to deceive voters.\"",
      "Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA School of Law, quickly dismissed the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect this lawsuit to go anywhere,\u201d he wrote on his blog."

      "\"These letters share a common theme. Yes, there is disappointment, but there is also resolve for the future,\u201d she said, saying that young people are \"impatient for change\" and will \"not let anyone or any circumstance\" defeat their spirit or purpose.",
      "The vice president didn't mention Trump during her remarks, which garnered strong applause and cheers from the young audience.",
      "Several Maryland Democrats attended the event, including Gov. Wes Moore, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller and Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks. Harris won their state by more than 28 percentage points and Prince George's County by more than 74 percentage points.",
      "Following Trump's win, \"many people have come up to me, telling me they feel tired, maybe even resigned, folks who said to me that they\u2019re not sure whether they have the strength, much less the desire, to stay in the fight,\" Harris said.",
      "\"We must stay in the fight,\" she said. \"Every one of us.\"",
      "Harris encouraged people to get rest over the holidays and to return \"ready to march into the future\" and fight for opportunity and freedom.",
      "The vice president has largely remained out of the public eye since losing the general election to Trump in November.",
      "While Harris performed better among young voters overall, Trump made gains among voters under 30, particularly young men."

    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 00:14:56 GMT",
    "summary": "After learning that the bald eagle is not officially the national bird, an \"eaglevangelist\" is working with Congress to remedy that omission.",
    "story": [
      "WABASHA, Minn. \u2014\u00a0You would be excused if you thought this wasn\u2019t necessary, but the bald eagle is one step closer to being designated the national bird of the United States.",
      "Late one Monday evening back in July after most senators had already gone home for the day, a unanimous motion passed the Senate to slip the formal national bird designation into the U.S. code.",
      "\u201cWithout objection, it is so ordered,\u201d Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., moved to pass the bill with no one else in the chamber.",
      "Just like that, it was off to the House.",
      "The U.S. code already designates the oak tree as the national tree of the United States and the rose as the national flower, and Congress even voted in 2016 to deem the bison the national mammal, but the bald eagle is not the national bird of the U.S. \u2014 yet.",
      "Thanks to one man who discovered the omission, Congress is about to correct that. The House passed the bill Monday night, sending it to President Joe Biden to sign into law and formalize the bald eagle's national significance in one of Congress\u2019 last acts of the year.",
      "The 'eaglevangelist'",
      "The bald eagle is a particular passion in Wabasha, Minnesota, where the National Eagle Center sits on the bank of the Mississippi River. The self-designated \u201cEagle Capital of America,\u201d the city has a population of about 1,500 people, including one person who has dedicated his life to the bald eagle\u2019s legacy.",
      "Preston Cook is, to put it mildly, obsessed with bald eagles.",
      "\u201cI saw a movie called \u2018A Thousand Clowns\u2019 in 1966 and there was one line in the movie, \u2018You can\u2019t have too many eagles,\u2019\u201d Cook said. \u201cI walked out of the theater and I said that might be an interesting thing to collect.\u201d",
      "So, he started collecting and collecting and collecting. Over the decades, Cook\u2019s trove has ballooned to over 40,000 items, a collection that he believes is the largest in the country.",
      "\u201cIf it had an eagle on it, I\u2019d buy it,\u201d Cook said, \u201cI may have gotten a little carried away in my collecting here, but I\u2019ve loved the whole process.\u201d",
      "The collection lives in two warehouses just steps from the Mississippi River and ranges from political pins to paintings and magazine covers to playing cards. There are lego sets and sculptures, ginger beer bottles and eagle bedazzled stilettos.",
      "The collection became so big that Cook began looking for a place to put it. It found a home in the National Eagle Center in Wabasha.",
      "He also decided to turn his collection into a book, and while researching the eagle\u2019s place in American history, he came to a realization.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a national bird,\u201d Cook said.",
      "The turkey myth",
      "The omission came as a shock to the staff at the National Eagle Center, who thought the honor had already been bestowed on the bird that nests in the trees surrounding their headquarters. Minnesota has the second-largest nesting population of bald eagles in the country, trailing only Alaska.",
      "\u201cPreston Cook brought that up to us years ago, and it was like, \u2018Oh, come on, you\u2019re kidding me,\u2019\u201d said Scott Mehus, the education director at the National Eagle Center. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking in classes all of these years, telling [people] it\u2019s our nation\u2019s symbol and our national bird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong all these years and so has everybody else in the country,\u201d Mehus said.",
      "The bald eagle became the nation\u2019s most prominent bird when it was placed on the great seal shortly after the country\u2019s founding. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who were originally tasked with the responsibility, were unable to agree to a seal to represent the country, so in 1782, Secretary of the Continental Congress Charles Thomson submitted a version with the bald eagle, which was approved later that year. The eagle-emblazoned seal was first used on a document authorizing George Washington to negotiate a prisoner-of-war exchange and has been a national symbol since.",
      "But not all of the Founding Fathers were fans of the eagle. Franklin famously wrote in a letter to his daughter that he wished the eagle had not been chosen as the representative for the United States, calling it \u201ca bird of bad moral character\u201d and adding, \u201cHe does not get his living honestly.\u201d",
      "Franklin went on to say in his letter that \u201cthe Turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original Native of America.\u201d",
      "But it's a myth that Franklin led discussions about making the turkey the national bird; historians believe he was joking. \u201cHe never advocated for the turkey to be our great seal,\u201d Scott said, though he admitted Franklin made some negative comments about the eagle.",
      "The bill",
      "\u201cThis is one of those few laws that\u2019s going to make no difference,\u201d Cook jokes.",
      "The bill Cook himself initially wrote and sent to Congress has no money attached to it; it doesn\u2019t even assist in conservation efforts related to bald eagles. It simply slips a line into the U.S. code between the national tree and the guidelines for inaugural ceremonies that says, \u201cThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the national bird.\u201d",
      "He sent the bill to the offices of Minnesota lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, and a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., brought it to the floor to be passed unanimously in the upper chamber.",
      "\u201cThey are the ones that came to us and said it\u2019s not the national bird,\u201d Klobuchar said of the National Eagle Center and Cook. \u201cSo that was the impetus.\u201d",
      "It takes an act of Congress and the president's signature to designate any item with the \u201cnational\u201d title; the rose got the honor in 1986 and the oak tree in 2004.",
      "\u201cNo one has to change anything; it\u2019s just a correction. It is only a correction in history to make things right and makes things the way they should be,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was one of those little pieces of history that I felt should be taken care of, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "The blazer",
      "Cook doesn\u2019t literally wear his passion for eagles on his sleeve, but it\u2019s close. He wears a bow tie embroidered with an eagle and an eagle pin on his lapel, and eagles even fly on his red, white and blue suspenders.",
      "When you ask him what his most prized eagle possession is, he points to the buttons he received when he was drafted into the Army in the 1960s, which are now sewn onto the blue blazer he wears often.",
      "\u201cI was issued these buttons on my dress uniform that has the great seal. Two years later, I got out, snipped the buttons off my military uniform, and I\u2019ve been wearing them ever since,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the first items in my collection, and that gave me a start on collecting eagles for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "He looks at tables covered with old magazine covers showing caricatures of eagles flying away with small children in their talons and admits he hasn\u2019t stopped gathering items, calling it \u201ca working collection.\u201d He cycles the items through exhibits for children and interested visitors to look at in the National Eagle Center, but jokes: \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife that I\u2019m still collecting.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy wife has been very tolerant, and I appreciate her for that,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, she will say, \u2018You have too many eagles.\u2019 Occasionally, she\u2019ll say that.\u201d",
      "But just like legislating, marriage is about compromise, and even Cook\u2019s household has its limits.",
      "\u201cShe says, \u2018You can put them wherever you want in the house, but you cannot put them in the bedroom,\u2019\u201d Cook said with a laugh. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I can live with that one.\u2019\u201d"

    "title": "Outgoing Sen. Sherrod Brown talks of rescuing a 'corporate' Democratic Party",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:31:38 GMT",
    "summary": "Outgoing Sen. Sherrod Brown talked to NBC News about his \"post-Senate mission\" to reorient Democrats as the \"party of workers\" in Middle America.",
    "story": [
      "CLEVELAND \u2014 Fresh off a comfortable re-election victory in 2018, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, considered running for president on a populist message aimed at the many working-class Midwest voters who had fled the Democratic Party in favor of Donald Trump.",
      "Brown passed on the White House campaign. Now, six years later, he is soon to be unemployed, having recently lost his bid for a fourth Senate term. It will be the first time since 1992 \u2014 and only the second time since 1974 \u2014 that he will not hold an elected office.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, will return to the presidency next month, and the existential challenges are already roaring back for Brown and the Democrats. The party also lost a Senate seat in Pennsylvania while barely holding onto two others, in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump flipped all three of those \u201cblue wall\u201d states in November and won Ohio by a commanding margin.",
      "The challenges ring true to Brown, 72, who has been warning about them for years, dating to his staunch opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, as a House member. And, despite his defeat, Brown\u2019s perch in a part of the country where Democrats are a tarnished brand presents him with the opportunity to have a vocal role in the party if he wants one.",
      "In a recent interview with NBC News, Brown talked like someone who does. He spoke of a \u201cpost-Senate mission\u201d to reorient Democrats as the \u201cparty of workers\u201d in Middle America. He also revealed that he has received calls from people encouraging him to run for chair of the Democratic National Committee, though he added that the position does not interest him.",
      "\u201cBeing the national chair, you have a platform,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou also have to run an organization with 50 state chairs. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to spend my time on an airplane raising money.\u201d",
      "But Brown\u2019s post-Senate mission could lead him back to the Senate. He left the door open to running for office again in 2026, when Ohio will hold a special election to fill the remainder of Vice President-elect JD Vance\u2019s term. Brown also is noticeably describing the final remarks he plans to deliver in the Senate Tuesday afternoon as his \u201clast\u201d speech \u2014 not as a \u201cfarewell,\u201d as such speeches from outgoing senators are commonly known.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not making decisions yet on that,\u201d Brown replied when asked if he was already considering a comeback in 2026, when Ohio also will elect a new governor. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d",
      "For now, Brown is unleashing stinging critiques about his party.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to whine about my loss,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I lost in large part because the national reputation of the Democratic Party is that we are sort of a lighter version of a corporation \u2014 a corporate party. We\u2019re seen as a bicoastal, elite party. And it\u2019s hard to argue that.\u201d",
      "Brown then added: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t pass the minimum wage because Republicans almost uniformly were against it. It\u2019s always Republicans who are on the wrong side, and there aren\u2019t enough Democrats on the right side to win. \u2026 It\u2019s a good example of how workers get screwed.\u201d",
      "Even after his loss to Republican Bernie Moreno this fall, no Democrat in the state has anywhere close to Brown's track record of name-recognition or electoral success. He outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, by 7.5 percentage points in Ohio. Brown\u2019s allies believe that he had coattails that helped endangered Democratic Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes hold onto their congressional seats in tough districts.",
      "Brown, for his part, has been reciting the 7.5-point figure with an almost cosmic reverence. While dissecting trade policy, for example, he argued that both parties had \u201cganged up on workers\u201d while asserting that Ohio voters trust him more than other Democrats on those issues.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve won elections in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s why I finished 7-and-a-half points ahead of Harris. Harris won the union vote [in Ohio] by like 1 point. I won it by like 20.\u201d",
      "Moreno and his allies emphasized other issues in the Senate race, including immigration and border security, as well as the debate over transgender rights and transition-related medical care. One ad mocked Brown for supporting the use of pronouns like they and them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not wrong that Democrats have forgotten how to talk about workers,\u201d Jai Chabria, a Vance adviser and veteran Republican strategist in Ohio, said of Brown. \u201cBut he also doesn\u2019t accept blame for their cultural war failings, because he\u2019s part of that. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that working-class voters have been willing to look away from the Democratic Party. It\u2019s not just union issues, and it\u2019s not just NAFTA. It\u2019s a lot of things that regular people care about.\u201d",
      "Few votes factor more into Brown\u2019s political legacy than his 1993 vote against NAFTA, a trade pact involving Canada and Mexico that accelerated the outsourcing of jobs and the decline of U.S. manufacturing towns. Brown talks of NAFTA like it\u2019s an original sin for his party \u2014 the moment Democrats began losing the working class.",
      "He recalled how, as lobbying for the bill intensified, an employee at a Washington-area airport marveled to him how they had never seen so many corporate jets parked there. He also remembered how then-Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., who at the time was whipping support for NAFTA, had grumbled to him about losing votes after members returned home to their districts for recess and heard negative feedback from their constituents.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Bill, well, maybe we ought to listen to what the voters want on this,\u2019\u201d Brown recalled.",
      "Even though more Democrats voted against it than for it, their help in ratifying the deal has not been forgotten in working-class parts of Ohio like Dayton and the Mahoning Valley, which includes Youngstown and since 2016 has swung from Democratic stronghold to Trump stomping ground.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more acute in the Mahoning Valley,\u201d said Brown, who lost the region\u2019s anchoring counties, Mahoning and Trumbull \u2014 but by much smaller margins than Harris did.",
      "Regarded as an unflappable liberal earlier in his Senate career, Brown\u2019s flirtations with a 2020 presidential campaign came with a more nuanced tone. He preached pragmatism and incrementalism at a time other would-be nominees were demanding Medicare for All. His core message as he toured early voting states like Iowa centered on \u201cthe dignity of work.\u201d",
      "During his recent re-election race, Brown played up his relationships with Republicans and his populist stance on trade. His super PAC allies emphasized his agreement with Trump on anti-opioid legislation and other policy issues. In the final hours of the campaign, Brown campaigned with former President Bill Clinton, the Democrat who signed NAFTA into law.",
      "Brown said he had no advice for Democrats trying to gauge when to push back on Trump and when to work with him, reaching instead for a campaign soundbite \u2014 that politics should not be about the left or the right: \u201cIt\u2019s really whose side are you on?\u201d",
      "He added that he hoped senators would cast a more skeptical look at Trump\u2019s choice for labor secretary, Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer. The Oregon Republican is known for her labor-friendly views, including co-sponsorship of a bill that would protect union organizing rights. But Brown stressed that expanded overtime pay \u2014 a Biden administration initiative recently thwarted by a Trump-nominated judge in Texas \u2014 might be a better barometer on where she stands on key workers issues.",
      "\u201cThey say she\u2019s better than others, or other Republicans, on labor,\u201d Brown said. \u201cShe\u2019s had a couple of good votes, I guess. But they\u2019ve got to pin her down: Are you going to fix the overtime?\u201d",
      "Brown was reflective at other points during the interview, calling March 6, 2021 \u2014 the day the Senate passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan \u2014 as his most meaningful moment in Congress. The far-reaching legislation included the Brown-championed Butch Lewis Act, which was named for an Ohio Teamster and protected pension benefits for workers and retirees.",
      "\u201cDemocrats need to celebrate those victories and celebrate work that way,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd if you do that \u2014 it\u2019s what we should do \u2014 it\u2019s how we win elections.\u201d"

      "In a statement to CNBC, Starbucks disputed the union\u2019s characterization and said the company remains committed to reaching a final framework agreement.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing that the union is considering a strike rather than focusing on what have been extremely productive negotiations. Since April we\u2019ve scheduled and attended more than eight multi-day bargaining sessions where we\u2019ve reached thirty meaningful agreements on dozens of topics Workers United delegates told us were important to them, including many economic issues,\u201d the company said in the statement.",
      "The strike authorization shows that relations between the two sides may again be cooling, after thawing in late February when\u00a0both parties said\u00a0they found a \u201cconstructive path forward\u201d though mediation. Prior to that point, Starbucks had fought the union boom that swept across its company-owned locations for more than two years.

      "Earlier this year, the House passed the Transparency in Charges for Key Events Ticketing, or TICKET, Act. The bill would require ticket sellers to disclose the all-in cost of a ticket including fees. The TICKET Act has yet to be voted on in the Senate."

      "Instead, a week later San Francisco police announced the arrest of Momeni, 40, who is not a repeat offender and whose sister was friends with Lee.",

They\u2019re also supremely comfortable and work for people with narrow or wide feet. The only downside to these boots? They tend to get dirty \u2014 especially if you wear them in the sludge. And because Uggs are made of suede, you can\u2019t just toss them in the washing machine. In other words, you have to be careful with how you clean them so you don\u2019t ruin them.",

      "Maybe you stepped in a muddy puddle or your Uggs are dirty from last year\u2019s wear. Whatever the case, if you\u2019re ready to clean your boots, you\u2019ll want to do so with care. \u201cThey\u2019re made of suede, which can be difficult to care for,\u201d says William Wong, director of Arterton, which specializes in garment bags and shoe care tools. \u201cBut, when done right, cleaning can make them look better, retain their color and increase their longevity.\u201d Below are the steps our experts recommend you follow when you clean your Uggs.",
      "Step one: Start by brushing your boots with a suede brush. \u201cThis type of brush has rigid bristles so that the nap (or the texture) of the material is raised when you run it over the shoe and dust gets brushed off,\u201d says Wong. You want to brush in downward motions to go with the suede\u2019s grain, rather than against it.",

      "Ugg boots are lined with soft sheepskin, which can make it tempting to skip socks when wearing them. Of course, if you do that, your feet may sweat and eventually lead to the inside of your shoes smelling a little funky. Also, the fluffy sheepskin can eventually flatten out and get matted. The experts we spoke to suggested sprinkling a few teaspoons of baking soda inside your boots to neutralize any unpleasant scents. Let the baking soda sit overnight, then use your suede brush to brush the baking soda out and fluff the sheepskin back up.",
      "How to protect your Uggs",
      "Knowing how to clean your Uggs is important. Equally important is protecting them from getting super dirty in the first place. One of the best things you can do to prevent stains and damage is to spray the suede down with a protective spray regularly, Eric Neuner, CEO of the shoe repair company NuShoe. These sprays repel water and other liquids that may stain your Uggs.",
      "Before applying a suede protector, test it on a small area to ensure it works with your boots. From there, Neuner says you\u2019ll need to apply the protector semi-regularly. How often, really depends on the frequency in which you wear your Uggs. If you only wear them occasionally, once or twice a year should work. If you wear them all the time, opt for once a month. By regularly using a protector, you should have to clean your Uggs a bit less frequently.",

      "The agreement between CrowdStrike and Delta includes a clause limiting CrowdStrike\u2019s liability and a cap on damages, which the cybersecurity provider says Delta is now trying to skirt. CrowdStrike also argued in its filing that Georgia law prevents Delta from converting a breach of contract into tort claims.",
      "\u201cAs an initial matter,\u00a0Georgia\u2019s economic loss rule specifically precludes Delta\u2019s efforts to recover through tort claims the economic damages it claims to have suffered,\u201d CrowdStrike wrote.",
      "Delta said the July cybersecurity outage cost the company more than $500 million in canceled flights, refunds and passenger accommodations. It is seeking to recoup those costs from CrowdStrike through the suit. But the damage done to Delta\u2019s reputation as a premium carrier can\u2019t yet be quantified, nor has the impact of a Department of Transportation investigation into Delta over the outage.",
      "Delta continues to rely on CrowdStrike services following the outage, likely because it is extremely difficult to change cybersecurity providers in systems as large and complicated as Delta\u2019s.",
      "Still, CrowdStrike said it moved quickly to try and help Delta \u2014 offers the cybersecurity company says were rebuffed. \u201cWe are good for now,\u201d one message from a Delta executive cited by CrowdStrike read. The cybersecurity company said its executives were in close contact on the day of the outage.",
      "\u201cDelta repeatedly rebuffed any assistance from CrowdStrike or its partners,\u201d CrowdStrike wrote.",
      "CrowdStrike further argues that Delta\u2019s own practices and systems led to the widespread delays and cancellations, unlike other industry peers who recovered much more quickly from the outage.",
      "\u201cDelta was an outlier. Although Delta acknowledges that it took just hours\u2014not days\u2014for Delta employees to\u201d remediate the outage, CrowdStrike wrote in its filing, \u201ccancellations far exceeded the flight disruptions its peer airlines experienced.\u201d",
      "The cybersecurity company\u2019s stock took a sharp hit after the outage, plunging 44%. It\u2019s since largely recovered from those losses, posting strong quarterly results even after lowering its guidance due to the incident.

      "Between acts, there's a time jump, although how much time exactly is unclear. (The 1995 book by Gregory Maguire, which has a markedly different tone and adult audience, would suggest it's a period of about five years.)",
      "In the musical, Act 2 opens with the song \"Thank Goodness,\" sung primarily by Glinda and Madame Morrible, played by Ariana Grande and Michelle Yeoh in the film.",
      "The song establishes that Glinda has left Shiz University and has officially assumed the mantle of Glinda the Good, meant to uplift spirits, while the rest of Oz is overwhelmed by fear of the Wicked Witch of the West, the enemy of the Wizard. She also announces that she and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey in the 2024 film), now a captain in the Wizard's army, are officially engaged.",

      "Glinda then finds herself the third prong of the love triangle and sings a reprise of \"I'm Not That Girl.\" Meanwhile, Fiyero and Elphaba profess their love to the steamy song \"As Long As You're Mine.\"",

      "Desperate to make him love her, Nessarose tries to use Elphaba's spell book, the Grimmerie, but her enchantment goes wrong and she shrinks his heart. To save him, Elphaba turns him into a man made of tin so he can survive without a heart. Nessarose then proclaims herself the Wicked Witch of the East.",
      "Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose who uses a wheelchair in real life. She told TODAY's Donna Farizan in an interview that while she can't say too much about Part 2, \"it is definitely less of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\"",
      "Bode also confirms to TODAY.com that in \"Wicked: For Good\" her character plays a bigger role in the story. Her character undergoes almost a 180-degree change from the end of Part 1, which sees her happy and in love with Boq, to the start of Part 2.",
      "\"What was helpful to me was journaling as my character to fill in a lot of the blanks and to really get in the mindset (of) why my character changed, what her feelings were in the in between and how did she get to where she was today,\" Bode says.",

      "\u201cI never thought about the number,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar while discussing her weight-loss journey in 2016. \u201cWhen I started seeing that I could lose weight\u2014because I just thought my body would never change\u2014I started taking it more seriously and eating better.\u201d",
      "She's realistic about pregnancy weight gain",
      "There's no one-size-fits-all approach to losing weight after giving birth. In 2019, Kardashian opened up about her 40-pound weight gain while she was pregnant with her daughter True, who was born in 2018. She also shares son Tatum, 2, with her former partner Tristan Thompson.",
      "\u201cI was\u00a0203 pounds when I delivered, which blows my mind,\u201d she told her mom Kris Jenner during a clip from her show \u201cRevenge Body with Khloe Kardashian.\u201d \u201cYou think you\u2019re going to have a baby and all of it\u2019s going to come out, and then you leave the hospital and you\u2019re like, \u2018What is going on?

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 14:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "For the 35-year anniversary of \"When Harry Met Sally,\" we revisited the key question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends?",
    "story": [
      "Thirty-five years ago, the world was introduced to Harry Burns and Sally Albright, two bumbling New Yorkers who fall in and out of each other's lives before finding love 12 years after meeting.",
      "\"When Harry Met Sally...\" has since given pop culture memorable lines like \"I'll have what she's having,\" fashion touchstones like Harry's sweater and trends like \"Meg Ryan fall.\"",
      "Billy Crystal reflected on the film's endurance on Sunday TODAY, saying \"there\u2019s so much truth and love in that movie.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s so much romance in that movie. There\u2019s so much confusion in that movie about relationships that that\u2019s an eternal situation for people,\" he told Willie Geist for the Dec. 15 edition of \"Sunday Sitdown.\" \"And young kids now, they\u2019re into the phase of their life where they may be falling in love and, 'Is this the right thing?' It took Harry and Sally 12 years to figure it out, you know?\"",
      "The film's tagline notably posed a philosophical, even existential, question: \"Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?\"",
      "The question is explored both in the story's plot and its dialogue. After meeting via a carpool from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry and Sally bump into each other over the years before striking up a friendship. Whether or not their relationship can stay platonic becomes the driving force of the film.",
      "Harry argues, in one of their earliest run-ins, that men and women can't just be friends \"because the sex part always gets in the way.\" And at the risk of spoiling the 35-year-old film, he's seemingly proven right by the end.",
      "After Sally hears that her ex-boyfriend is getting married, she tearfully calls Harry. When he comes over to console her, the pair sleep together for the first time and find themselves on vastly different pages the next morning: Harry wants to go back to being friends, and Sally tries to end their friendship forever.",
      "In the movie's finale, Harry sprints in the snow to profess his love to Sally at a New Year's Eve party, a scene that some on X have recently said \"literally changed the trajectory\" of their lives.",
      "The movie's screenwriter, Nora Ephron, who died in 2012, said that the film wasn't about answering the question, \"Can men and women be friends?\" Instead, the movie is about the differences in how men and women view friendship, she wrote in the introduction to a 1990 printing of the script, per Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that men don\u2019t want to be friends with women. Men know they don\u2019t understand women, and they don\u2019t much care. They want women as lovers, as wives, as mothers, but they\u2019re really not interested in them as friends. They have friends,\" she said.",
      "\"Women, on the other hand, are dying to be friends with men. Women know they don\u2019t understand men, and it bothers them: they think that if only they could be friends with them, they would understand them,\" she added.",
      "But how would that question be answered now?",
      "We asked some of the most popular authors today for their take on the core question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends? Or, updated for 2024, can two people who are attracted to each other just be friends?",
      "Here's what they said.",
      "Emily Henry",
      "Emily Henry is the author of several romance novels, including \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which she's described as an homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Book Lovers,\" featuring a main character named Nora Stephens, after Ephron.",
      "\"People We Meet on Vacation,\" currently being adapted for a film starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, follows Poppy and Alex and their friendship from college to adulthood, sustained through annual vacations.",
      "On the question of whether two people attracted to each other can just be friends, Henry says, \"I actually do think so.\"",
      "\"I think Poppy and Alex could have stayed friends, they just had to make the decision,\" she says. \"You can't be half-in and half-out, you have to make the decision and really commit to it.",
      "\"For a lot of us, attraction comes and goes, but friendship is forever,\" she adds. \"I wonder what Nora would actually say because the movie, it's like they get together, but was she really saying they can't (be friends), or was she just saying these people belong to each other? I wish I could ask her.\"",
      "Yulin Kuang",
      "Speaking of the \"People We Meet on Vacation\" film adaptation, the screenplay for that project was written by Yulin Kuang. She's also set to direct the adaptation of Henry's \"Beach Read,\" and in April she published her debut romance novel, \"How to End a Love Story.\"",
      "Kuang says she's a huge \"When Harry Met Sally...\" fan.",
      "\"I have never lived in a world without it, which feels correct,\" she says.",
      "In fact, the writer had the \"When Harry Met Sally...\" screenplay printed out and kept it on her desk, \"so I could absorb its energy by osmosis.\"",
      "Looking back on it now, she gives a clear answer on the film's question.",
      "\"Can men and women be friends? Yes,\" she says. \"Can two people who are attracted to each other \u2014 that one gives me pause.\"",
      "\"Yes, but if I was very attracted to (a friend), I would have to do some unpacking about that in therapy,\" she adds. \"If it was getting to the point of, 'We're in crush territory,' I think that would be a little dangerous.\"",
      "As to how the film answers its own question, Kuang described it as a \"specific story,\" rather than a generalization. Because both characters feel relatable, like real people pulled from the world, it's understandable to view the movie as a commentary on men and women, she says.",
      "\"But ultimately, it's really just a commentary on Harry and Sally,\" she says.",
      "Kennedy Ryan",
      "Kennedy Ryan is the author of more than 20 books, including \"Reel\" and the upcoming conclusion to her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "Ryan says \"When Harry Met Sally...\" is an example of \"nailing the happily ever after\" with the New Year's Eve love confession and kiss.",
      "\"That's like, hall of fame happily ever after,\" she says.",
      "Like Henry and Kuang, she thinks people who are attracted to each other can stay friends \u2014 but \"it can be complicated.\"",
      "\"I say that just because I have several friends who are guys who I've known for years,\" she says. \"Now, I also have had friends who were guys who, it didn't work out that way, where you thought that it would be fine being platonic, and then one catches feelings for the other, and then it gets complicated, and you can get really hurt and lose friendships that way.\"",
      "She maintains it's possible with specific boundaries.",
      "\"I think it just comes down to being clear about what you both want and when things shift, being honest about that,\" she says.",
      "It also depends on if you find them attractive, or, if you're attracted to them.",
      "\"If you are attracted to someone, and I say this as a romance novelist \u2014 like, I live by this stuff \u2014 it's the draw, it's the pull, and that's something that, if it's strong enough, it's hard to ignore,\" she says. \"But also, if you are attracted to someone, you have to ask, why is this not a romantic relationship? And when you interrogate that, maybe it helps you deal with the attraction.\"",
      "Tia Williams",
      "Tia Williams is the author of the romance novel \"Seven Days In June\" and 2024's \"A Love Song for Ricki Wilde.\"",
      "Williams calls \"When Harry Met Sally...\" a comfort movie.",
      "She says she remembers seeing \"When Harry Met Sally...\" in theaters when she was 13 and was struck by the film's central question.",
      "\"Back then, friendship was \u2014 everything was defined in very restrictive terms and put in these very traditional buckets,\" she says. \"If you're friends, that's platonic. It means you're not having sex, and you never will.",
      "\"But I think that the idea of friendship has evolved. I mean, when we get to 'Sex and the City,' we have the idea of f--- buddies, and people that you aren't pursuing a relationship with that you're really just friends with, that you're also having sex with,\" she adds.",
      "She describes the film's essential question as, \"Can you platonically be friends with someone that you are attracted to?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you can,\" she says. \"I don't think there's any way to be platonic friends with someone that you desperately want to have sex with.\"",
      "She argues if one is attracted to a friend, the dynamic can no longer be described as platonic.",
      "While having the friendship between Harry and Sally inevitably turn into a relationship may seem \"puritanical\" \u2014 \"if you're attracted, you have to be lovers\" \u2014 Williams argues the film's depiction of romance  defied gender normative roles of men and women not understanding each other.",
      "\"It's showing there's friendship within a relationship,\" she says. \"In 'When Harry Met Sally...' they were actually friends for years, and then fell in love. Women are people. Men are people. We can have friendship, respect.\"",
      "But, \"they were never going to be just friends,\" she adds.",
      "Emma Straub",
      "Emma Straub is the author of the novels \"Modern Lovers,\" \"The Vacationers,\" \"This Time Tomorrow\" and more.",
      "Straub, who grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, describes \"When Harry Met Sally...\" as a \"tour of my childhood.\"",
      "\"I would love for every rom-com to be this smart and funny and let its characters read books. Harry is often reading books in this movie and that is meaningful to me. And they just have smart conversations,\" she says.",
      "She says \"of course\" men and women can be friends, and so can two people who are attracted to each other.",
      "\"I think if the circumstances had been different their friendship would have continued for the rest of their lives, quite happily,\" she says. \"I feel like it's a very boring answer, but I think yes.\"",
      "\"I feel like I have a lot of male friends, and so I believe that of course it's possible, even with someone as absolutely charming as Billy Crystal,\" she adds. \"I think I could absolutely just be friends with Billy Crystal.\"",
      "And while the film ends with Harry and Sally in a romantic relationship, she argues the film \"does actually prove that men and women can be friends \u2014 I'm willing to say it,\" she says.",
      "\"What I believe to be true is that romance is really about timing,\" she says. \"That's what you see in the movie. There are all of these misses in terms of timing for them, and then the timing is right. But it doesn't mean in the multiverse, in the Harry and Sally multiverse, that it always would be.\"",
      "Jasmine Guillory",
      "Jasmine Guillory, whose next book, \"Flirting Lessons,\" comes out in April 2025, is the author of nine romance books, including \"The Wedding Date.\"",
      "Guillory says \"absolutely\" people who are attracted to each other can be friends, because attraction isn't the only determining factor of whether or not a relationship can work.",
      "\"I'm attracted to so many people who I recognize that our relationship is perfect as it is, and I would never want to do anything to it,\" Guillory says.",
      "The film also shows that a person can be attracted to someone, but not meant for them \u2014 or at least, that version of them.",
      "\"Yes, (Harry and Sally) are meant for each other. But at the beginning of the movie, they aren't. And I think that happens in life, right?\" she says.",
      "\"There are people who you may have known 10 years ago who, if you had had a relationship then, it would be terrible, but now it's perfect,\" she says."

    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",

      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",
      "Some marquise cut-wearers are happy Gomez joined the club. A TikToker posted a video with the text, \"Now me and Selena have the same Marquise Diamond ring.\"",

      "The video began with screenshots from anonymous commenters online making derogatory remarks about the actor and her appearance. The comments seemed to be surrounding new photos that were published online of the actor donning a bikini at her home in Florida.",
      "Without captioning the video, she highlighted dozens of comments blasting her looks, including one that read, \u201cShe is extraordinarily average, which is why she always makes sure her chest is the first thing to enter any room.\u201d",
      "\u201cWas she playing the live action role of miss Piggy?\u201d another comment read.",

      "\"Yes, this is me,\" she said, nodding while holding up her phone. \"This is a photo of me from my SI Swim photoshoot and I look amazing.\"",
      "\"Is it maybe a little self-absorbed to have this on the back of my phone?\" she continued, laughing. \"Maybe. Maybe it is. But when you look this good, it's good to just keep looking at it.\"",
      "The athlete, who's become as known for her sense of humor as her skill on the field, went on.",

      "\u201cBMI doesn\u2019t really tell you what I can do. It doesn\u2019t tell you what I do on the field, how fit I am,\u201d Maher continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just a couple numbers put together. It doesn\u2019t tell you how much muscle I have or anything like that.",
      "\"So yeah, I do have a BMI of 30. I am considered overweight,\" she added. \"But alas, I\u2019m going to the Olympics and you\u2019re not.\""

    "summary": "Mary is sparking debate in the religious community and casting. Here's what to know about criticism from viewers and Biblical scholars.",
    "story": [
      "A new movie about the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is sparking debate among viewers and religious scholars alike.",
      "\u201cMary,\u201d a Biblical epic streaming now on Netflix, tells the story of the Nativity through the eyes of Mary of Nazareth (Noa Cohen). The film follows Mary, Joseph (Ido Tako) and the newborn Jesus as they escape persecution from King Herod (Anthony Hopkins).",
      "\u201cMary is the most extraordinary woman ever to walk this earth, yet her story remains largely unknown beyond a few passages in the Bible,\u201d director D.J. Caruso told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "\u201cI embarked on this journey \u2014 to create a film that presents her in her most human and relatable form,\u201d he continued, adding that his aim was \u201cto portray Mary as someone we can all connect with, not just as a saint but as the young woman we all recognize before her sanctification.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe said her intention was to make Mary and Joseph\u2019s story \u201crelatable,\u201d speaking to\u00a0The Christian Post, and tell a story of a \u201cyoung girl becoming a woman in the midst of such divine expectations.\u201d",
      "While some viewers are praising the film, which has been in Netflix\u2019s Top 10 for much of the time since its debut on the streaming platform Dec. 6, others have objected to what they views as the movie\u2019s Biblical and historical inaccuracies. Others have objected to the casting.",
      "What religious scholars are saying about \u2018Mary\u2019",
      "Religious scholars have had mixed reactions to \u201cMary,\u201d as they debate perceived inaccuracies in the portrayal.",
      "Christy Cobb, a assistant professor of Christianity in the department of religious studies at the University of Denver, says the field of Biblical studies has been alight with discussions about the film. She first heard about \u201cMary\u201d through a post on Facebook \u2014 \u201ca rant post,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBiblical scholars are hearing about these movies, and then we get excited, and then when we watch it, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t depicting Biblical stories as accurately or historical moments as accurately as we hope that they would be,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d about Mary in the Bible, Cobb says. Aspects of Mary\u2019s character in the movie are based on passages of the New Testament (the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke) and an early Christian text called the Proto Gospel of James.",
      "Filmmakers took creative liberties with Mary's depiction, Cobb says. Cobb appreciated that the film's Mary is more \u201cfiery and rebellious\u201d than commonly depicted. \u201cI like that we\u2019re depicting Mary as this full character with some agency, courage and her fears at the surface,\u201d she says.",
      "But other historical inaccuracies stood out.",
      "The movie places modern conservative family values onto the Holy Family in a way that is \u201cnot supported by the text\u201d or by historical context, Cobb, who is working on a book about early Christian families, says.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Family was depicted (in the movie) as a nuclear family. Joseph is immediately supportive of Mary and will protect Mary at all costs,\u201d she says.",
      "The Bible, however, says that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary. Families also \u201clooked quite different\u201d in that era than they do today, Cobb says. Divorces were common and there would have been more people living in the household than depicted in \u201cMary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Bible, all sorts of families are represented, not just one view of a family system,\u201d she says.",
      "The result, Cobb says, is \u201cwe\u2019re having the the debate about what a Christian family (should) look like, superimposed upon this film.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe, speaking to Christian Post, said that script approval came from \u201ca range of religious leaders\u201d to \u201censure authenticity.\u201d",
      "However, only one person, Adam W. Schindler, is listed as a Biblical consultant on IMDB. Schindler is a pastor and the chief digital officer of the conservative nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute, founded by two former advisors to president Donald Trump. The movie is funded, in part, by megachurch pastor Joel Osteen, per IMDB.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Aloe Entertainment, Schindler and Caruso for comment about script consultants.",
      "Other aspects of the movie \u2014 including Mary\u2019s more down-to-earth characterization \u2014 are sparking debate for straying from doctrine.",
      "Some Catholic commentators have objected to the depiction of Mary\u2019s labor pains during the birth of Jesus, because showing Mary suffering during childbirth \u201cdoes not comport with Catholic teaching,\u201d Joseph Pronechen wrote in a review for the National Catholic Register.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Fathers and doctors of the Church, including Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, have taught that Mary alone would be exempt from such pains as a sign of her unique holiness,\u201d he sayss in his review. \u201cShe alone had no original sin.\u201d",
      "Caruso addressed his choice to show Mary in pain during labor in a recent interview with Christianity Today.",
      "\u201cRegarding the labor pains: That\u2019s about presenting Mary in a human way, acknowledging that she had apprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something like a third of women died in childbirth in antiquity.\u201d",
      "Nathanael Andrade, a chair and professor of history at Binghamton University, who has written a forthcoming book about the crucifixion of Jesus, also pointed out a \u201cserious problem\u201d for movies like \u201cMary\u201d and others that portray the life of Jesus.",
      "\u201cThe often portray everyone in ancient Jewish society that did not support Jesus as nurturing base or corrupt motivations. Such films run a serious risk of feeding pernicious anti-Semitic attitudes,\u201d he said in an email statement to TODAY.com.",
      "Why the casting of Mary also stirred up controversy",
      "\u201cMary\u201d ruffled feathers outside of the religious community. Some people have objected to the casting of Noa Cohen, a Jewish Israeli actor, as Mary. Several other actors in the movie, including Ido Tako, who plays Joseph, and Keren Tzur, who plays Elizabeth, are also Israeli.",
      "The real Mary was believed to be a Jewish woman from Nazareth, Galilee. At the time of Mary\u2019s birth, Galilee was a region in ancient Palestine. Today, it is located in northern Israel.",
      "Online, some viewers believe Mary should have been portrayed by an Arab Palestinian actor in the new movie, pointing to modern conflicts in the region. Others defended the casting of a Jewish actor to play Mary.",
      "Caruso spoke to the casting decision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201c It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum, Caruso said it was his \u201cgoal\u201d to find an actor \u201cfrom the region where Mary was born to play her.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could find a great young Jewish actress, that would be amazing,\u201d he told Netflix\u2019s Tudum.",
      "\u201cI just know that Noa did an amazing job. She\u2019s a fantastic actress. She\u2019s got this grace and beauty, and at the same time, she\u2019s accessible. I\u2019m so proud of her performance, and I think it should be celebrated. It has nothing to do with politics,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the movie is to spread love, and art is hopefully a uniter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be something that separates anybody.\u201d"

      "Israel's defense minister has vowed that it would maintain \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d in the Gaza Strip after fighting ends in the Palestinian enclave, a day after raising hopes that a ceasefire and hostage deal was imminent.",
      "Israel was \u201ccloser to a ceasefire deal than we have ever been,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a closed-door parliamentary committee hearing Monday. The comment was confirmed to NBC News by an Israeli lawmaker who was present.",
      "While ceasefire talks have broken down multiple times in the past, two U.S. officials and an Israeli official\u00a0last week told\u00a0NBC News that Hamas relented on key points to securing an agreement.",
      "According to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Hamas agreed that Israeli forces would remain in Gaza temporarily after the end of hostilities, and Hamas would provide a comprehensive list of hostages, including American citizens, to be released.\u00a0Hamas would also see a large number of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel as part of the deal, the sources said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported these concessions.\u00a0Hamas has not confirmed to NBC News or others\u2019 reporting that it has agreed to Israeli troops in Gaza.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that \u201cserious and positive discussions\u201d had taken place in Doha, Qatar, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and that reaching a ceasefire agreement and prisoner exchange was possible if Israel \u201cstops setting new conditions.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday morning, Katz said Israel would maintain control over Gaza after the fighting ends.",
      "\"After the military and governmental power of Hamas in Gaza is defeated, Israel will securely control Gaza with full freedom of action\" he posted on X, likening this outcome to Israel\u2019s current control over the occupied West Bank.",
      "Katz did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for details on what \u201cfull freedom of action\u201d would mean. But the comparison to the West Bank underscores a key concern for Palestinians and their supporters: the fear of prolonged Israeli military presence in Gaza, akin to the West Bank, where Israel maintains ultimate control over territory and settlements, and carries out regular raids in the area.",
      "Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with Chatham House\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, said Katz' comparisons with the West Bank suggest that Israel is \u201cgoing to have full control entering by any means at any given time.\u201d",
      "\"That\u2019s a completely fair enough interpretation, considering that we know what happens in the West Bank,\" he said. \"Is that what a ceasefire agreement is going to say? I have my doubts.\"",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli hostage negotiator and frequent critic of Netanyahu's government, said he did not believe Katz' remark that Israel had never been closer to a ceasefire.",
      "\"I have difficult accepting that Hamas has dropped its fundamental demand of an obligation to end the war including full Israeli withdrawal,\" he told NBC News via WhatsApp.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has injected urgency into negotiations, repeating Monday his threat that there would be \u201chell to pay\u201d if no deal was in place by the time he was inaugurated Jan. 20.",
      "A senior administration official told NBC News on Friday that Trump\u2019s pressure was a major factor in Hamas relenting on two key issues during ceasefire and hostage-release talks with Israel.",
      "\u201cThere is a confidence we have not seen since May when\" President Joe Biden \"presented his proposal,\u201d the official told NBC News, acknowledging that Trump\u2019s warning that he wants to see a deal before he takes office was \u201ca big factor\u201d in recent concessions.",
      "The U.S. hopes to secure a ceasefire agreement before the end of the month, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week in a press conference in Tel Aviv.",
      "Recent developments in the region, including the weakening of Iran, the longtime backer of the terrorist group, the degradation of Hezbollah and the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, also contributed to the compromise by Hamas, the senior Biden administration official said.",
      "Negotiations to secure the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack have languished for months. According to Israeli officials, around 1,200 people were killed in the country during the attack and around 250 people were taken hostage \u2014\u00a0dozens of whom\u00a0are still being held by Hamas and other militant groups.",
      "More than 45,000 people, more than half of them women and children, have been killed in the Gaza Strip in Israel's military campaign following the attack, according to the enclave's health officials and aid organizations. Much of the Palestinian enclave has been destroyed and a majority of the population driven from their homes."

The move earned international condemnation and came after Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani said he has no interest in engaging in new conflicts.",

      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the footage. But an Israeli official who reviewed the video said the fireball was likely the result of a secondary explosion, citing the possibility of munitions igniting following an Israeli strike. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to discuss Israel\u2019s aerial campaign in Syria.",

      "The decision to expand the Israeli population in the Golan Heights comes after Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria had \u201ccreated a vacuum on\u00a0Israel\u2019s border and in the buffer zone established by the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement,\u201d which stipulated Israel\u2019s withdrawal from areas of Mount Hermon it occupied during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.",
      "\u201cIsrael\u00a0will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7th style attacks,\u201d it said.",
      "The warning was followed by the announcement that Israeli forces would remain on Mount Hermon \u2014 a key strategic peak inside a buffer zone that has existed with Syria for decades \u2014 through the winter after occupying the site.",

Maxwell, 62, was jailed for 20-years after a jury concluded that she played a pivotal part\u00a0in recruiting and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it was expanding its visa-free transit policy, allowing Americans and other eligible foreign travelers to stay in parts of the country as long as 240 hours, or 10 days, as officials try to attract more overseas visitors.",
      "China\u2019s National Immigration Agency announced the measure, which is effective immediately, on its WeChat account, saying passport holders from 54 countries are eligible. They include countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia, as well as the United States and Canada.",
      "Previously, travelers could stay in China visa-free for as long as 72 to 144 hours depending on where they visited, as long as they continued on to a third country or region.",
      "Travelers with confirmed tickets to exit China within 10 days can enter the country in 60 places across 24 provinces, including the capital, Beijing, and China\u2019s largest city, Shanghai. The expanded scheme also allows transit visitors to travel across regions during the 10 days, with some restrictions.",
      "Visa waivers for transit passengers are popular among travelers, including Americans, who might otherwise be required to go through a tedious visa process for travel to China or elsewhere.",
      "China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, has been trying to bring back international visitors as it struggles to emerge from three years of pandemic isolation, steadily easing its visa policies in recent months.",
      "Passport holders from 38 countries no longer need a visa at all, enabling them to stay in China for up to 30 days for business, tourism, family visits, exchange and transit purposes. Those countries include France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and even Japan, with which China has a historically tense relationship, but not the U.S.",
      "The immigration agency said in October that the number of foreign travelers to China had jumped nearly 50% year-on-year, while the number of visa-free entries was up almost 80%.",
      "Last month the State Department lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3, advising Americans to reconsider travel, to Level 2, or \u201cexercise increased caution,\u201d putting it on par with the travel advisories for France and Germany.",
      "The move was prompted by the Biden administration\u2019s announcement that it had secured the release of three Americans who had been detained in China for years.",
      "The Level 3 advisory, the second-highest level, had warned about \u201cthe risk of wrongful detentions\u201d in China, where there are more Americans detained than in any other foreign country, according to the Dui Hua Foundation, an advocacy group.",
      "Two of the three Americans officially classified by the State Department as wrongfully detained, Kai Li and Mark Swidan, were among those released in November. The third, David Lin, was freed in September after almost 20 years in detention.",
      "The language about wrongful detentions has been removed in the updated advisory, though it still warns of \u201carbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.\u201d",
      "Beijing said it hoped the updated U.S. advisory would promote academic and other exchanges between the two countries, which have fallen off dramatically amid pandemic restrictions and geopolitical tensions."

    "summary": "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
    "story": [
      "The aftermath of an \u201cexceptionally violent\u201d attack in early Bronze Age England suggests that at least 37 people may have been \u201csystematically dismembered\u201d and eaten, new research has revealed.",
      "The attack, which took place around 4,000 years ago, reveals a case of cannibalism and \u201cthe darker side of human prehistory,\u201d according to the study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "Over 3,000 bones were excavated from a 50-foot pit in Charterhouse Warren, around 20 miles south of the city of Bristol in southwest England.",
      "The bones, which were chosen for analysis because of the \u201csheer number of cutmarks,\u201d were first discovered by cavers in the 1970s,\u00a0 researchers said.",
      "They had more violence inflicted on them then what would normally be seen \"in a butchered animal bone assemblage,\u201d Rick Schulting, the study's lead author, told NBC News in an email Monday.",
      "Schulting, a professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at Britain's University of Oxford, said that the archeology at the site is \u201cexceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most\u00a0surprising thing is the\u00a0sheer extent of the violence carried\u00a0out on the bodies,\" he said. \"They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed\u00a0apart.\"",
      "The violence took place \u201cprobably in a single event between\u201d 2210 B.C. and 2010 B.C., researchers suggest, adding that it's a unique example of extreme violence in Early Bronze Age Britain and that \"nothing else on this scale\u201d has been recorded in Britain.",
      "However, Schulting said the extreme violence was unlikely to have been an isolated incident in the U.K. at the time. \u201cThere would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region,\u201d he added.",
      "Schulting said that determining the motive behind such as an attack is \u201cone of the hardest things to do in archaeology.\u201d But together with his fellow authors, he concluded in the study that the massacre was likely driven by a furious \u201cspiraling cycle of revenge\u201d within or between Early Bronze Age communities.",
      "\u201cTensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings such as theft or accusations\u00a0of\u00a0witchcraft and then escalated out of control,\u201d Schulting said in his email.",
      "The victims might have been eaten to \u201cdehumanize\u201d them and \u201ctreat them like animals,\u201d Schulting said, emphasizing that this was not the action of just a few individuals. \u201cThe number of victims and the time it would have taken to dismember the victims tells us that there must have been a large number of aggressors involved.\u201d",
      "The bones were found with faunal assemblage, or animal fossils, that also showed initial \u201cevidence of butchery,\u201d although they have not been fully examined yet, the paper said.",
      "The authors do not believe that the attackers were driven to eat the human remains because of hunger, as the bone fragments were found alongside these animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food."

    "summary": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence, paving the way for early elections in February.",
    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence Monday, paving the way for early elections in February and ending a turbulent year at the polls for several of Europe's leaders and governing parties.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote with the expectation of losing it, but with the hope that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of violating his trust at the time after Lindner publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon. The chancellor subsequently announced he'd call for a no-confidence vote.",
      "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier now has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election, and he is expected to do so after Christmas. New elections will then have to be held within 60 days of his decision.",
      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",
      "If Steinmeier allows the dissolution of parliament, something he is likely to rubber-stamp given his largely ceremonial role, a vote will take place just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled.",
      "Scholz called the confidence vote after weeks of infighting with his coalition partners on a 2025 budget and Germany's future economic policy prior to Lindner's firing.",
      "Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, a leading British investment bank, told CNBC that Germany's leaders are likely going to find agreement on fiscal policy regardless of the new election results.",
      "\"Even if within say the first three to six months of the new administration you don\u2019t get changes to the debt brake, if they have a big enough majority, eventually I think economic conditions will just force them to accept the reality that they need a fiscal stimulus,\" Pickering said.",
      "While the Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0led by Friedrich Merz, is ahead in the polls, according to Reuters, the far-right Alternative for\u00a0Germany\u00a0(AfD) could also help to shape the new government.",
      "Fresh from September's success in regional elections in Thuringia, when it became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, the party is also polling well at a national level.",
      "However, it is unlikely the group would be able to govern because other parties have refused to align themselves with the far right, despite Germany\u2019s parliamentary system traditionally producing coalitions.",
      "Germany's snap elections come after the Labour Party won power in the U.K. for the first time in over a decade and French President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections in his country, which led to political turmoil.",
      "Facing pressure from both the right and the left, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned earlier this month after he lost a confidence vote that\u00a0collapsed his government. It was the first time in more than six decades that a parliamentary coalition fell apart in France.",
      "Macron appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, a centrist, to replace Barnier last week in the hopes that he could bridge the deeply divided government."

      "A woman was arrested in Iran after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube, even though the Iranian parliament passed a new, stricter law on women's modesty that rights groups have criticized.",
      "Parastoo Ahmadi posted a 27-minute video of her concert performance Wednesday, in which she sang in a sleeveless dress with her hair down accompanied by four male musicians. In the caption, she described it as an \"imaginary concert\" and invited the audience to \"imagine this beautiful homeland\" in Iran.",
      "The performance was recorded in a caravanserai, the name for the roadside inns historically built along the Silk Road to provide merchants and travelers with places to rest as they trekked the ancient trade route spanning North Africa to Central Asia. Ahmadi wrote that it was \"where history and our myths intertwine.\"",
      "\"I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love,\" the caption said. \"This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.\"",
      "Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, told The Associated Press that Ahmadi was arrested Saturday over the performance. He said he was unaware of the charges, the arresting agency or the location of her detention.",
      "Iran's judiciary confirmed that a case has been opened into Ahmadi's performance but did not specify the charges. The statement, released by the state-run Mehr News Agency, also said Ahmadi was released after an interview with authorities.",
      "\"The Mazandaran Police Information Center announced that Ms. Parastoo Ahmadi attended a briefing session after posting a video deemed contrary to cultural norms and values,\" the agency said. \"She has been asked to appear before judicial authorities.\"",

      "Conflict over the issue drew international outrage once again in 2022 when a young woman named Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested outside a subway station in Tehran and accused of failing to properly wear a hijab. She was dead just three days later.",
      "Iran's government denied wrongdoing, claiming that Amini died of pre-existing medical conditions. Human rights groups, however, have cast doubt on that, and a United Nations fact-finding mission\u00a0asserted she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities.",
      "Her death drew rage throughout Iran, drawing women out to protest in droves despite violent crackdowns by authorities.",
      "The authorities who enforce the modesty laws, often called the morality police, have eased public confrontations with women over veiling since President Masoud Pezeshkian was elected this year. Pezeshkian campaigned as a reformist who opposed such types of morality police patrols.",
      "But enforcement has not stopped altogether, according to locals who have said the police are now instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate action. So-called anti-unveiling clinics have also been established, where women are encouraged to follow the hijab laws through \"therapy.\"",
      "Despite Pezeshkian's reformist approach, the parliament pushed even harsher laws about women's veiling this year.",
      "The Hijab and Chastity Law was originally submitted by former President Ebrahim\u00a0Raisi, who died in May, and it was ultimately passed in September, according to Human Rights Watch. Enforcement will go into effect for a three-year trial period, which the rights organization said will dramatically increase the punishments for women who do not comply.",
      "The new law extends the enforcement into online spaces, increases fines for violations depending on frequency, institutes a travel ban for offenders and includes long-term imprisonment as punishment, Human Rights Watch reported. Fines alone could be detrimental for many Iranians as the country's economy has struggled under the weight of years of sanctions and regional conflict.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Council's experts on Friday called for the law to be repealed, describing it as a \"comprehensive system of gender-based persecution.\"",
      "Pezeshkian himself criticized the law this month as difficult to enforce in both a statement on X and an interview on state television.",
      "\u201cWe should not do anything that disrupts the unity and solidarity of society,\u201d Pezeshkian said. \u201cWe need to have dialogue and engage in discussions about this issue.\u201d"

      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. has made direct contact with Syria\u2019s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) rebels as they transition from a militant insurgency toward a more legitimate governing authority.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\u201d Blinken said after talks in Aqaba, Jordan, with diplomats and representatives from several Arab nations.",
      "The U.S. designates HTS a terrorist organization, making it legally impossible to work with the group, but contact underscores ongoing efforts to change that designation as the U.S. and its allies look to support Syria's transition from Bashar al-Assad's rule.",
      "In a joint statement after the meeting, the governments of the U.S. and Turkey, the E.U., and Arab countries called for \u201ca more hopeful, secure and peaceful future\u201d in Syria, stressing respect for women and minorities and preventing \u201cthe reemergence of all terrorist groups.\u201d",
      "The statement stressed that \"the transitional political process must be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned [and] produce an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government.\"",
      "No representatives from Syria were at the meeting.",
      "The talks reflect cautious optimism over HTS\u2019 evolving role in governing Syria, with early signs of efforts to establish stability after 13 years of civil war, and within the nation's many factions.",
      "Front of mind for Washington is the return of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in Syria over a decade ago. Blinken said in Jordan that he had emphasized the importance of finding Tice in talks with Syria's new parties.",
      "Tice is thought to have been taken captive near Damascus in August 2012 while he was covering the country\u2019s civil war. But while thousands of prisoners were released when HTS took control of Damascus, Tice\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown.",
      "Obaida Al-Arnaot, an official spokesperson, said Syria\u2019s interim government had tried to find Tice, who is 43, to reunite him with his family but had so far had no luck. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that efforts to pinpoint his location in Syria were ongoing.",
      "In another sign of the shifting dynamics, Turkey announced Sunday that it has reopened its embassy in Damascus after 12 years, while schools and universities have also resumed operations in areas formerly controlled by Assad.",
      "Turkish Defense Minister Ya\u015far G\u00fcler\u00a0has said his country is ready to offer military training to Syria \"if the new administration requests it.\u201d",
      "In comments authorized for publication Sunday and translated by Reuters, G\u00fcler said Turkey saw no signs of a complete Russian withdrawal after satellite images appeared to show Russian forces packing up and dismantling military equipment at one of their key bases in Syria.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians are going to leave,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll do everything they can to stay.\u201d",
      "As the transition continues, there is concern for Syria\u2019s minority groups. Kurdish communities, in particular, have expressed wariness about HTS, given the group\u2019s past association with Al Qaeda and the uncertain future of ethnic and religious minorities under its control.",
      "In a message to the Kurds, HTS leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa, formerly known by the nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, sought to ease fears with a statement Saturday, stating that Kurds are \u201cpart of the homeland\u201d and that \u201cthere will be no injustice\u201d against them.",
      "\u201cThe coming Syria will have the Kurds as its foundations, and we will live together in it, and everyone will take their rights,\u201d he said.",
      "The message is part of HTS\u2019 ongoing efforts to project a more moderate image and distance itself from its Al Qaeda past, even as the U.S. continues to view the group as a terrorist organization. In 2018, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Al-Sharaa's head.",
      "Israel remains deeply concerned about extremists' gaining power in neighboring Syria, and it carried out multiple airstrikes on Syrian weapons depots and air defenses overnight into Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",
      "The attack appears to be the latest in a series of airstrikes that Israel says are aimed at preventing Assad\u2019s arsenal from falling into the hands of militants.",
      "But U.S. engagement with HTS may signal a potential shift in Washington's approach, sparking hopes that it may eventually remove the strict sanctions, which it has imposed on the country for decades and intensified at the start of the civil war in 2011.",
      "\u201cWe can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see, really, a rallying around building of Syria,\u201d United Nations envoy Geir Pedersen told reporters during a visit to Damascus to meet the new interim government.",
      "Biden has already outlined continued U.S. involvement in Syria, without commenting on whether Washington would remove or reconsider the designation.",
      "\u201cWe will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime, toward independent, sovereign and independent,\u201d he said last week. \u201cSyria with a new constitution, new government that serves all Syrians.\u201d"
